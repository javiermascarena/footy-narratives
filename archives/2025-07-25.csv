What are Isak's options - and how could Liverpool afford him?,"Alexander Isak has told Newcastle he wants to explore his transfer options this summer - but what are they and could Liverpool afford him?

Sky Sports News' Keith Downie, Lyall Thomas and Mark McAdam answer the key questions around his future.
Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
Isak is frustrated that he was denied the opportunity last week when Liverpool made an informal approach. Ektike, who was essentially meant to be his replacement at Newcastle, moved to Liverpool instead. From the outside looking in, that was another door closing for Isak.
Eddie Howe said something that stuck out to me in his post-match presser on Saturday after the friendly against Celtic. He said: ""I am really aware it's a short career for a footballer."" That to me is something that's likely been communicated to him by Isak or his representatives.
I think Isak feels, having been at Newcastle for three years, scoring 62 goals and helping them win the cup last year, he has done what he set out to achieve.
Isak's development has been almost faster than the club's. I'm not saying he's outgrown Newcastle, but he's in a position where he is one of the best strikers in Europe playing for a team that doesn't really have the opportunity to win the Premier League, you would suggest.
He is ambitious, wants to win trophies and feels he should be earning £250k to £300k. He's not earning that at Newcastle, and he knows the other top strikers in the Premier League are earning that money. I think he doesn't want to be denied the possibility of that earning potential.
Sky Sports News' Mark McAdam:
The fact that Liverpool made an approach last week suggests that they were willing to pay a fee at least in the region of what Newcastle are looking for, which is around £150m. That admiration hasn't just suddenly disappeared with the signing of Hugo Ekitike.
Liverpool are happy with their strike force and their squad, but that doesn't mean their business is finished. This is a new summer for Arne Slot. It's the first time he's really attacked a transfer window since being appointed a year ago.
He's had 12 months with the players, he understands the Premier League, he's a Premier League winner already and he wants to make Liverpool even better, and that means signing the very best players they possibly can.
Isak is certainly one of, if not the best, striker in the Premier League. Whether Liverpool decide they can fit both him and Ekitike into their plans remains to be seen, but it is certainly one to watch.
Eddie Howe believed he could fit Ekitike and Isak into the same team, so why wouldn't Slot?
Sky Sports News' Mark McAdam:
Quite simply, Liverpool can afford to do a deal for Isak because they are very sensibly and sustainably run by owners FSG and they have been for a number of years.
I spoke with an independent football finance expert who told me Liverpool could spend £500m in this summer's transfer window and still be PSR compliant because they are so well run.
In last summer's window, they only spent £12.5m on Federico Chiesa. They also generated around £60m in player sales. That means they've got a big wedge of cash in their pocket from last summer that was unspent, and that's helping them this summer.
Their turnover was £614m in their last set of accounts. It's going to be even more next time because of the commercial success, the football success and the bonuses that are attached to a lot of those commercial packages that they've set up. Therefore, the income is going to go up too.
In terms of player sales, Liverpool have generated more than £60m already. The four players they've moved on this summer have either been academy players, who represent pure profit under PSR, or have been sold on for big profits.
Then, if you add in the likes of Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott, those three players alone could raise another £150m. That would also create space in the forward line, potentially.
When you take that into account, their net spend potentially starts looking quite healthy on top of being a really well-run club.
Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas:
It looks unlikely. Arsenal were perhaps the only other club that could have truly rivalled Liverpool for Isak, but they decided to pursue Viktor Gyokeres and he is now expected to join from Sporting.
Chelsea are not in the running for Isak. They've signed Joao Pedro and Liam Delap already this summer and the club have complete faith in the options at their disposal up front. They think Isak is a great player, but he is not a Chelsea target.
Manchester United are potentially looking for a striker this summer. However, the prices involved for such a deal rule them out immediately. The focus for United currently is on player sales after signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.
Isak is not a player that has been under consideration at United and this latest development is not expected to change that.
Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas:
Newcastle's asking price for Isak is £150m, which eliminates all but a handful of clubs. Only the very top sides in Europe and some in Saudi Arabia could even contemplate such a deal with the figures involved.
Barcelona and Real Madrid are the two clubs that usually come up in such conversations, but as it stands, there is no indication that either club are in for Isak. Barca are currently unable to register their new signings so it is safe to rule them out entirely.
Paris Saint-Germain certainly have the financial might, but again there is no suggestion that the Champions League winners want to pursue a move for Isak, who would be directly competing for a starting spot with Ballon d'Or favourite Ousmane Dembele in Paris.
There has been talk of Saudi Pro League interest, but that is unlikely given Isak's aspirations to challenge for top trophies in Europe.
Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
He needs to be content. It sounds as though he's not content at the moment, given the fact he's asked to explore other opportunities. I think it's important to say he has not handed in a transfer request, but he's asked to explore other opportunities, which suggests to me that he's unsettled and he's been affected by the approach from Liverpool last week.
Eddie Howe is a brilliant man-manager. He's going to have to rely on all his man-management experience to get Isak's head into the right place ahead of the new season if he is to stay at Newcastle.
He is still a Newcastle player, we have to remember that. And if anyone is going to buy Isak, they're going to have to pay top dollar to get him.
There was talk, and there has been for a long time, that Isak would open contract talks over a new contract at Newcastle. That hasn't materialised. I think there's a frustration there on his part that his contract hasn't been increased, that his pay hasn't gone up.
I would suggest that the club might have to come to some kind of agreement with him if he was to stay, where he got a bit of a pay rise, and perhaps there was either a release clause put in that he could leave for a certain price next summer, or a gentleman's agreement, or something to placate him a little bit.
Because without doubt, there's a frustration on his part that he feels that opportunities are passing him by.
Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
I think the replacement was Hugo Ekitike. He essentially gets called mini-Isak. Very similar player, similar style, scores similar goals. Newcastle have liked him for over three years now, so that would have been the replacement.
There will be a real fear from Newcastle that not only have they missed out on Ekitike, but they could lose Isak as well. We know they're in talks with Brentford to sign Yoane Wissa, but that was to be the number two to Isak - not to spearhead their attack.
So the big question is, where would they turn next if Isak goes? Newcastle have explored a move for Benjamin Sesko at RB Leipzig. That's just in case Isak leaves and keeping him is a priority.
Sesko would be an expensive one, but Newcastle will have money to spend if Isak does go.
Remember, Newcastle already missed out on Liam Delap. They've missed out on Joao Pedro and they've missed out on Ekitike. So they're quite far down their list already.
I feel that once the dust is settled on this, Newcastle could come to some kind of agreement with Isak that should placate him a little bit going into the new season. They insist he's not for sale. If he is sold, it would be for mega money, around £150m.
Time will tell if Liverpool have got the money to spend on Isak as well as Ekitike.
What will be hugely intriguing is that Newcastle's first home game of the season is against Liverpool on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports. Which team is he going to playing for?

It is understood that has been communicated back to United after an initial inquiry was made.
Watkins is one of a number of strikers United have looked at along with others including Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
Villa do not want to sell Watkins, who is thought to carry a value in the region of £60m.
Villa have been keen on Alejandro Garnacho - a player United want to sell - but they are understood to be unable to meet their current asking price to buy him outright.
Garnacho's preference is to remain in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, but no such move has yet materialised despite some interest from Chelsea.
Any potential deals for the two players would be separate.
United's focus is now on player sales after buying Bryan Mbeumo for £71m from Brentford.
After Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona, United are working on exits for Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - as well as Garnacho.

Gyokeres heading to Arsenal after £63.8m deal agreed with Sporting,Viktor Gyokeres is expected in London on Friday after Arsenal agreed a &#163;63.8m deal with Sporting for the striker.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396301/viktor-gyokeres-transfer-news-arsenal-agree-deal-with-sporting-as-striker-heads-to-london-to-finalise-contract,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 11:00:00",,['Arsenal'],"Viktor Gyokeres is expected in London on Friday after Arsenal agreed a £63.8m deal with Sporting for the striker.
The Gunners will pay the Portuguese club a £55.1m (€63.5m) guaranteed fee, plus £8.7m (€10m) in add-ons.
Sky Sports News understands Gyokeres is due in London on Friday to sort final contractual details with Arsenal.
It is thought that the plan is then for him to join up with the squad in Singapore and complete his transfer from Sporting.
Bringing in a striker has been a primary focus for Arsenal in this transfer window - they have explored conditions for a number of players, including RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
Sky Sports News reported in June that Gyokeres was a Manchester United target after they made an initial approach for him through intermediaries.
Last month, Sporting president Frederico Varandas revealed Gyokeres would not be allowed to leave for less than £59m (€70m) this summer after disputing the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with the Swede's agent that would allow him to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m), plus £8.4m (€10m) in add ons.
After joining Sporting from Coventry City for around £20m in 2023, Gyokeres has scored an incredible 97 goals in just 102 matches during his two seasons in the Portuguese capital.
Gyokeres netted 54 goals in only 52 games in all competitions last campaign, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, as he helped Sporting win the league and the Portuguese Cup.
A move to Arsenal sees Gyokeres return to English football, having joined Brighton & Hove Albion in January 2018, before moving to Coventry after loan spells at St Pauli and Swansea City.
Gyokeres scored 43 goals for Coventry in his two and a half seasons with the Championship side.
For years, the football world called for Arsenal to sign a striker and the Gunners have finally responded. Viktor Gyokeres is on his way to the Emirates.
The move is set to be a standout one for the Premier League - no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting last season and it could herald the arrival of another elite goalscorer for the division.
But it is even more significant for Arsenal, given their spending under Mikel Arteta.
Read more on what Viktor Gyokeres can bring to Arsenal here...
Developments around Gyokeres come amid a busy summer of incomings at Arsenal.
They announced the signing of midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a £51m deal and another central midfielder, Christian Norgaard, arrived from Brentford for £15m.
Spaniard Kepa Arrizabalaga was signed for £5m from Chelsea, followed by a £52m deal for Noni Madueke.
And Arsenal are set to confirm the signing of Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera in an initial £13m deal.

'An important signing for Arsenal's future' - Gunners sign Mosquera from Valencia,Arsenal have completed the signing of Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia in a deal worth at least &#163;13m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13397102/cristhian-mosquera-transfer-news-arsenal-complete-deal-to-sign-defender-from-valencia,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:00:00",,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have completed the signing of Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia in a deal worth at least £13m.
Mosquera has joined up with his new team-mates in Singapore after agreeing a five-year contract.
The defender said: ""There's been a lot of hard work behind all of this.
""It's an opportunity that came up and I couldn't let it pass me by. I'm joining a historic, massive club. When you arrive here with your family, you really feel the greatness of this place.""
The deal for the 21-year-old, who underwent a medical in London, could rise with performance-related add-ons.
Mosquera had entered the final year of his contract at Valencia and turned down offers of a new deal because he wanted to join Arsenal.
Valencia's statement confirmed that Mosquera only wanted to join Arsenal.
""This decision comes as a result of the clear and unequivocal desire expressed by the player, who has made it clear he did not wish to renew his contract with Valencia CF and expressed his intention to join Arsenal FC exclusively,"" the Spanish club's statement read.
Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said of the signing: ""As a 21-year-old defender, Cristhian has already performed consistently well with significant experience in LaLiga. He is an intelligent player with good pace, who can play centrally and on both sides.""He is a young player with exciting talent and enormous potential, who will fit well into our squad as we continue to prepare for next season.""
Gunners sporting director Andrea Berta added: ""We're very happy and excited to have signed a hugely talented young player in Cristhian Mosquera. We identified Cristhian as one of the strongest young defenders in European football, and he is an important signing for our future.""
Mosquera was born to Colombian parents in Spain and joined Valencia at the age of 12, going on to make 90 senior appearances and scoring one goal.
He has also made 11 appearances for Spain U21s, starting all of their games at this summer's U21 European Championship before they were knocked out by England in the quarter-finals.
Mosquera is a naturally right-sided centre-back but has also played on the left and is expected to provide competition for both William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes.
Sky Sports' Nick Wright:
One of the best indicators of Cristhian Mosquera's quality can be found in the sheer number of minutes he has played. Since being drafted into the Valencia team at the age of 19 in August 2023, he has started 70 league games out of a possible 72.
In probably the most challenging position on the pitch tactically, and with all the pressure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in Spain as they navigated a turbulent period, the young centre-back came to be seen as undroppable by two different managers.
His total of 6,394 minutes played across the last two seasons is the highest by anyone aged 21 or under in Europe's top-five leagues. The volume of playing time highlights reliability and robustness. It also gave suitors such as Arsenal plenty to go on.
Clearly they liked what they saw, and they were not the only ones, with Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig also said to have tracked him. He heads to Arsenal with a reputation as one of the the most promising young centre-backs in Europe...

Mount says Man Utd should aim for European return,Manchester United midfielder Mason Mount says the club's focus is on qualifying for Europe next season.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gdgd82z5ko,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 22:24:52",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Qualifying for Europe is ""the focus"" for Manchester United this season says midfielder Mason Mount.
The 2025-26 campaign will be only the second season without European football for United since English clubs were banned by Uefa in the 1980s following the Heysel stadium tragedy.
Their 15th-place league finish last season and Europa League final defeat by Tottenham meant there will be no European matches at Old Trafford for the first time since 14-15.
""Europe is a massive, massive thing for us,"" Mount said.
""The Champions League would be amazing for us and as a group we want to be playing in that competition.
""But I'd say Europe. I think that's the focus.""
Ruben Amorim's side need to improve on their 24-25 performance, when they finished 23 points behind seventh-placed Nottingham Forest, who took up the last of the European qualifying places based on a league finish.
United have already spent more than £125m to bring in forwards Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.
They also continue to be linked with strikers, with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins' the most recent subject of speculation following suggestions of a move for Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.
Both rumours involved out-of-favour winger Alejandro Garnacho going the other way.
United sources are adamant no deal is imminent, with Villa privately saying Watkins is going nowhere.
The club have travelled to the Unired States for their three-match Premier League Summer Series campaign featuring games against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.
In the meantime, Garnacho and fellow outcasts Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are training with club staff at United's Carrington training complex.
Real Betis are still keen to bring Antony back to the club after last season's successful loan spell, while Juventus are keen on Sancho but need to create room in their squad before they can pursue any deal.

Rice 'didn't like' Madueke signing backlash,"New Arsenal signing Noni Madueke will ""shock a lot of people"" this season, says midfielder Declan Rice.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1k89kv2w27o,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 11:01:29",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice says he ""didn't like"" the reaction online from some fans about the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea, but backed the winger to ""shock"" with his talent.
Madueke, 23, joined for an initial £48.5m last week as Arsenal look to increase their attacking options.
However, the signing caused a backlash, with the hashtag #NoToMadueke posted across social media, and a petition started which had more than 5,000 signatures.
""I know how driven he is,"" Rice said after Arsenal's 1-0 pre-season win over AC Milan in Singapore.
""I've spoken to him and you're going to see what he's about this season. He wants to prove and show everyone what he really can do.
""He's hungry, he wants to play for Arsenal and that's the type of players we want. It's so positive.
""He's going to shock a lot of people and I can't wait for him to come.
""People have been speaking internally - the players, the staff. We know the player that we're getting and we're really looking forward to having him at our club. It's going to be really exciting.""
'That's an unbelievable trait to have'
Rice wrote a letter to Madueke when he signed for Arsenal, and the winger was seen reading some of it during the transfer announcement video that Arsenal posted across their channels.
Rice said the club came up with the idea and it was ""a nice little touch for him to join the club and feel welcome"", and Madueke had ""messaged me about it, saying that he really, really appreciates it"".
Madueke has been signed to support Bukayo Saka on the right wing and to challenge Gabriel Martinelli for his starting role on the left-hand side.
Madueke has been a regular for Chelsea over the past two seasons, scoring 20 goals in 92 appearances.
The Gunners have struggled to break down teams that defend deep against them at times and Madueke's ability to beat his defender is seen a huge boost to the squad as they look to win a trophy this season after coming so close in previous campaigns.
""When you're an attacking player and in your mind the first thought you have is to go past your defender, that's an unbelievable trait to have,"" Rice said about Madueke's ability.
""He's going to bring that to the squad along with the other wingers we have. Let's be real - last year we hardly had any depth in any areas.
""We played half the season pretty much with so many injuries, so to now be able to rotate and push in different competitions with different players is going to be really, really good. That's key for us.""
Rice ready to score more goals
Arsenal have been active in the transfer market and have completed deals for Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard and Kepa Arrizabalaga, with Cristhian Mosquera and Viktor Gyokeres expected to follow shortly.
Rice finished the season playing for Arsenal as a more advanced number eight and, with the signings of Norgaard and Zubimendi, it is expected that is where he will continue playing for the Gunners.
""I think the manager now sees me as a box-to-box player and I think at the back end of last season, off the back of Christmas, I showed fully what I can do in that position and I really kicked on.""
Rice scored nine goals and registered 10 assists in all competitions for Arsenal last season and is looking to better those numbers this campaign.
""I'm putting really big demands on myself this year,"" he said. ""I'm really trying to push myself because the back end of the season I finished really, really strong.
""At the start of the season last year I was nowhere near the level that I require of myself.
""I put it down to a few things - the back of the Euros final was mentally really tough, having 16 days off, going straight back into a Premier League season.
""More goals. More assists. Impact the games more. Not just do it at the back end of the season; do it in a full season and set myself some numbers.
""I think the best players in the world do that. They want to try and push themselves and that's what I'm trying to do and the manager is certainly on me to do that as well.""

Ex-Man Utd striker Hernandez apologises for sexism,Mexico striker Javier Hernandez says he regrets making sexist comments which saw him fined and warned about his conduct.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c79q939wdr7o,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 19:03:11",,['Manchester United'],"Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez says he ""deeply regrets"" making the sexist remarks that led to him being fined and warned about his future conduct.
The Mexican Football Federation (FMF) said the 37-year-old, now with Liga MX side Chivas, made a series of statements on TikTok ""promoting sexist stereotypes that are considered media violence and go against gender equality in sport"".
Hernandez said women are ""failing"" and ""eradicating masculinity"".
""Don't be afraid to be women, to allow yourselves to be led by a man,"" said the former Mexico captain on social media.
In an apology posted on Instagram on Thursday, he said it was ""never my intention"" to ""hurt or divide"".
""I deeply regret any confusion or discomfort that my recent words have caused,"" added Hernandez, who won two Premier League titles during his five-year spell at United.
He said he was ""listening, reflecting and committed to expressing myself with better clarity and sensitivity"" and he would ""take this opportunity to understand, grow and continue working to be a better version of myself"".
The original comments, which were made last weekend, were met with a backlash in Mexico.
President Claudia Sheinbaum, the country's first female president, said: ""Chicharito is a very good soccer [player] but when it comes to his opinion on women... he still has a lot to learn.""
In a joint statement, the FMF and Mexico's top men's and women's leagues said the Gender and Diversity Commission has started an investigation ""that seeks to prevent and punish this behaviour"", and it will ""take more severe measures in the event of a repeat offence"".
Chivas said the comments were ""contrary to the principles and values"" of the club and they had taken ""appropriate action"" against Hernandez, though they did not specify what that was.
Hernandez, Mexico's all-time leading scorer, joined Manchester United from Chivas in 2010.
Spells with Real Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen followed, before he returned to the Premier League in 2017 with West Ham for a three-season stint.
Hernandez left them for Sevilla, before spending four seasons with MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy.
He returned to first club Chivas in 2023, signing a two-year deal.

Arsenal sign defender Mosquera from Valencia,Cristhian Mosquera is set to join up with Arsenal's pre-season tour in Singapore after completing his transfer from Valencia.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2je763nlno,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 16:04:14",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal say they have secured ""one of the strongest young defenders in European football"" after completing the signing of Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia for an initial fee in the region of 15m euros (£13m).
The 21-year-old has joined the Gunners on a five-year contract, which has an option for a further 12 months.
Mosquera can play at both centre-back and right-back and will fill the gap in the squad left by the departure of Takehiro Tomiyasu, who mutually agreed to terminate his contract earlier this month.
""I couldn't let it pass me by. I'm joining a historic, massive club. When you arrive here with your family, you really feel the greatness of the place,"" Mosquera told the club's website.
""My career has moved faster than I expected and I've had to mature fast. Coming here is a chance to keep learning and improving.""
The Spain Under-21 international joined Valencia in 2016 as a 12-year-old before making his first-team debut in 2022 when he became the youngest centre-back to play for the club.
Mosquera made 90 appearances for Valencia and was a regular for them last season, playing the full match in 37 of the club's 38 La Liga games as they finished 12th.
Manager Mikel Arteta described Mosquera as a player with ""exciting talent and enormous potential"" while sporting director Andrea Berta hailed the defender's long-term prospects.
""We identified Cristhian as one of the strongest young defenders in European football, and he is an important signing for our future. Cristhian is a versatile defender who will strengthen our squad,"" Berta said.
He follows Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard and Noni Madueke in being added to Mikel Arteta's squad this summer, with Viktor Gyokeres also close to joining the Gunners.
Mosquera is set to join up with the Arsenal squad on their pre-season tour in Asia as he had already been given permission to travel by Valencia before the deal had been confirmed.
Arsenal beat AC Milan 1-0 in Singapore in the National Stadium on Wednesday and take on Newcastle United at the same venue on Sunday.
They then travel to Hong Kong to play Tottenham Hotspur before returning to London.
Mosquera gives availability and versatility - analysis
Arsenal have secured the signing of Mosquera and have added what they feel is a young defender with quality to add options to their backline.
He has played senior football for two seasons and in 2024-25, he not only played the most minutes of anyone in the Valencia squad, but also the second-most of any outfield player in the whole of La Liga.
That type of availability is important to Arsenal manager Arteta who will be hopeful to avoid the injuries which caused so many issues for him last season.
Alongside the availability, Mosquera can play across every position in defence, adding versatility to a strong Arsenal squad.
The 21-year-old may take time to adapt to the league and country but with a large contingent of Spanish speakers at Arsenal, the process of settling in should be a lot easier.

The answer may give England fans an extra glimmer of hope for Sunday’s Women’s Euro 2025 final because all of those competitions were won by the team who contested the first semi-final, 24 hours earlier than their opponents in the final.
Most women’s football tournaments used to schedule the semi-finals for the same day but, since that began to change about 20 years ago, it has been a trend in international tournaments for the winners to have come from the first semi-final. As the Lionesses prepare to meet Spain, who came through their semi-final against Germany a day later than England’s comeback win over Italy, it begs the question: how much of an advantage could it offer to Sarina Wiegman’s team?
Darren Robinson, a performance specialist and accredited sports psychologist who holds the Uefa pro licence coaching qualification, told the Guardian: “Having that extra time, from a physiology point of view, helps with muscle recovery; you’ll have a reduction in soreness with an extra 24 hours. Particularly in a multi-sprint sport like football, you do generally have a lot of muscle soreness; it’s multi-sprint, multi-turn, jumping, landing and all of these things create extension forces that cause muscle soreness, so that extra 24 hours helps a team be a bit fresher.
“I would suggest one of the benefits England have is resources, with the expertise that comes out of St George’s Park and supports the national teams: specialists in recovery, hydration and nutrition, meaning the players should benefit from some of those marginal gains, so the governing body has played its part when they’ve won games in the dying stages.”
England overcame Sweden on penalties in the quarter-finals and Chloe Kelly’s 119th-minute goal enabled them to edge past Italy in the semi-finals, setting up a repeat of the 2023 World Cup final in Australia. But in Sydney they were beaten by a Spain side who had played the first semi-final.
Excluding the 2017 Women’s Euros, when the semi-finals were on the same day, all the past 12 men’s or women’s Euros or World Cup finals were won by the first semi-finalists. Starting from Women’s Euro 2005, 18 of the 20 tournaments have had semi-finals on different days and of those 80% of men’s Euros or World Cups and 87.5% of the women’s Euros or World Cups were won by the first semi-finalist.
Nile Robbins, women’s high performance coach at the University of Stirling, told the Guardian: “How you schedule your sessions and your recovery looks completely different, based on whether you’ve got three or four days before you play your next game. But sometimes the main impact is not just physical, it’s mental. Take Spain v Germany, for example; Germany’s quarter-final game will have been far more emotionally and mentally draining than Spain’s.”
It appears it takes a great team to defy the disadvantage of playing in the second semi-final. Germany’s formidable women’s team managed it when cruising past England in Euro 2009’s final, and the all-conquering Spain men’s side managed to win Euro 2008 and 2010’s World Cup after playing second, exemplifying their rare excellence, but no other side have managed it in the past 20 years. Many will feel this talented Spain side, full of Barcelona stars, could be another such team capable of defying their shorter turnaround.

Robinson, who has also held various head of performance roles, mostly in the men’s Championship, including at Hull and Birmingham, said: “The other aspect which will be really important is they’re going to play the Spanish, who have controlled and dominated matches. Against a Spanish team capable of dominating possession, you need to be at full capacity.”
How teams recover from late-night matches varies, naturally, depending on the coaches and the regime but Robinson says: “Having protein shakes, hydration and carbohydrate replenishment, within the dressing room, that would start instantly after a game and the first 20 minutes are crucial, replenishing that lost energy.
“The challenge of course is after sport your appetite is suppressed, and particularly after a big game you’re celebrating and having something to eat or drink is the last thing that you want. And you can’t treat the whole group the same. While you’re piling food into the starting XI, you don’t want the players who didn’t play overeating. That’s why the culture and the discipline is so important. On the day after a game, we would definitely promote active recovery, so it could be things like going in the pool or jogging, exercise bikes or go for a walk together as a team.”
As some England players walked near their hotel on a hillside in Zurich on Thursday, perhaps their confidence grew, knowing that Spain also played 120 minutes in their semi-final. But Robbins, who has also worked at the University of Glasgow, says: “All of these things don’t automatically mean England will win but it does mean that they have those little advantages, and when the differences at the top level are so small, as little as 1% can make a huge difference.”

Alexander Isak open to leaving Newcastle with Liverpool his preferred destination,Striker not in squad for pre-season friendlies in Asia,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/24/alexander-isak-not-part-of-newcastle-squad-for-pre-season-friendlies-in-asia,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 16:35:46",Will Unwin,"['Arsenal', 'Liverpool']","Alexander Isak is open to a move away from Newcastle, with Liverpool his preferred destination. The Sweden striker has not travelled with his teammates on a pre-season tour to Asia and is looking into his options.
Isak has long been interested in joining Liverpool but the possibility of it happening this summer is remote. The striker has a contract until 2028 and the Premier League champions would need to raise funds through sales to afford a player valued at about £120m.
Liverpool signed another striker, Hugo Ekitiké, this week for £79m after concluding that Isak was out of reach. They may prioritise a centre-back over another forward. Newcastle had also been interested in Ekitiké but missed out after also failing to lure Liam Delap, who preferred to join Chelsea from Ipswich. Newcastle retain an interest in Yoane Wissa and have bid for the Brentford forward.
Isak missed a friendly at Celtic last Saturday and was left out of the 30-man squad that travelled to Asia because of what Newcastle described as a minor thigh injury. Eddie Howe’s side will play Arsenal in Singapore on Sunday and then face two fixtures in South Korea, against a K League XI and Tottenham.
Howe said after the Celtic game of Isak’s absence: “It was my decision. He travelled back to Glasgow with us but I decided to send him home due to the speculation around him. The last thing he wanted is to be sat in the stand watching, that wasn’t fair to him. But I’m confident he will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window.”
Newcastle have no desire to sell Isak as they prepare for a Champions League campaign. There has been an eagerness at the club to extend and improve Isak’s contract, after he scored 23 goals in 34 Premier League games to help the team finish fifth, but the 25-year-old has shown little enthusiasm for the idea.
Arsenal have made the Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera their fifth signing of the summer, taking the club’s spending to close to £140m. The Spaniard joins for an initial fee of £13m – with performance-related add-ons – and is understood to have agreed a five-year deal with an option of a further year.
The 21-year-old is set to provide cover for William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães at the heart of the Gunners’ defence, but can operate anywhere along the backline. Mosquera, who played 41 times for Valencia last season, has joined Arsenal for their tour of Singapore and Hong Kong.
“It means a lot to me,” Mosquera told his new club’s website. “There’s been a lot of hard work behind all of this. It’s an opportunity that came up and I couldn’t let it pass me by. I’m joining a historic, massive club. When you arrive here with your family, you really feel the greatness of this place.”

Manchester United need a new midfielder more than they need a new striker | Daniel Harris,United have lacked bite in the centre of the pitch for years and Ruben Amorim must prioritise this area to revive the side,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/24/manchester-united-need-a-new-midfielder-more-than-they-need-a-new-striker,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 11:00:14",Daniel Harris,['Manchester United'],"The way we discuss football has changed a lot in recent times, tactics and data to the fore. Nevertheless, there remain some simple, simplifying truths that, when delivered by someone with elite-level experience, must be taken seriously. So, when Graeme Souness reminds us that “the team that gets to the ball first wins”, we should pay just as much attention as when hearing about hybrid pressing, on-ball value and chance-creating actions.
The players most obliged to reach that ball first are, like Souness, central midfielders. And, though there are operative off-pitch factors, the longstanding absence of players able to do that is a significant reason why Manchester United have been so poor for so long.
This has not escaped the attention of Ruben Amorim. After last Saturday’s goalless draw with Leeds, he noted: “The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big. We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball.”
The problem, though, predates him by well over a decade – surprisingly so, given a relentlessly self-mythologising institution which has been home to some of the greatest midfields and midfielders. The Busby Babes featured a half-back line of Jackie Blanchflower, Duncan Edwards and Eddie Colman; the 60s side had Nobby Stiles, Paddy Crerand and Bobby Charlton; then, under Alex Ferguson, United moved seamlessly from Bryan Robson to Paul Ince to Roy Keane – who was partnered by Paul Scholes and flanked by David Beckham and Ryan Giggs, both comfortable playing inside.
Things changed, though, after the 2005 takeover when, constrained by the Glazer family’s debt and interest, Ferguson focused on stopping and scoring goals. The side that won the league and Champions League in 2007-08 boasted an all-time defence and attack but the midfield, though more than useful, was a weakness – one exploited by Barcelona in two Champions League finals, their superiority in that area putting United’s back four under pressure while stifling their front three.
Thereafter, Ferguson interpreted midfield in the most literal way possible: the middle of a field. Between signing Owen Hargreaves in 2007 and retiring in 2013, he signed only one player for the role, punting on Nick Powell – who could easily be categorised as a second striker. Instead, he accumulated wingers and strikers of different profiles able to turn tight games; in his final season, United won 16 league games by one goal.
In the 12 years that followed, United signed all manner of midfielders for all manner of amusing expense, namely: Marouane Fellaini, Ángel Di María, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Fred, Bruno Fernandes, Donny van de Beek, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro, Mason Mount and Manuel Ugarte, with Marcel Sabitzer and Sofyan Amrabat joining on loan. So far, only Fernandes could be said to have succeeded.
Footballistically, to borrow Arsène Wenger’s phrase, midfield has been United’s biggest failing; even Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side, the best of the post-Fergie wilderness years, were counterattackers not dominators. Indeed, it was when he tried to convert them into a more proactive outfit that things went wrong because, in the aftermath of Euro 2020, his back four collapsed and he lacked the midfielders able to protect it – respectively, Matic and Pogba lacked the legs and inclination to get to the ball first. Had the money spent on Harry Maguire been used to get Declan Rice, things might have worked out differently, but in the event United’s defence was open and their attack starved, because they couldn’t dictate games by controlling the centre of the pitch.
There are different ways of doing this. Pep Guardiola has deployed midfielders not just in midfield but also in defence and attack, while Jürgen Klopp used dominating athletes to run opponents off the pitch, with playmaking slack taken up by his full-backs. As soon as he tried something different, bringing in Thiago Alcântara, the balance departed.
Nor has it fully returned, last season’s title was based largely on the form of Mohamed Salah; Liverpool’s 41 goals conceded is the most by a champion side since United in 2012-13. In Europe, meanwhile, their relative lack of box-to-box class was exploited by Paris Saint-Germain and, though they have reinforced expensively and impressively this summer, the lack of work done in this area – so far – offers the chasing pack a chance.
United, though, cannot take such a risk. They began under Amorim as a team unable to create chances, their development into one unable to take chances a significant leap forward. As such, it makes sense that this summer’s priority was adding goals, but with that addressed by the acquisitions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, midfield must become the priority.
This is not to say the centre-forward Amorim wants is not necessary. But the market is offering little, while his system, fielding two midfielders where the majority of opposing sides use three, leaves a difficult gap to bridge; one Ferguson had to combat first when English clubs returned to Europe, then again when his famous four were shut down by Bayern Munich in 2001, then again in 2007 when Milan’s narrow diamond proved a problem.
The explosion in player athleticism means things have become harder since then. Though Amorim’s game model uses defenders, wing-backs and inside-forwards to create central overloads, it remains the case that he needs physical monstrosity in midfield – all the more so now he has decided that Fernandes, indefatigable but no one’s idea of a shuttler, is a No 8 not a No 10. Casemiro is no longer the man for this job, while Ugarte – a stop-gap whom PSG replaced with the infinitely superior João Neves – lacks authority, personality and quality.
Should United purchase the right midfielder, they will be in better shape than if they do not but do find a centre-forward. Prime Ronaldo Nazário would struggle in a team unable to dominate possession, whereas Joshua Zirkzee, Rasmus Højlund and Chido Obi have shown potential and, with creative quality behind them in a team able to pin opponents back, they would have more scoring opportunities and the chance to grow into a role one of them might yet make theirs permanently – something beyond Ugarte and this version of Casemiro.
Consequently, the centre of the pitch and the heart of the team must be Amorim’s only priority – United cannot afford to split their funds and wind up with someone not quite good enough in two positions. They must find the best, most suitable midfielder they can and only after that worry about what’s next because, though without the right centre-forward they will not be complete, without the right midfielder getting to the ball first, they simply cannot be good.
