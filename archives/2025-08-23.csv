"Unwanted records, 'scandalous' defending and relegation fears for West Ham","There was ""scandalous"" defending on the pitch and ""sack the board"" chants from supporters leaving the London Stadium early, as West Ham were thrashed 5-1 by Chelsea on Friday night.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13416536/west-ham-1-5-chelsea-unwanted-records-scandalous-defending-and-relegation-fears-for-west-ham,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 23:59:00",Peter Smith,['Chelsea'],"There was ""scandalous"" defending on the pitch and ""sack the board"" chants from supporters leaving the London Stadium early, as West Ham were thrashed 5-1 by Chelsea on Friday night.
Fans might wonder how, on an evening where their team were embarrassed by their rivals, no West Ham player was even booked.
The disastrous derby - on the back of a bruising 3-0 loss at newly-promoted Sunderland on the opening weekend - has already sparked talk of a relegation battle and under-pressure Graham Potter appears in desperate need of reinforcements before the transfer window closes in just over a week's time.
But with problems across the pitch and confidence battered, Potter now has a huge task on his hands to pick up his players before Tuesday's Carabao Cup trip to Wolves to stop this alarming start to the season spiralling out of control.
""I know we're only two games in, but that's a squad that's going to be in a relegation fight unless they give the manager some help,"" said Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp. ""They need four, five, six new signings. They haven't got the quality.""
They didn't have the application on Friday night, either, with Redknapp slamming the defending from Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Jean-Clair Todibo in the first half. ""When your players are defending like that you have no chance,"" he said.
Never before have West Ham conceded eight goals in their first two games of a top-flight season - but it was easy to see how they've managed it this time, with poor marking, a lack of intensity in their own box and an inability to be first or even second to crosses into the box.
Physically, the midfield was overpowered by a Chelsea team who only returned for pre-season a little over two and a half weeks ago. It is in desperate need of an injection of energy after also being found out at Sunderland.
""Fuming"" was the word captain Jarrod Bowen used to sum up his feelings about the whole situation. He had been feeding off scraps for most of the game, trying to make something happen amid his team's largely toothless attacking performance.
""We gifted the goals away,"" he said. ""Everyone has to look in the mirror and be brutally honest. We have to have a reaction.""
But how likely is that to come?
As well as their record number of goals conceded this season, Potter now has the unwanted record of being the first West Ham manager to fail to reach double figures for points in his first 10 home games.
His overall record is the second-worst of any West Ham manager in the Premier League era.
""Clearly what we're doing at the moment isn't enough,"" he conceded in a deflated interview with Sky Sports.
West Ham fans booed the team off at half-time and the few remaining when the final whistle sounded did the same. They also turned their ire on the club's hierarchy.
This summer the club fulfilled their obligation to buy Todibo - who was hooked at half-time when Potter ditched his back-five plan - and paid fees for Malick Diouf and Mads Hermansen, the goalkeeper who was relegated with Leicester last season, spilled a cross for a Chelsea goal and who, according to Redknapp, needs to be taken out of the team.
The only other additions were the free signings of Kyle Walker-Peters and Callum Wilson.
With Mohammed Kudus, Aaron Cresswell, Vladimir Coufal, Lukasz Fabianski, Danny Ings, Kurt Zouma and Michail Antonio gone, it's fair to question whether West Ham's transfer business has left them weaker than they were before.
They are certainly in a worse position after Friday night. Alarm bells are ringing - and it's only August.

Premier League predictions: Fulham to inflict another defeat on Man Utd,Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Fulham will inflict another defeat on Man Utd on Sunday.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415691/premier-league-predictions-and-best-bets-including-a-9-1-jones-knows-weekend-treble,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 21:15:00",Lewis Jones,['Manchester United'],"Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Fulham will inflict another defeat on Man Utd on Sunday.
Here's a sentence that would have made absolutely zero sense this time last year: Tottenham are becoming a serious set-piece threat.
Under Ange Postecoglou it was all vibes and vertical football, but under Thomas Frank there's good reason to believe Spurs could evolve into a set-piece machine. Brentford ranked second for expected goals from such situations last season in the Premier League and the early signs are positive for Spurs' ability to create havoc in the same vein.
Hello, Micky van de Ven.
He's not just a Rolls Royce in open play and with the ball - his power, pace, and timing make him an aerial asset waiting to be unlocked from attacking corners and free-kicks. In two starts under Frank, he's already amassed three shots and a goal against PSG.
He is 6/4 with Sky Bet to register at least one shot and while the markets remain sleeping on the true probability, he is a great bet to attack.
If you wanted some evidence about how much Brentford have potentially fallen in the summer, analysing their win price in the last meeting between these two clubs in March says a lot. The Bees, with Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and Yoane Wissa in tow, were 11/10 shots to beat Aston Villa at home.
They are priced up as 21/10 here just five months later, which indicates almost a five per cent implied probability shift.
That's massive when assessing outright prices.
They were utterly hopeless in the first half of their 3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest. First day nerves to blame? Or more a deeper underlying issue that this is a bigger rebuilding job than the club first imagined? I'm in the latter camp.
Sometimes in football betting, you just have to go back to basics.
Squad downgrade? Check. Squad imbalance? Check. Dangerous opponents who have one of the best managers in Europe? Check.
All signs point to a Bournemouth win over Wolves this weekend at 4/5 with Sky Bet - and this could be a bleak season for Vítor Pereira's men.
At home, with the crowd behind them and Wolves trying to implement Pereira's possession-based patterns under pressure, this game sets up nicely for Andoni Iraola's side and the fast and frenetic Bournemouth style. The Cherries may just squeeze Wolves into errors and feast on transitions. They may have lost a lot of quality in their dressing room but the most important man remains: Iraola - as shown by their performance at Anfield.
That's why they can be trusted to go again despite the squad overhaul.
The Premier League has become a league where pace, power, directness and ability to have real physicality off the ball is so key. This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.
I think Sunderland have noticed this trend and spent all summer planning to join the fast-break party because their recruitment has centred around bringing in big strong boys who either have lots of physical presence or carry great pace and power. They were so good on the break in the 3-0 win over West Ham. It was all about energy and progressive running.
Habib Diarra was the real star - this kid is powerful and full of direct running forward. Regis Le Bris gave him lots of license to support the front man and he fired in two shots, one of which was defined a big chance. He's 6/5 with Sky Bet to hit two or more shots again in a game Sunderland will be targeting three points from.
Beware: Declan Rice is a player I'll be rabbiting on about a lot this season.
Since moving to Arsenal, Rice has evolved into more than just a midfield shield. Under Mikel Arteta, he's given license to step into advanced pockets, recycle possession and let fly when space opens up. This positional change makes him a fantastic betting prospect in the attacking props markets.
Rice has covered his two or more shots line in his last six starts and boats an overall shots figure of 2.15 when playing in the No 8 role in 2025.
That figure should be capable of being hit against against a newly-promoted team, where Arsenal will dominate territory and Rice finds himself with time to test the 'keeper or pepper the goal. Combining Arsenal to win and Rice to have two or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet looks a nice angle to attack.
My first port of call whenever a key player leaves or suffers a serious injury is the with and without data to try and quantify how much a team will miss that player's output. Well, since the start of the 23/24 season, Eberechi Eze - on his way to Arsenal - hasn't started 21 games in the Premier League and in that time Palace's win percentage goes from 40 per cent to 19 per cent and their points per game drops from 1.5 to just 1.0 per game.
Oliver Glasner has a difficult job in keeping confidence and mentality levels high within his squad after losing such an important and well-liked player.
Forest are a trustworthy team as you know exactly what you're going to get in that they're very good in both boxes, and are led impeccably by Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo in defence - one of the best defensive pairings in Europe.
This looks a great time to head to Selhurst Park and the away win at 21/10 with Sky Bet does appeal.
One lazy narrative that has stuck out during the pre-season chat is how Everton could struggle without the fortress of Goodison Park and may suffer from new stadium nerves. However, the last five teams in the top two tiers of English football that have moved stadiums possess a healthy record across their first five games.
From those 25 games, they won 16 of them, losing just four.
Hill Dickinson Stadium has been strategically built to keep the atmosphere hot and hostile and when Everton fans turn up the noise, they remain one of the most passionate set of fans in the country. Brighton are a team overrated by the markets in my view and the 19/10 with Sky Bet on Everton starting with a win at their new home looks a solid wager.
The market likes what it saw from Manchester United against Arsenal based on their win price here. They are 21/20 with Sky Bet although it doesn't feel like particularly smart money is driving the United price into what it is. They still looked very timid in central midfield without the ball and doubts remain about whether the wing-backs - a key cog in any 3-5-2 system - provide enough attacking output to turn United into a functional and exciting team.
I like backing Fulham when they are overlooked. Marco Silva's men are mostly ignored by the market but they took 30 of their 54 points last season against top-half teams. That's a huge return and one that made them very profitable to back as outsiders when the price was right. You can get 6/4 with Sky Bet here on Fulham on the draw no bet market meaning stakes are refunded if the game ends level.
Eddie Howe is doing a great job at using the Alexander Isak situation to bring the club together as best he can.
When St James' Park smells disrespect, it bites back. You can expect the atmosphere to be a bearpit on Monday. Every Liverpool touch booed. Newcastle players pumped to play aggressively from the first whistle as they look to utilise that hotbed of noise to their advantage.
And that's when the Toon are at their most dangerous.
Despite the win vs Bournemouth, Liverpool appeared more vulnerable on the break than last season as they faced more fast breaks (5) in that game than in any Premier League game at Anfield last season.
And Newcastle are built to counter-attack with a front three of Anthony Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes perfectly equipped to hit Liverpool in transition. The hosts look a great bet in the double chance market at 4/5 with Sky Bet.

Can Arsenal be stopped from corners?,The warning signs were there for Manchester United before Arsenal struck.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415710/arsenals-goals-from-corners-how-can-premier-league-rivals-stop-mikel-arteta-and-nicolas-jovers-set-piece-tactics,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:00:00",Sam Blitz,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","The warning signs were there for Manchester United before Arsenal struck.
With the ball flying out towards an Arsenal corner, Diogo Dalot sprinted to quickly rectify the situation and concede a throw-in instead. ""That's quite important given how good Arsenal are from corners,"" said Sky Sports' Gary Neville on co-commentary duty.
But just 22 seconds later, Dalot could do nothing but concede a corner - and give Arsenal their first set-piece of the Premier League season. And, in classic fashion, they ended up scoring from it.
It was almost inevitable. Like last season, Declan Rice's delivery was on the money. Like last season, Altay Bayindir was unconvincing in clearing from underneath his own crossbar. Riccardo Calafiori could not miss on the line.
It is a common sight. Since the 2023/24 campaign, the Gunners have scored 31 goals from corners, averaging a goal every 16 attempts.
And given they average just under seven corners a match, it means the chances of them finding the net from a corner lies once every two or three games - if you are lucky.
Arsenal have been regarded as set-piece experts for around 18 months now - but scoring from their first set-piece of this Premier League season is a message to their rivals: put plenty of time and focus on trying to stop this, or they will hurt you.
So how can their Premier League rivals even start to think about stopping them?
Arsenal's corner routine begins like any other - with the taker, normally Rice or Bukayo Saka, putting their arm up in the air so the players in the middle know when to start their combinations.
But what those players in the middle are going to do is more unpredictable. Arsenal have had multiple routines but also multiple starting positions. Sometimes the Gunners players group together at the back post but at Old Trafford on Sunday, they all gathered on the edge of the box.
The reason why is to make short runs into the box and create momentum for when the ball arrives in the danger zone. But it also creates a bit of chaos, with opposition players being blocked off from trying to defend the ball.
""They've done it for a long period of time in terms of the timing - when they start moving, how they move, when they get to the dangerous area, whether it's the front or the back post,"" set-piece coach Marc Orti Esteban told Sky Sports.
Until last season, Orti Esteban was a set-piece analyst at Brentford before leaving to oversee New England Revolution's dead-ball department. Working under Keith Andrews, he was tasked with trying to work out how to stop Arsenal from set-pieces.
And his best advice to try to stop that Arsenal chaos? Control it.
""It's all about breaking their timing and what they do - they are very good at that,"" Esteban said.
""If you can stop that with physicality, stopping their runs, making it hard for them to move like they want to do, then you have a better chance of defending that situation.
""It's about being smart and knowing that they can deliver to the front or the back post. So you have to be covered in those areas.""
Teams have tried that in the past, putting a big focus on trying to halt Gabriel's run towards the penalty box. The Brazilian defender - who has 17 goals from set-pieces in the last five years - can sometimes be seen hovering in the middle of the penalty area, before attacking the ball with a run from deep.
The only issue with using physicality is Premier League referees are clamping down on that this season. There will be stricter punishments for tugging players back in the penalty area. ""I would expect this time next year for there to have been a few more penalties given for holding offences than what we've seen this year,"" said Howard Webb before this season started.
Arsenal will have to focus on that too, as their 'blocking' of defenders will be scrutinised a lot more. So it shows the importance of being street-wise when the Gunners get corners.
One of those 'street-wise' moments that Arsenal and their opponents have to monitor is how the Gunners players affect the opposition goalkeeper - a factor Manchester United found out on Sunday.
Goalkeeper Bayindir was deemed at fault for Calafiori's goal, but there was also some clever play involving William Saliba, with the Arsenal defender leaning into the United shot-stopper.
Despite the PGMOL looking to clamp down on holding in the box, the VAR deemed Saliba's intervention on Bayindir as ""normal football contact"".
With Arsenal looking to take advantage of every marginal gain a corner brings, this was another rule they managed to bend in their favour - especially given how they like to attack the six-yard box during corners.
It is not the first time Arsenal have tried and benefited from that tactic.
In the 3-2 north London derby win at Spurs, Ben White was seen doing a similar trick on Guglielmo Vicario - giving the Italian goalkeeper a shove - a bounce off the shoulder - so he would be unable to claim the cross, allowing Kai Havertz to nod in a close-range header.
It has not always worked, especially involving White. The England international tried a similar tactic in a 1-0 win at Leicester in 2023 - holding onto goalkeeper Danny Ward's glove in the hope that VAR would not catch it. But when Leandro Trossard found the net, it was spotted.
Bending the rules? Yes - but it is something that is seen a lot in Arsenal's corner routines. So a strong goalkeeper is a must.
Last season, some teams tried a new defensive corner tactic against Arsenal to help their defenders get to and clear the ball, including their goalkeeper.
Crystal Palace, Brighton, Monaco and Spurs all left two or three players up on the halfway line, meaning Arsenal were forced to leave a few players back. That not only decreases the number of players in and around the penalty box but also creates space for goalkeepers to come and claim the ball.
""Usually they come with six running into the six-yard box, causing a lot of noise and trouble"" Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner said last season. ""They are blocking, pushing, and then it looks like every single ball comes to the spot where they expect it.
""The Man Utd game against Arsenal [where Arsenal scored twice from corners in a 2-0 win], United had eight players in the six-yard box to defend, and I think they could have conceded five.
""We wanted that the box is clearer. It was.""
The only problem? Arsenal still managed to score from a corner against Palace through Havertz. That was because there were fewer defenders on hand to react to the German scoring after the ball came off the post. ""We defended the first ball but we didn't defend the second ball, the rebound,"" said Glasner.
""I think it was not an issue of having three players up, it was just that we have to be so sharp in every situation.""
After Palace tried that tactic, Spurs came to the Emirates and attempted something similar - but ended up conceding a goal from a corner themselves as Gabriel forced a Dominic Solanke own goal. It has not been seen again.
So no matter what teams end up coming up with to foil Arsenal, the Gunners keep on scoring. Leeds are their next visitors to the Emirates, with Daniel Farke's side putting a focus on set-pieces themselves this summer.
All of Leeds' summer signings are 5ft 11in and above. ""It's not a coincidence,"" said Farke - due to the importance of set-pieces in their survival fight. Will they have an answer against one of the biggest individual weapons in the Premier League?

"'We don't want players who don't want to be here,' says Frank amid Eze links","Thomas Frank said he would not sign ""players who don't want to be here"" after Eberechi Eze's U turn which left him on the verge of joining boyhood club Arsenal instead of Tottenham.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13416148/spurs-boss-thomas-frank-says-he-does-not-want-players-who-dont-want-to-be-here-after-eberechi-eze-opts-for-arsenal-transfer,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:30:00",Ron Walker,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Thomas Frank said he would not sign ""players who don't want to be here"" after Eberechi Eze's U turn which left him on the verge of joining boyhood club Arsenal instead of Tottenham.
Although the Spurs boss refused to name individuals, his telling comments came barely 24 hours after Eze decided against joining the club in favour of moving to their north London rivals Arsenal from Crystal Palace.
As far back as last weekend, there had been suggestions Eze would not be involved in Palace's season opener at Chelsea as talks with Spurs progressed, and despite starting and seeing a goal ruled out at Stamford Bridge a deal was agreed between the two clubs earlier this week.
That alerted Arsenal, who had enquired about the 27-year-old earlier this summer, to reignite their interest and steal an 11th-hour march on their biggest rivals, with the England winger undergoing a medical at London Colney on Friday.
Frank has made a reputation of never mentioning potential targets by name but when pressed on his frustration on missing out on another summer target, having already failed to sign Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White, he said: ""There's been a lot of rumours - and a lot of times where there's nothing in it. There must be someone out there who thinks it's good fun to put the rumours out there.
""There's been a lot of links and will continue to be. To be very general, I don't want any players who don't want to come to the club.
""If they don't want to come here and wear this fantastic badge, we don't want them here. That's very clear, and I imagine the fans feel exactly the same.
""That's a key message.""
Despite their disappointment so far this summer, bringing in only two new faces in Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus, Frank said he remained confident more arrivals would be forthcoming in the final 10 days of the transfer window.
He said: ""Of course, we want to do everything we can to be competitive. We have six very good front players who will be very competitive across all the competitions - and (Dejan) Kulusevski will come back this season, it's probably longer-term with (James) Maddison unfortunately.
""I'm confident though that we will sign another player before the end of the window. In general, any club wants to sign players as early as possible. If it was that easy, everyone would do it.
""I'm a positive guy, I'm not that fearful. I believe something will happen. I know the club is asking extremely hard, and unfortunately we can't go in Waitrose for five minutes and buy two very good players. It's a bit more complicated than that.
""I see the club is working hard, Daniel, Vinay and Johan - we're all on board in terms of being on board to see how we can improve.""
Richarlison had been mentioned as a potential makeweight in any deal for Eze, despite the Brazilian starting both of Spurs' two games so far - and scoring a superb double in the 3-0 win over Burnley last weekend.
Whatver the reason behind those reports of his impending departure, Frank gave his own public backing to the forward when asked about his situation at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
""Right now, Richarlison is my starting No 9,"" he said. ""He scored two fantastic goals, had two fantastic games and is the Brazil No 9.
""He's a fantastic player, he wants to stay, I want to keep him and there's been no talks about anything else.""

Mbeumo's running is already changing Man Utd,,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415998/bryan-mbeumos-running-power-already-helping-to-transform-ruben-amorims-man-utd-attack-the-radar,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:43:00",Nick Wright,['Manchester United'],"
Welcome to The Radar, a Sky Sports column in which Nick Wright uses a blend of data and opinion to shed light on need-to-know stories from up and down the Premier League. This week:
🔴 Mbeumo's running power🔄 O'Riley to replace Joao Pedro? 🔍 A player to watch this weekend
Manchester United face Fulham on Super Sunday hoping to build on the positives from their narrow loss to Arsenal. Bryan Mbeumo's performance was one of them. His debut, following a strong pre-season, underlined his potential to transform their attack.
It could be seen in his very first actions of the game.
Inside the opening minute, Mbeumo controlled a looping clearance in his own half then drove Manchester United deep into Arsenal territory on the break. Soon afterwards, he was latching onto a Bruno Fernandes through-ball and testing David Raya.
Manchester United ended up dominating possession against one of the Premier League's top teams for the first time in a decade. It was when attacking quickly and directly, though, that they looked most dangerous. Matheus Cunha helped but Mbeumo was key.
Last season, Manchester United directed a far higher percentage of attacks down the left than the right but the emphasis switched completely against Arsenal as they looked for Mbeumo at every opportunity. The former Brentford winger is their outlet now.
He finished the game having had more shots than any other player. He ranked top for touches in the opposition box and dribbles too. But it is his movement that makes it all possible.
Mbeumo made more attacking runs than anyone else in the division at Brentford last season and he occupied the same spot in the rankings on the opening weekend of the new campaign.
The 26-year-old has given Manchester United a new level of running power. His total of 30 attacking runs in his very first appearance for the club was only bettered by Manchester United players on five occasions in the whole of last season in the Premier League.
Ruben Amorim has said since his appointment last year that he wants his side to have more possession and thereby more control. But increasing their threat on the counter and on transitions is also seen as crucial. It is already clear that Mbeumo makes it possible.
Against Arsenal, Manchester United totalled four direct attacks and three fast breaks, a combined total beaten only by Liverpool and Bournemouth on the opening weekend and a significant increase on the side's averages under Amorim last season.
The trouble, of course, was that they were unable to make them count. The next challenge is to find a ruthless edge, starting at Craven Cottage. But Mbeumo's impact is evident, even after one game. Manchester United have glimpsed what they can become.
Matt O'Riley assumed penalty-taking duties for Brighton against Fulham last weekend following Joao Pedro's departure to Chelsea. Playing in the No 10 role vacated by the Brazilian, he offered a similar level of off-the-ball industry too.
His total of 66 pressures in the 1-1 draw with Marco Silva's side was the eighth-highest among Premier League players on the opening weekend. Crucially, O'Riley offered quality as well as quantity. No player made more pressures leading to turnovers. His industry helped create opportunities for Brighton to hurt Fulham.
Fabio Hurzeler praised his all-round contribution afterwards. ""He is doing a lot of work out of possession, so we are not only happy to have him because of the goal,"" he said. The Brighton boss will hope for more of the same from him against Everton on Super Sunday.
Injuries made it difficult for O'Riley to showcase those physical qualities anything like as much as he would have liked in his first season at Brighton following his £25m arrival from Celtic last year. He was limited to only 11 starts in the Premier League.
But despite interest from Italian clubs Napoli, Atalanta and Roma this summer, the early evidence this season suggests the club would be wise to keep hold of him as they adapt to life without his former team-mate, off the ball as well as on it.
Nottingham Forest have lost Anthony Elanga but they have gained Dan Ndoye. The 24-year-old marked his debut with a goal against Brentford and could cause Crystal Palace problems next.

Chelsea teenager Estevao shows promise in Palmer absence,Estevao Willian shows why Chelsea fans have been getting excited about his arrival after Cole Palmer is ruled out in the build-up to their win against West Ham.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ye7gnpjpeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 22:50:55",,['Chelsea'],"After Chelsea's star man Cole Palmer was ruled out in the warm-up of the Premier League encounter at West Ham, teenage sensation Estevao Willian stepped up to show why Blues fans have been so excited about his arrival.
The 18-year-old replaced England international Palmer for his first Premier League start, but gave the ball away with a flick for Lucas Paqueta's stunning sixth-minute opener for the hosts.
Yet that didn't faze the Brazilian forward as he proved why Chelsea were willing to pay £29m to bring him to Stamford Bridge, most notably with his first-half assist for Enzo Fernandez as the Fifa Club World Cup winners eventually cruised to a 5-1 victory.
That smart run and pull-back for Fernandez's close-range finish made Estevao, at the age of 18 years and 120 days, the youngest Chelsea player to assist a goal in the Premier League.
""He needs to adapt, he needs to make many mistakes to understand how the Premier League is different to Brazil,"" Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca told BBC Sport.
""We conceded after he did the flick. He needs to understand, but he is a fantastic player.""
Estevao chose Chelsea despite interest from many of Europe's leading clubs, including Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain and Manchester City.
He fits the classic ""wonderkid"" characterisation to a tee, joining the Blues off the back of much hype and tipped to achieve great things.
Estevao gave a glimpse of his talent in the Club World Cup, where he scored in the quarter-finals as former club Palmeiras lost to Chelsea, and first impressions of him in England have been positive.
""I think he's young but he showed that he's very mature,"" said Chelsea team-mate Marc Cucurella.
""He made very good decisions and all the new players, all the new signings came here to help the team, to bring something good, good energy, good talent. I think we have an amazing squad, so I hope we can do good things this season.""
Former England and Chelsea goalkeeper Rob Green added that, for Estevao, it looked like it was ""just a joy to play and go out there and express yourself"".
""It looked like he played where the shirt didn't weigh anything and there was no expectation,"" he told Sky Sports.
""There's a real freedom and a brilliant thing, having had time at Chelsea, you play with so many international players and the different ways they approach the game, going into the game, on the team bus.
""Brazilian players, it's like it's a party. It's there to be enjoyed. Let's go and play football, the excitement's there, let's go and enjoy it.""
'We are a much better team with Palmer' - Maresca
Chelsea were without their brightest star in Palmer against West Ham, but still excelled.
Maresca revealed the 23-year-old ""was not 100% in the past four or five days"" and a niggling groin issue ruled him out of Friday's fixture.
""He tried the warm-up, but he felt something,"" he added. ""So we prefer not to take any risk to get worse - and we'll see in the next hours if it's something important or not.""
Maresca admitted his side are ""much better"" when Palmer is available, but the Blues have proved they can perform well without him.
He said: ""The ones that they say that we are just a Cole team, for sure, Cole is our best player, no doubt. For sure, when we have Cole, we are a much, much, much better team.""
Cucurella also highlighted how Estevao helped fill the gap left by the ""difficult"" situation caused by Palmer's late withdrawal.
""It's difficult because we practice one thing, at the end we need to change very fast,"" said the Spanish left-back.
""But I think Estevao, in this case, played an amazing game. I think it's very important because we have a good squad, all of us, we are ready at any time and we are very happy because we showed we have a good team.""

We don't want players who don't want Spurs - Frank,"Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank says the club are not interested in signing players who are not fully committed to them, after Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze opted to join rivals Arsenal.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly4p22v30vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:44:43",Sean Kearns,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank says the club are not interested in signing players who are not fully committed to them.
Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze is set to join rivals Arsenal in a £67.5m deal, having been poised for a switch to Spurs earlier in the week.
Frank's side had been confident of landing the 27-year-old, but Palace wanted Eze to remain at the club until after Thursday's Europa Conference League match against Fredrikstad.
However, the England international was then left out of Palace's 1-0 home win against the Norwegian club after his boyhood club Arsenal agreed terms.
It is the second blow Spurs have suffered this summer, with Morgan Gibbs-White opting to sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest after Tottenham had activated a release clause in his previous deal.
""In general I don't want any players that don't want to come to this club and wear this fantastic badge,"" said Frank.
""We don't want them here and I'm sure the fans feel the same.""
Spurs, who beat Burnley 3-0 on the opening weekend of the season, travel to Manchester City on Saturday (12:30 BST).
With the transfer window set to close on 1 September, Frank remained confident of adding to his squad.
""We are in the market and we will look to strengthen the team,"" he added.
""We have a good squad and good players [but] we need to do everything we can to be as competitive as possible. I am confident we will sign a player before the end of the window. Every club wants to sign players as early as possible, but it's not that easy.""
Frank said striker Richarlison, who netted twice in the win against Burnley, is set to stay at the club.
The Brazilian, 28, had been linked with a move to Palace in part-exchange for Eze.
Arsenal host Leeds United on Saturday (17:30 BST), with Eze expected to complete a medical with the Gunners over the weekend.
But head coach Mikel Arteta said on Friday: 'I have nothing to comment.
""You know I can never talk about a player that's not part of our group or club yet.""

Eze's journey from Arsenal rejection to brink of dream return,The Eberechi Eze story - from being released by Arsenal to be on the cusp of a return to the club as a £60m superstar 14 years later.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn85d82q55zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 11:59:52",Neil Johnston,['Arsenal'],"It is a scenario familiar to thousands of aspiring footballers around the world. Eberechi Eze, aged 13 and with tears in his eyes, was told he was not wanted by the club he dreamed of playing for - in his case, Arsenal.
For many of those young players, that rejection is the end of their football dream. Not, however, for the resilient Eze.
Following multiple failed trials and subsequent spells at Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace, the playmaker looks set to come home 14 years later - as an England international - in a £60m move.
""I know so many people who got released from one club, got released from Arsenal, and that was it - they stopped playing,"" Eze told BBC Sport in May, days before scoring Palace's winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City.
""The fact I am in this position, I can only say 'God, thank you' because I could be anywhere doing anything.""
Eze was at Arsenal, the club he supported, for four years from the age of nine.
""Arsenal was everything,"" he said. ""Just to play there, to go in with the Arsenal badge and be the kid who plays for Arsenal, was special.
""Afterwards it became difficult. As a kid your identity is almost wrapped up in that. When you don't have it...""
After Arsenal, Eze had spells in the youth set-ups at Fulham, Reading and Millwall.
""I remember playing at Fulham in a game against Arsenal. Speaking to the academy director after the game, I had tears ready to pour down my face,"" Eze said.
""I remember he's talking to me and because of what Arsenal meant to me at the time... tears, that's it. But these are the things that shape who you are.""
These words will be music to Arsenal fans' ears - especially as they look poised to snatch him from under the noses of Tottenham Hotspur.
Spurs had been close to signing him from Palace before the Gunners hijacked the move.
BBC Sport looks at the low moments - and the rise - of Eze.
'He's exactly how people see him on TV'
Eze grew up playing cage football around Greenwich with his two brothers - who are also both footballers now.
Chimaechi Eze, 22, was released by the Crystal Palace academy this summer - and Ikechi Eze, 28, plays for non-league side Dartford.
""He's exactly how people see him on TV. Freedom, always smiling, laughing, a good character to be around"" is how Chimaechi describes his older brother.
""When he's playing, I don't think there's anything on his mind.
""Growing up where we're from, it forces you to get good at football quickly, otherwise you're in trouble because bigger boys are around. If you're not good, you have to go.
""My favourite football memory is at younger ages - me, Ikechi, Ebere going to the Rec or yellow cages to play football in the early morning and afternoon, and coming back in the evening. Playing football and doing what we love.
""It would get to nine or 10 o'clock and she [their mother] would have to send people to come and get us because we'd been playing out all day.""
After playing football, the brothers would watch clips of footballers - including Ronaldinho and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry - to try to learn their skills.
Ikechi added: ""When he was released by Arsenal he ended up very emotional. It showed his human side.
""By the time he was coming here [cages] he was already with academies.
""So the rare time he was allowed to come after a training session, you could tell he had something different from the other players we were kicking with.""
But Eberechi Eze has interests other than football too - and picked up £15,000 weeks before the FA Cup final by winning an online chess competition against other celebrity content creators and athletes.
Lisa Shaw, his teacher at Fossdene Primary School in Charlton, told the BBC: ""He didn't neglect his studies. He was always near the top of the class for his learning.
""When I saw he'd won the chess tournament I thought 'well done' but I wasn't surprised. He was always very determined to do well.""
She tells the story of him inviting children from his old school to watch Palace train.
""He sent a fleet of cars to pick them up. It was very generous,"" she says.
""The children look up to him. He has had a lot of setbacks in his career but he was resilient. That's why he's such a good role model.""
'Praying for a Sunderland contract'
After Arsenal, Eze spent two and a half years at Fulham's academy before being released. Then a trial at Reading resulted in a familiar sinking feeling.
Having been told by Millwall he would not be handed a professional contract at the end of a two-year scholarship in 2016, Eze had more unsuccessful trials - with Bristol City and Sunderland.
""I was there [Sunderland] for a week,"" said Eze.
""I remember getting home, lying on bunk beds with my brothers and praying: 'Please give me a pro contract, I know I can do it'.
""Then I got the news I hadn't got it. I remember the deflation.""
His confidence was at an all-time low. It would have been easy for Eze to give up on his dream of becoming a professional footballer.
After all, the youngster from a council estate in Greenwich, south-east London, had experienced nothing but pain, frustration and crushing rejection.
""But always it was 'what's next?' That's when QPR came,"" said Eze, who is a devout Christian.
""I feel like the journey I've been on has forced me to grow up, improve and be better.
""But the love of football never left.""
QPR coaches 'taught me it can't just be nutmegs'
By 2018, Eze had broken into the QPR first team following an impressive loan spell at Wycombe Wanderers.
""I met people at QPR who saw me and understood what I could do,"" he says. ""It was a journey getting there - so many clubs, so many rejections.""
He credits technical director Chris Ramsey, coaches Andy Impey and Paul Hall, and former England forward Les Ferdinand with helping with his development and building up his confidence at Loftus Road.
""I'm hugely grateful for them because that was the changing point in my career, and my belief shifted because of them,"" adds Eze.
""They opened my eyes. They taught me it can't just be nutmegs. They improved me massively, they saw potential in me. It was just about bringing it out.""
When Eze completed a £19.5m move across London to Crystal Palace in August 2020, he had 20 Championship goals to his name.
He had gone from Millwall reject to Premier League forward in the space of four years.
Does Eze feel any resentment towards the clubs who rejected him?
""I don't look back at any of the teams and say, 'oh, they shouldn't have released me',"" he says.
""That's the decision they made at the time and it made sense for them. Of course, now it looks like they've made a mistake. But at the time, it was probably clear for them to make that decision.
""So, I don't blame anyone, to be honest. I feel like the journey I've been on has forced me to grow up, improve and be better.
""I haven't been given anything. All that I have in football is because God has blessed me and given me the opportunity to apply myself and work hard for it.""
'Who's a better player than Eze?'
Eze turned out to be a sensational signing for Crystal Palace, having established himself under Roy Hodgson and Patrick Vieira then flourished under Oliver Glasner.
He quickly became hugely popular with players, coaches and fans at Palace.
Assuming the deal to Arsenal is completed, he will leave with 40 goals and 28 assists in 169 appearances for the club, including the most important strike in the club's history - the winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City.
He netted five of their 14 goals in that cup run. And then he also played in their Community Shield penalty shootout win over Liverpool.
""Who's a better player than Eze?"" Glasner asked last September after a League Cup winner from Eze against his former club QPR.
""For me he's absolutely top.
""He's always dangerous because he has the quality and ability. He's such an unbelievable finisher. He's a guy who can always score and he's someone who everyone likes.""
And Palace is where he became an England international, featuring in the Three Lions' Euro 2024 squad.
'He has shown you can change the narrative'
Talk to those who have known Eze since he was a boy honing his skills in a small yellow cage in Greenwich and there is immense pride at how far he has come.
""Growing up in south-east London, playing football in cages was a social thing with our mates,"" says Dajon Golding, a school friend of Eze's and now a striker at National League South side Maidstone.
""Even from a young age, Ebs always said he would play at the high level. A lot of us said that. We had big dreams and were naive.
""But it's a testament to Ebs that he has achieved it.""
Eze's younger brother Chimaechi said: ""Him showing that for the family helps everyone to push on when going through tough times. He is 100% an inspiration. He has shown you can always change the narrative.""
Despite his elevation to the England team, scoring against Latvia in March, Eze has not forgotten where it all started.
""I just got in contact with the two guys who taught me how to play football [in the cage], Gabriel and Rafael,"" he said. ""They are the reason I play football the way I do now.
""They showed me all the skills and I owe so much to them.
""This is why we play football. Of course you want to win and that's the main part of it, but the feeling of what you're doing to people in the stands and how you can get them off their feet...
""It feels like football is starting to shift a bit and there is not as much of that, but as long as I play that's what I want to do.""

Man City defender Dias signs deal to 2029,"Portugal defender Ruben Dias says he ""couldn't imagine playing for anyone else"" after signing a contract extension with Manchester City.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c98lm8v68nzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:01:35",Sean Kearns,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City defender Ruben Dias has signed a two-year contract extension.
The 28-year-old's previous deal had been set to expire in 2027 but his new deal will take him to 2029, with the option of a further 12 months.
The Portugal international joined City from Benfica for a fee of £65m in 2020 and was named Premier League player of the year at the end of his first season.
The defender has helped City to four league titles, the Champions League, the EFL Cup and the FA Cup during his five years at Etihad Stadium.
""I am incredibly happy today,"" said Dias.
""I love Manchester - it is my home now - and I love the Manchester City fans.
""When I think about the trophies we have won and the way we have played our football during my time here, I couldn't imagine playing anywhere else.""
Hugo Viana, City's director of football, said Dias is ""a leader in the dressing room and on the pitch"".
The club are likely to switch their attention to the futures of John Stones and Bernardo Silva in the coming months as both have one year left on their deals, while Ilkay Gundogan and Ederson both have less than 12 months remaining on their contracts.
Spanish midfielder Rodri, England playmaker Phil Foden, Swiss defender Manuel Akanji and Dutch centre-back Nathan Ake all have two years to run on their deals.
Defender Rico Lewis is close to signing a new five-year deal.

‘I have to do better’: Potter admits he’s under pressure after Chelsea defeat,West Ham manager insists ‘the players care’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/22/i-have-to-do-better-potter-admits-hes-under-pressure-after-chelsea-defeat,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 22:55:23",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"Graham Potter accepted that he has to improve after West Ham’s dismal start to the season continued with a humiliating 5-1 defeat by Chelsea at the London Stadium.
Potter, who is desperately looking to strengthen his struggling squad before the transfer window shuts, did not hide from the situation after his side followed up their 3-0 defeat by Sunderland in their opening game with another atrocious performance. The former Chelsea manager has made little impact since taking charge at West Ham in January and there is growing unhappiness behind the scenes.
“You are under pressure all the time in these jobs,” Potter said. “In this situation, that is how it is. I know the territory, I know what comes with poor results and I accept that responsibility. It was too easy to score against us so I take my responsibility and I have to do better. That is the case with all the players. They are honest and want to do more than they are at the moment.”
West Ham have conceded eight goals in their first two matches. Potter has criticised his players for failing to carry out the basics but he insisted that he has not detected a lack of effort.
“I don’t want to say it’s a lack of fight, I know the players care and are desperate to do well,” he said. “I know they want to do better than we are. Sometimes in football and life you hit a patch and no doubt about it, it has been a tough week. We have had a smash on the nose.”
Potter, who has picked up fewer points (nine) from his first 10 home games in the Premier League than any manager in West Ham’s history, did not want to say whether a relegation battle beckons. The club are hopeful of strengthening in midfield by signing Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa.
Chelsea, meanwhile, delighted in how they dealt with losing Cole Palmer to a groin injury in the warm-up. They fell behind early but were inspired by a scintillating full debut from Estêvão Willian.
“We conceded because of him, he lost the ball in the buildup, so he needs to make mistakes to learn,” Enzo Maresca said. “The performance was very good. That showed how good he is and the reason why he’s here with us.” Maresca added that Palmer has been dealing with a groin problem since last week.

"Tottenham only want players who wear club’s ‘fantastic badge’, says Frank",‘I don’t want players that don’t want to come to the club’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/22/tottenham-only-want-players-committed-to-clubs-fantastic-badge-says-frank,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 21:31:25",David Hytner,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Thomas Frank has made it clear that he only wants players at Tottenham who are committed to the club’s “fantastic badge” as the dust begins to settle on the Eberechi Eze saga.
Spurs reached an agreement with Crystal Palace for the transfer of the England forward on Wednesday and believed they had one with the player as well. Yet hours later, Arsenal swept in to gazump them and are primed to confirm his arrival in a £67.5m deal. If it is a coup for Arsenal and a dream move for Eze, who supported the club as a boy, it has been an episode Spurs would rather forget. They failed in a bid for Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White in July and are without their two main central attacking midfielders, Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison. Both have long-term injuries.
Frank did not want to talk specifically about Eze at his press conference on Friday, which was ostensibly to preview Saturday’s Premier League visit to Manchester City. But he had a message for the club’s supporters and it was hard to think he did not have Eze in mind as he delivered it.
“There has been a lot of links,” Frank said. “There’ll be a lot of links in the future. And just to generalise that … to make it very, very clear … I don’t want any players that don’t want to come to the club. Who don’t want to wear this fantastic badge. We don’t want them here.
“That’s very clear and I’m also pretty sure that the fans will feel the same. If they [the signings] don’t want to put the fantastic shirt over their head, play for the badge, play for the club, really enjoy it, no problem. We don’t want them. I think that’s a key message.”
Mikel Arteta refused to comment on the Eze deal as he prepared for the visit of Leeds on Saturday evening because the player was not yet a part of his squad. But the Arsenal manager did echo Frank in talking up the importance of signing players who identify with the club. “The number one thing is that they want to be with us, that they feel something special to come to us,” Arteta said. “We’ve done very well in the last few years to create a group of players and to build this spirit in the team and if they are supporting Arsenal, so much the better. The stronger the feeling, the better because it brings a different edge, a different will and an emotion to what you do. That always brings something extra.”
Frank said he was confident of adding to his squad before the closure of the window and it sounded as though he knew it was essential to do so. He name-checked six options for his front line – the new signing Mohammed Kudus, Brennan Johnson, Dominic Solanke, Richarlison, Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel. He did not include Manor Solomon, Kulusevski or Maddison. Frank was asked whether the group would suffice without reinforcements for a season that will include a Champions League return.
“It’s a good question,” he said. “Of course we need to do everything we can to make sure we are as competitive as possible. I think we’ve got six good front players and then Kulusevski – he will come back in this season. That’s a big thing. It’s probably longer term with Maddison, unfortunately. But I am also pretty confident that we will sign a player before the end of the window.”
Spurs have added João Palinha along with Kudus for the starting XI but they have lost Son Heung-min to Los Angeles Galaxy plus Maddison, who has ruptured his ACL, for the majority of the season. Is the squad stronger at present than it was last season? “You can say that’s two players in, two players out, so it’s probably pretty similar,” Frank said. “It’s up to me, together with the players and the staff, to make sure we can compete and then do what we can to strengthen.”
Frank said Richarlison wanted to stay and that he wanted to keep him, in the face of rumours about the striker’s future. “There’s been no talks about anything else,” he said.
Arteta, meanwhile, believes Arsenal will be better equipped across the attacking third this season. “More creativity, more weapons, having the ability to bring different profiles on the pitch at different stages in the game,” he said. “This is something that for sure we’re going to have more of this season.”
The Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, praised the impact that Eze had for him after he took over from Roy Hodgson in February 2024, culminating in the famous winning goal against Manchester City in May’s FA Cup final.
“I’m a big NBA fan and the crunch time is when the superstars are on the court,” Glasner said. “Ebs, in crunch time, when we needed him, he was here. This is what I will always remember. This is what great players are doing. We could count on Ebs in the crunch time, in the final, in the very important games. This is what he gave to Crystal Palace.”

Manchester United close on signing Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens in €20m deal,23-year-old expected to compete with André Onana,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/22/manchester-united-close-on-royal-antwerp-goalkeeper-senne-lammens-20m-deal,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:17:05",Jamie Jackson,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Manchester United are closing in on the signing of the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens for about €20m (£17m), with the 23-year-old expected to compete with André Onana.
Onana’s place at United has been under scrutiny following a string of unconvincing displays after his arrival from Inter for £44.4m in July 2023. The Cameroon international was left out of the squad for the opening-day loss to Arsenal last weekend only to see his replacement, Altay Bayindir, make an error that directly led to Riccardo Calafiori’s winning goal.
Onana expects to remain at United beyond the current transfer window having been made aware that the club have rebuffed inquiries from other clubs for his services but he is now poised to face further pressure for his place from Lammens.
The 6ft 3in Belgium Under-21s international made his senior debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later, making a first appearance for the club that November in a 2-0 Champions League defeat by Porto. Sources in Belgium suggest United have agreed terms with the player but it is understood that is not yet the case.
Onana is likely to miss part of the season because of his involvement in Cameroon’s Africa Cup of Nations campaign in Morocco. Their opening match is against Gabon on Christmas Eve.
Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim says it is “not a good thing” to have four first-team players training away from the squad and not being considered for selection. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia, and have been working separately since the start of pre-season as they seek moves away from Old Trafford.
None of the four were included in the squad for United’s pre-season tour, nor did they feature in the opening-day defeat to Arsenal. They will also not be part of the squad that travels to Fulham on Sunday. United will ideally seal exits, permanent or temporary, for the quartet before the transfer window closes on 1 September. But if they do not leave, Amorim is open to reintegrating them into his squad.
“I know that is not a good thing to have players in this situation but it’s clear they want to play in a different club,” Amorim said. “We try to arrange everything for both parties to be happy, so I have to try to imagine to have the training with the guys that I think are going to be the future and the other guys are training and preparing for the next chapter. When the window is closed it’s a different history,we have to receive the players and in a new life.”
Garnacho has attracted interest from Chelsea; Sancho has held talks with Roma; Antony could potentially return to Real Betis where he spent the second half of last season on loan; and Malacia is a target for Celtic, Besiktas and Porto. United are yet to sell a player for a fee this summer. Of the senior players under contract, only Marcus Rashford has departed. The England forward joined Barcelona on a season-long loan, with the Catalan club covering his wages.
Benjamin Sesko is likely to start in attack at Craven Cottage after coming off the bench for his debut against Arsenal last Sunday.
Speaking about the situation in goal, Amorim said: “Onana is ready to play like last week, so we will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper”

Rúben Dias commits his future to ‘special’ Manchester City until 2029,Central defender signs two-year contract extension,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/22/ruben-dias-commits-his-future-to-special-manchester-city-until-2029,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:14:16",Jamie Jackson,['Manchester City'],"Rúben Dias has signed a two-year contract extension with Manchester City that keeps him at the club until 2029, with the central defender saying he “couldn’t imagine playing anywhere else”.
Since signing for City from Benfica in September 2020 for £62m, Dias has claimed 10 trophies under Pep Guardiola and was a key member of the team that won the treble in 2023. In all he has played 223 times for the club, has 68 Portugal caps and was the Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year in his debut season in England.
“My job now is to be the best I can be for the duration of this contract, so that I can play my part in helping us challenge for more silverware,” said the 28-year-old. “I want to thank my teammates, Pep, Hugo [Viana, City’s sporting director], the coaching staff and everyone at the club. This is such a special place, and I am grateful every single day for the support I receive. Now the hard work begins, and I want to promise the fans that I will give everything to win more trophies and bring more success to City.
“I love Manchester – it is my home now – and I love the Manchester City fans,” added Dias. “Their support from day one has been absolutely unbelievable, and I appreciate them a lot. When I think about the trophies we have won and the way we have played our football during my time, I couldn’t imagine playing anywhere else.”
