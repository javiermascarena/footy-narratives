How did Gyokeres do on his full Arsenal debut? And what's next for Dowman?,"There was a huge roar before kick-off. Arsenal have a new striker, a new No 14 - a centre forward that the football world asked Mikel Arteta to sign for years.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13407848/viktor-gyokeres-how-did-arsenals-new-striker-do-in-his-first-start-against-villarreal-amid-max-dowmans-star-showing,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 17:14:00",Sam Blitz,['Arsenal'],"There was a huge roar before kick-off. Arsenal have a new striker, a new No 14 - a centre forward that the football world asked Mikel Arteta to sign for years.
Come full-time, the No 14 being talked about was the number of touches Gyokeres managed on his first Arsenal start, rather than the aura of the Swedish striker following in the footsteps of Thierry Henry and his iconic shirt number.
The 27-year-old was given an hour by Arteta in Wednesday's 3-2 defeat to Villarreal and it was a quiet start to life in north London. In his brief touches on the ball, Gyokeres managed two shots. One blocked, one saved.
It was slightly underwhelming, a minor anti-climax. But Arteta saw promising signs.
""He's been with us only a week or so,"" said the Arsenal manager after the game. ""But I already saw a lot of things and a lot of purpose, especially the way he was attacking in certain spaces.""
Gyokeres attacked the box unlike any Arsenal centre forward in the current era. It took the Swede just 30 seconds to pull away into the left channel, take the ball into the box and cross. There was an unwanted tap-in on offer.
Arsenal have a centre forward in Kai Havertz who tends to move to the right channel to link up with Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka. The Gunners have a different option in Gyokeres for a different flank.
Then there was a moment late in the first half, when Gyokeres stood up two defenders and barged through both of them. Again, he pulled the ball back for a cross, but nobody was there.
It brings us nicely onto the next key feature of Gyokeres' game: being within the width of the posts.
In the past, Arsenal have had options like Havertz and Gabriel Jesus and come for the ball, and while there was a bit of that with Gyokeres, his desire to stay on the last line and wait for chances in the box was clear.
Saka managed to beat his opposite man on two or three occasions in the first half, with Gyokeres in position from close range to pick up on any scraps. He nearly got on one in the opening period, but instead whacked the ball into Christian Norgaard on the stretch.
Then came his moment in the second half. Gyokeres was played through to the right of the box and had a tight angle, but still forced a solid save from Villarreal goalkeeper Luiz Junior.
It was an attack through the middle of the pitch - Arsenal ranked 20th out of all Premier League teams in that statistic last season. It was also a curved run in behind - instead of a link-up attack that Havertz is used to - that opened up a stubborn defence.
It ended up being Gyokeres' last action of the game, with him substituted at the hour mark. It is clear that the Swedish striker still has some fitness to catch up on.
""I think it was very important for him to start a match and start to have the feeling and the connection with the team,"" said Arteta.
""His fitness level, I think he hasn't trained really with a team for two months, so he's done now five or six sessions, I think, before today. So, on Saturday [against Athletic Club], I think he will take another step and he will be in a better condition.""
Arsenal's plan over the next 10 days or so is to prepare their new striker for that Premier League opener against Manchester United, live on Sky Sports. ""I hope days,"" Arteta said about how long it will take Gyokeres to get up to speed.
Gyokeres still has a few hurdles to go through. His first 90 minutes, but also a first match with Martin Odegaard behind him.
""Every day in training, I think he's getting a really good feeling,"" added Arteta. ""I think he's built connections as well outside [the pitch], which I think is really important with players that are going to help him to be in the position that he needs to get in.""
And will he be ready for the trip to Old Trafford? ""I think mentally and understanding what he needs to do, it will be 100 per cent or more,"" added the Arsenal boss. ""Because he's so willing and so confident as well that he can deliver straight away.
""I have no doubt that he will be in a really good place.""
Alongside Gyokeres was the impressive Max Dowman, who once again solidified himself as one of the most talented teenagers in the game.
Just like against Newcastle in Singapore, the 15-year-old came off the bench and showed the fearlessness of a player twice his age. Just like against Newcastle, it was one superb solo run too many for the Villarreal defenders, who had to bring him down for a penalty.
Dowman's industrious running was epitomised by the statistic that he attempted four times as many dribbles as Saka against Villarreal, in just a third of the time.
""He continues to impress, without a doubt. The impact he had in the game again today, the efficiency that he shows in every attack and action, it's incredible,"" said Arteta.
""Again, he deserves to have chances, and if he continues like this, let's see what happens.""
Dowman is becoming a phenomenon to English audiences, but to his Arsenal team-mates, it is nothing new. Even last season, the then-14-year-old was training with Arteta's first team but was not allowed to play in the Premier League or the Champions League due to age rules.
""With Max it's been so fast,"" added Arteta. ""Even last year, when he was training with us, he was doing this kind of thing in training and now he's doing it in the game consistently.
""So the three or four games that he's played, he's managed to impact and have big moments in the game. Great.""
Many believe Dowman's competitive debut will come this season, at the same age that Ethan Nwaneri made his professional bow back in 2022. While Dowman cannot feature in Europe until New Year's Day - as players must be 16 or over to feature in the Champions League - he now has permission to play in the Premier League.
But for those expecting Dowman to turn up at Old Trafford and continue the show, Arteta has put a pin in that idea. Firstly, Nwaneri spent two seasons with the U21s before becoming a first-team regular. But for Dowman, he needs a small break first.
""Let's see how it goes,"" said Arteta about first-team minutes. ""Let's go into Saturday, into the break as well. He needs a little break because he hasn't had any holidays really.
""He's going to have a break, which I think he needs. And then, following the week, he'll be ready again to go.""
From this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

Son departs as a Premier League icon - but how do Spurs replace him?,"'Cheers, Son's crying' was the meme that constantly followed Heung-Min Son's Tottenham career. Instead, it was those around the South Korean who were in tears last week.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13407687/heung-min-son-tottenham-hotspur-captain-leaves-premier-league-as-an-icon-but-how-do-spurs-replace-him,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 14:00:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"'Cheers, Son's crying' was the meme that constantly followed Heung-Min Son's Tottenham career. Instead, it was those around the South Korean who were in tears last week.
As the full-time whistle went in Seoul on Sunday, the emotions spilled out as Tottenham's captain appeared for the final time in Spurs colours.
Ben Davies, who named Son as the godfather of his child Ralph, was crying at the departure of his friend. Other team-mates showed their emotions - but even the Spurs media staff cried on the field, ahead of the 33-year-old starting his new adventure at LAFC.
Except Son was not just Tottenham's captain and leader. ""Sonny is Tottenham and Tottenham is Sonny,"" said James Maddison before his team-mate's finale. In a decade at the club, Son wove himself into the hearts of the Spurs: players, staff, supporters - and even rivals.
Firstly, there was Son the player - and he departs the Premier League as one of the all-time greats to grace it from abroad. ""One of the best players who has ever played in the Premier League as a winger, in my opinion,"" said Thomas Frank as Son announced his departure.
The numbers make it hard to argue with that. If Mohamed Salah and Kevin De Bruyne are the two standout Premier League players of the last decade, then Son could make the argument that he is in third or fourth place in that list.
Son even ended his Premier League career with more goal contributions than De Bruyne, who spent exactly the same number of years in England's top-flight as the South Korean.
And the goals Son scored over the years were memorable too. He scored the first of Spurs' new era in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium against Crystal Palace. His Golden Boot-winning campaign was signed off with a double at Norwich, which saw the home fans give him a standing ovation off the field.
There were also nine north London derby strikes against Arsenal.
In Europe, he scored twice in the opening 10 minutes at Manchester City in a Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie in April 2019. Harry Kane was missing with injury that night, but Son stepped up and Spurs memorably progressed on away goals.
Son's partnership with Kane was another key factor of the modern Spurs era. The duo hit record-breaking heights in north London.
The Premier League has seen many memorable partnerships down the years. Shearer and Sutton, Henry and Bergkamp, Silva and Aguero, Drogba and Lampard. But none were a better double act than Son and Kane.
The pair combined for 47 Premier League goals, smashing Drogba and Lampard's record by 11 strikes. Their 14 set-ups for one another in the 2020/21 campaign is also an unmatched Premier League feat.
Were it not for the 32 goals set up by Son, Kane would also not be Spurs' all-time record goalscorer. It proves how instrumental the South Korean was to the Spurs era, but also to their star striker.
How Kane and Son are remembered at Spurs individually creates some debate. Yes, Kane was the generational goalscorer who fired the team to relative success. But Son will always be remembered as the one who stayed. The one who would later guide the team to the trophy he craved, in this year's Europa League.
In fact, Son was the only member of the 2019 Champions League final team who was at the club last season. He is the only one out of that team, Mauricio Pochettino included, who delivered a trophy for the club.
Amid rumours over Kane's future for years, Son never approached the Spurs board asking for a way out himself. He probably had every right, given he scored 40 Premier League goals in the two seasons either side of the summer where Kane was pursued by Manchester City. But his commitment to Spurs always resonated well with the club's fanbase.
It brings us on to the next part of Son's legacy that leaves with him. The human being.
Son always had a humility about him right from when he entered Spurs. The winger initially suffered from homesickness upon arriving in England. ""He struggled to settle,"" said Pochettino back in 2016.
The close friendships he forged with the likes of Davies, Dele Alli and defender Kevin Wimmer helped him pull through, and the role of Pochettino was important too.
Son's first full season in England did not fare well, so much so that the South Korean asked to leave in the summer of 2016.
Pochettino responded by putting Son in the team for the 2016/17 campaign, with Son immediately paying back the trust. He fired Spurs to their best start to a season in 50, before helping them finish as runners-up that term.
""I'm impressed with him as a man as well as a footballer,"" added Pochettino. ""He's a very nice person and how he works is impressive."" Others in the media would find that out too.
Any interview with Son would see the South Korean always shake the hands of every person in the room. He always seemed to understand the sacrifices people made to meet him. Even at his arrival in Los Angeles this week, Son spent more than an hour signing autographs.
There was also the story of when Son first came to England and saw a neighbour was throwing a family birthday party. He turned up to introduce himself - and he would then forge close relationships with those who lived around him, no matter their background.
It would be no different when Son replaced Kane as Spurs captain. He would prove to be a sounding board for any new player, his generosity extending to helping others settle in. After all, Son had struggled himself.
""He's nice, so nice,"" said Pape Sarr to Sky Sports during his first season at the club. ""Even if I say something wrong [in English], he tries to understand it to put me at ease.
""Since the first day I met him, we got on. We have a good friendship, he helps me a lot and gives advice on the pitch and off it. I appreciate that a lot and he's one of my favourites in the team.""
But Son would be no more popular than in his native South Korea. The forward's spell at the club allowed Spurs to tap into the East Asian nation on a commercial level. There, Son is regarded as a rock star.
That was even seen in England, with South Korean flags not only at every single Tottenham game - but a significant number of supporters from the country would even queue outside the club's training ground on a daily basis, just for a glimpse of their hero.
Spurs may have retrieved the vast majority of the £22m the club paid for him back in 2015, but Son paid off that fee a long time ago. He has left a unique presence on the Spurs squad during his decade at the club.
None more so than being the player to lift the trophy to end the 17-year drought. The perfect ending.
While Son's presence as a leader will take some replacing, how the team fill his goal contributions will be an immediate concern for head coach Thomas Frank.
Even in Son's final season, which saw him dip in levels for the first time in a Spurs shirt, he still registered 17 goals and assists last term. No Spurs player managed more.
There is a wider context too. Second in that list was James Maddison, who could miss the start of the campaign after being stretchered off in Son's final game in Seoul against Newcastle. Dejan Kulusevski, who got 15 goal contributions last term, is also working his way back to fitness after knee surgery in May.
Spurs have recruited Mohammed Kudus from West Ham this summer, but the attack will need bolstering even further.
Frank's interest in a No 10 is evident through the failed pursuit in Morgan Gibbs-White, who was the subject of a £60m approach from the north London club.
The injuries to Maddison and Kulusevski have heightened the need for a player in that position, but will a winger be required to replace Son?
Frank was coy about that out in South Korea, hinting that an internal replacement is more likely through Brennan Johnson, Wilson Odobert or Mathys Tel, who the Dane admitted while on pre-season tour is more of a winger than a striker.
With Cristian Romero set to step in as captain, how Spurs replace Son could be one of the main talking points when they begin a new era under Frank.

'Hardest decision ever' - Son leaves Spurs to join LAFC in MLS record deal,Heung-Min Son has left Tottenham after 10 years at the club to join Los Angeles FC for a Major League Soccer record fee of over &#163;20m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13407005/heung-min-son-transfer-news-tottenham-captain-joins-los-angeles-fc-in-mls-record-deal,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 20:01:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Heung-Min Son has left Tottenham after 10 years at the club to join Los Angeles FC for a Major League Soccer record fee of over £20m.
The forward had announced his decision to leave Spurs at a press conference ahead of their pre-season friendly against Newcastle in the player's native South Korea last Sunday, which was his final game for the club.
Son revealed he made his decision to depart a while ago, but only told a few players. Spurs boss Thomas Frank knew of Son's decision ahead of their first pre-season game at Reading earlier this month.
The 33-year-old wanted to move to MLS despite renewed interest from Saudi Arabia.
In a post to Spurs fans on Instagram, Son, who has signed an initial two-year deal with LAFC with options for a further two, wrote: ""How to find the right words for this? I don't know. I have been thinking for days. It's impossible. But here I go.
""It's time for me to say goodbye to Tottenham Hotspur. My home for the past decade. When I arrived in 2015, I didn't speak English, I didn't know London, but you welcomed me with open arms, believed in me, and stood by me through every high and low.
""I was just a boy from Korea with big dreams who was supposed to have no chance. And now, 10 years later, North London is in my heart forever.
""I've made friends for life here, had the honour of becoming a godfather here, and had the privilege of captaining our special club here. I've poured my heart and soul into this club, which makes this the hardest decision ever.
""I thought if I was ever going to leave, it would have to be on my terms, on the best terms, when our mission had been accomplished together. With pride and honour.""
Son is fourth on the list of Spurs' all-time record goalscorers - behind only Harry Kane, Jimmy Greaves and Bobby Smith.
Son has 173 goals and 101 assists for Spurs in all competitions, including 127 goals and 27 assists in 333 matches in the Premier League.
His last competitive game for the club was the Europa League final win over Manchester United in Bilbao last season.
The winger was a second-half substitute in that match and lifted the trophy after full-time - Spurs' first major honour since 2008.
Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said: ""Sonny is one of the greatest players to ever wear the famous Lilywhite shirt and he has been a joy to watch over the past decade. Not only is he a wonderfully gifted footballer, but he's also an incredible human being who has touched hearts and inspired people throughout the Club and all over the world.
""The Europa League triumph in Bilbao was a truly magical moment in the Club's history and Sonny lifting the trophy is a perfect lasting memory from his fantastic decade at Tottenham Hotspur.
""Sonny has given so much to this Club, both on and off the pitch, and for that we are forever grateful. We wish him all the best for the future, and he will always be welcome back at the Club as a beloved and cherished member of our Spurs family.""
Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:
Heung-Min Son will go down as one of Tottenham Hotspur's standout players of the modern era. There is even a fair argument to say he is the standalone Spurs icon of this generation.
Harry Kane may be Spurs' all-time record goalscorer, but Son will always be remembered as the one who stayed.
Kane gave Spurs fans more goalscoring moments down the years, but Son holds just one moment - the trophy lift in Bilbao - which stands above all in terms of Spurs' recent history.
And it is worth remembering that many of Kane's goals came from Son's assists. Statistically speaking, Son was one-half of the deadliest striker partnership in Premier League history.
Son and Kane set each other up 47 times across 229 games together - no Premier League pair has managed more. The 2020/21 campaign was the highlight of their partnership, with their 14 assists for goals between them the most in a single season.
Thomas Frank described the South Korean as one of the greatest Premier League wingers of all time, and his numbers are definitely up there.
Not only is he fourth on Spurs' all-time top goalscorers list, but he is 16th on the Premier League's scorers chart - and one of only 34 players to be in the Premier League 100 goals club.
Since his Premier League debut, only Mohamed Salah has more goal contributions. Son even has more than Kevin De Bruyne in that time, despite the Belgian joining Manchester City in the same summer that Son arrived at Spurs.
All that plus a lovable character that even rivals fans could not argue against, it highlights that Son is not just a Spurs legend, but a Premier League one too.

Liverpool reach agreement with Al Hilal to sell Nunez,Liverpool have reached an agreement with Al Hilal for the sale of Darwin Nunez.&#160;,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13407724/darwin-nunez-transfer-news-liverpool-agree-56-6m-deal-to-sell-uruguayan-striker-to-al-hilal,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:09:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have reached an agreement with Al Hilal for the sale of Darwin Nunez.
The Saudi Pro League club have offered a fixed fee of £46.2m (€53m) plus add-ons that could take the deal to £56.6m (€65m).
It is understood that Liverpool are yet to be informed that Nunez has given his greenlight to the move.
Sky in Italy are reporting that Al Hilal are prepared to meet Nunez's wage demands.
AC Milan were interested and made an approach, but were unlikely to ever match these figures.
Should Nunez leave Anfield he will do so having scored 40 goals in 143 appearances for the club since a 2022 move from Benfica, which initially cost the Reds £64m at the time.
Despite scoring 18 goals in Jurgen Klopp's final season he managed only seven last term under Arne Slot, though did bag two vital stoppage-time goals to give Liverpool a 2-0 win at Brentford in January.
South American football expert Tim Vickery:
""I would be very sorry to lose him. He's a player that always gives you something and I'm still hoping Nunez can evolve this move in another direction.
""He's Uruguay's cutting edge. His record for Uruguay is very good indeed. He's an optimist of the goal - he's always trying, always putting himself around, running into the channels.
""Although there are some Liverpool fans who have a resistance to him, there are many who really appreciate his efforts.
""This year, going into the World Cup, it's an important move to make and he may come to the conclusion that going to Saudi will leave him fresher for the World Cup, but he would be a loss to the Premier League.""
Jamie Carragher says he wants Liverpool to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle, but has questioned whether the club should be spending such big money.
Earlier in August, Liverpool made an initial bid of £110m plus add-ons, Sky Sports News reported. However, the total offer did not reach £120m, with the Magpies valuing the striker at £150m.
Liverpool have also signed Hugo Ekitike this summer, who can also play as a No 9, and Carragher says splashing out on the forward to have him potentially be a back-up 'doesn't sit right' with him.
Speaking on The Overlap, he said: ""It will be an amazing signing. But from a Liverpool fan point of view, I don't want the club to spend £150m on Isak.
""I could probably imagine that he was Liverpool's No 1 target but there's something about Liverpool buying a striker [Ekitike] for £80m and he's a back-up. There's something about it that doesn't sit right to me.
""I look at Isak, he's obviously thrown his toys out of the pram once Arsenal and Liverpool signed a striker. From him and his agent's point of view, did they not tell Newcastle months ago that they wanted to move on? It just seems a little bit messy.""

Newcastle are braced for a second bid for Isak, however he is unlikely to be sold unless the club can find a ready-made replacement. Their move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko looks to be usurped by Manchester United.
Liverpool have also signed Hugo Ekitike this summer, who can also play as a No 9, and Carragher says splashing out on the forward to have him potentially be a back-up 'doesn't sit right' with him.
Speaking on The Overlap, he said: ""It will be an amazing signing. But from a Liverpool fan point of view, I don't want the club to spend £150m on Isak.

""When I think of Liverpool, it doesn't look really planned. I don't think the plan is to sign a striker for £80m and sign one for £120m.
""I feel for Ekitike a little bit. Because he's been brought in and then all of a sudden this Isak thing has come.
""I do want Liverpool to sign Isak, but £150m for me feels like a Mbappe. You should be getting Mbappe for £150m.""
Isak did not go on Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia, citing a thigh issue. He instead took part in a personal training camp at his former club, Real Sociedad.
The Sweden international returned to Newcastle's training ground earlier this week for treatment on his injury. It is not clear if he has met with head coach Eddie Howe, with the squad having returned from South Korea over the weekend.
Sky Sports Data Editor Adam Smith:
Alexander Isak scored 23 goals in the Premier League last season - second only to Mohamed Salah.
The Sweden international also outperformed his expected goals (20.42), underlining his elite-level finishing and composure in front of goal.
The 25-year-old consistently finds space around the penalty spot, where he converts a high proportion of his shots. But he's far more than a poacher: six of his 36 efforts from outside the box found the net - demonstrating his range and technique.
The chart below benchmarks Isak's per-90 stats against other strikers in Europe's top five leagues. He excels across a wide spectrum - from goalscoring and dribbling, to opposition-box entries and link-up play.
On Wednesday, Liverpool reached an agreement with Al Hilal for the sale of Darwin Nunez.
It is understood the Saudi Pro League club are set to pay a fixed fee of £46.2m (€53m) plus add-ons that could take the deal to £56.6m (€65m).
Latest from Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
""The Darwin Nunez deal to Al-Hilal could have ramifications for Isak because obviously that's Liverpool another striker short, and they were looking for one anyway, which is why they made that bid on Friday for Isak of £110m plus add-ons, which of course was flatly rejected by Newcastle.
""But that just adds a bit more intrigue to the Isak situation because there's another spot up for grabs in that Liverpool attack with Nunez about to leave.
""So that will be interesting to see what happens there and whether Liverpool still come back in despite the fact Newcastle have yet to essentially replace or bring in a replacement for Isak.""

Everton approach Man City over possible Grealish loan,Everton have approached Manchester City over a possible deal to sign Jack Grealish.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13398156/jack-grealish-transfer-news-everton-approach-man-city-over-possible-loan-deal-for-england-winger,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 14:05:00",,['Manchester City'],"Everton have approached Manchester City over a possible deal to sign Jack Grealish.
Talks will focus on the possibility of a season-long loan, though negotiations are at an early stage. He is a player much admired by David Moyes.
Grealish is desperate for more game time as he looks to force his way into England boss Thomas Tuchel's thinking for next summer's World Cup.
It is expected that if a deal is to materialise, it is likely to be later in the window.
He has been working with a personal trainer in a bid to ensure he is in the best possible condition for the upcoming season.
Pep Guardiola has offered no guarantees that Grealish will remain at the Etihad, and the £100m club-record signing has been struggling for regular games.
He made just one Premier League start last season, and was an unused substitute at Wembley for the FA Cup Final defeat to Crystal Palace.
However, Grealish remains one of the biggest earners at the Etihad, and it is understood that it would be difficult for Everton to afford all of his wages, which are thought to be worth £300,000 per week.
That issue will now be the focus of talks between Everton and City, as they try to reach an agreement over how his salary will be shared.
Everton have confirmed the signing of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Chelsea on a five-year deal.
Sky Sports News reported earlier this week that the fee is an initial £25m plus add-ons that could increase it to around £29m.
Dewsbury-Hall made 36 appearances for Chelsea last season and featured in every game on their way to the Conference League title. He also won the Club World Cup with the Blues this summer.
He is Everton's fifth signing this summer, with David Moyes regularly expressing his need for more additions ahead of the new season.

LAFC 'changed my heart' - Son leaves Spurs for MLS,Tottenham Hotspur confirm that Son Heung-min has joined Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC on a permanent transfer.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyrqzjj8ypo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 21:58:09",Alex Brotherton,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Son Heung-min admits a move to Los Angeles FC was not his ""first choice"" but a chat with the club's president ""changed his heart"" to join for a record Major League Soccer (MLS) fee.
BBC Sport understands LAFC have paid a fee in excess of £20m for the former Tottenham Hotspur captain, whose two-year contract has the option of an additional two years.
Son revealed in a news conference on Saturday he would leave Tottenham after 10 years at the club.
The 33-year-old was present at LAFC's 2-1 Leagues Cup win over Mexican side Tigres UANL on Tuesday.
The fee paid to Spurs for the South Korean surpasses the previous MLS record of £16.5m paid by Atlanta United to sign Emmanuel Latte Lath from Middlesbrough in February.
""It's a dream come true. LA - what a city,"" said Son on Wednesday.
""If I'm honest, it was not my first choice. But the first call I had with [LAFC co-president] John [Thorrington] after my season finished, he changed my mind, changed my heart, my brain.
""He showed me the destination where I should be. Now I'm here, I'm more than happy, I'm so excited.""
In a club press release published earlier, Son was quoted as saying: ""Los Angeles has such a rich history of champions, and I am here to help write the next chapter. I'm excited for this new challenge in MLS. I have come to LA to lift trophies and give everything for this club, this city, and its fans.""
Son joins an LAFC side currently sixth in the Western Conference and reunites with former Tottenham team-mate Hugo Lloris.
He made his final appearance for Tottenham in a 1-1 pre-season friendly against Newcastle in Seoul, South Korea, on Sunday.
After arriving from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015 he scored 173 goals in 454 appearances for Spurs.
He was captain when Tottenham beat Manchester United in the Europa League final in May to clinch their first trophy in 17 years.
Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said: ""Sonny is one of the greatest players to ever wear the famous Lilywhite shirt and he has been a joy to watch over the past decade.
""Not only is he a wonderfully gifted footballer, but he's also an incredible human being who has touched hearts and inspired people throughout the club and all over the world.
""Sonny has given so much to this club, both on and off the pitch, and for that we are forever grateful.
""We wish him all the best for the future, and he will always be welcome back at the club as a beloved and cherished member of our Spurs family.""

Gyokeres 'will be in really good place' for start of season,"Mikel Arteta says new Arsenal signing Viktor Gyokeres will be ""100%"" ready for the start of the new season after making his first start in 3-2 defeat by Villarreal.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckgj2vqd0zqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 21:00:23",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"It was only a pre-season friendly against Villarreal, yet there was still a feeling of excitement and anticipation heading to Emirates Stadium as Arsenal supporters looked to see new £64m signing Viktor Gyokeres in action.
Fans are desperately hoping the 27-year-old striker will be the missing piece whose arrival allows the Gunners to lift a trophy for the first time since 2020.
The loudest cheers before kick-off were for Gyokeres when his name was read out in the starting line-up. The only noise to rival it came for the introduction of talented 15-year-old Max Dowman.
There was expectation every time the ball went near the Sweden international and it looked as though his team-mates were also trying to make sure Gyokeres scored on his first start, and at his new home ground.
That did not happen as Arsenal lost 3-2 to the La Liga side, with another summer signing Christian Norgaard and captain Martin Odegaard on target in each half.
But there were promising signs, and the hour Gyokeres played will be crucial to his fitness before Arsenal start the new Premier League season at Manchester United on Sunday, 17 August.
Having not trained with a team for two months after leaving Sporting, and with another Arsenal game to follow on Saturday against Athletic Bilbao, manager Mikel Arteta said the forward will ""100%"" be ready for the Old Trafford test.
""I think mentally, and understanding what he needs to do, he will be 100% or more,"" added the Spaniard.
""Because he is so willing and so confident he can deliver straight away, I have no doubts he will be in a really good place.
""We already broke that line today, because I think it was very important for him to start a match and start to have the feeling and the connection with the team.
""He's been with us only a week or so, but I already saw a lot of things and a lot of purpose, especially the way he was attacking in certain spaces.
""So, in general, for a lot of players that haven't played many minutes, we have a lot now that they're going to be ready for Saturday [against Bilbao] in a much better condition.""
Building fitness and connections
Arsenal seem to be trying to get the ball into the box a lot quicker as they attempt to play to Gyokeres' strengths.
He was close to getting on the end of a first-half cross, before wafting a leg at an awkward delivery and then being denied by a good save when played into the area in the second period.
When asked how long it will take for the former Coventry City forward to settle into his new surroundings, Arteta was optimistic.
""I hope days,"" he said with a smile. ""Every day in training I think he is getting a really good feeling.
""He is building connections outside, which is really important with players that are going to help him to get in the position that he needs to get in.
""His fitness level, he hasn't trained with a team for two months. I think he is on five sessions before today. I think on Saturday he will take another step and be in a better condition.""

Burnley sign midfielder Ugochukwu from Chelsea,Burnley complete the signing of midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu from Chelsea for a fee of more than £20m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crm43mzz4zro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 22:06:25",,['Chelsea'],"Burnley have completed the signing of French midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu from Chelsea for a fee of more than £20m.
The 21-year-old has signed a five-year deal at Turf Moor.
BBC Sport understands the fee is similar to the £23.2m Chelsea paid to sign Ugochukwu from Rennes in 2023.
""It's a great feeling to sign for Burnley,"" said Ugochukwu.
""As soon as I was made aware of the club's interest in signing me, I was keen to hear more about the project. I spoke to the manager and Maxime [Esteve] – they were both so passionate about the club and the direction it's heading in.
""It feels like this is the perfect move for me at this stage of my career with the ambition the club is showing.""
Ugochukwu was considered surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea look to sell multiple players in their so-called 'bomb squad' - a group of players including England internationals Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell - training separately from Enzo Maresca's first team.
Ugochukwu spent two years at Chelsea, making 15 appearances in all competitions during his first season before joining Southampton on a season-long loan for 2024-25.
Burnley are also in talks to sign Chelsea's 23-year-old forward Armando Broja.
Sources say the move could be worth up to £20m but the exact price has not been confirmed.

Sunderland sign Chelsea striker Guiu on loan,Sunderland sign teenage Chelsea forward Marc Guiu on loan for the 2025-26 season.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg50qjmq6mlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 19:31:02",Mandeep Sanghera,['Chelsea'],"Sunderland have signed teenage Chelsea forward Marc Guiu on a season-long loan.
The Spaniard, now 19, moved to Stamford Bridge for £5m from Barcelona in July 2024 and scored six goals in 16 matches for the Blues last season.
Describing himself as ""a powerful striker"" and ""natural goalscorer"", Guiu said of his transfer to Sunderland: ""This year is a huge opportunity for me to help take this team where it truly deserves to be, and I can't wait to get started.""
Sunderland earned promotion to the Premier League by beating Sheffield United in the Championship play-off final in May.
Guiu becomes the Black Cats' ninth signing of the summer.
He came through Barcelona's celebrated La Masia academy and scored just 33 seconds into his debut in a 1-0 win against Athletic Bilbao in October 2023.
After moving to England, he scored three goals against Shamrock Rovers in the Conference League last season to become Chelsea's second youngest player to net a hat-trick.
Sunderland sporting director Kristjaan Speakman said: ""In a loan acquisition, we not only have to convince the player but also the parent club, and we thank Chelsea for placing their trust in us.
""Most importantly, Marc wanted to come to Sunderland and be a part of our club. The competition for his signature was significant and he had many high-quality options.
""Marc's a progressive striker who has key attributes that align with the role in our team.""

How are Man Utd able to afford Sesko?,Recent news surrounding Manchester United's finances has not been positive - which will have left fans wondering how they are able to finance a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crr2z1pwjjpo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:19:03",Emma Smith,['Manchester United'],"Whether about a raft of redundancies or free lunches for staff being scrapped, news surrounding Manchester United's finances has not been positive.
Which will have left fans wondering how they are able to fund a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, amid a £200m refurbishment of their attack for next season.
The answer lies in some clever financing of their summer transfers both in and out – and some of the reports of their debt being greatly exaggerated.
""If Manchester United sneeze, football catches a cold,"" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.
""It is the biggest brand in English football. The redundancies do look severe, but that is the Ineos business model, they have done that at other companies. Whether it will work in football, we have to wait and see.""
United sources previously outlined to the BBC's chief football news reporter Simon Stone how it is possible for them to reach an agreement on Sesko, even though co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said earlier this year there was the potential for the club to go bust by Christmas without massive cost-cutting measures.
Payment arrangements totalling £130m for the deals this summer for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, from Wolves and Brentford respectively, have been arranged in a favourable way.
It is likely any deal for Sesko would be arranged similarly, with the payment spread over the length of the player's contract.
In addition, the entirety of Marcus Rashford's £325,000-a-week salary is being covered by his loan move to Barcelona and Manchester United received £5m from Chelsea after the Blues pulled out of a deal to sign Jadon Sancho.
Manchester United have also received more than £15m in payments as part of sell-on clauses involving Anthony Elanga, Alvaro Carreras and Maxi Oyedele.
'Some of the scare stories were overblown'
They also sold academy products Mason Greenwood and Scott McTominay last summer, and will aim to sell several other unwanted or wantaway players before this window closes, including Alejandro Garnacho.
""Even if their signings come to £200m, it is £40m a year and they will recover that by selling players in the 'bomb squad',"" Maguire said.
United also raised money by reaching the Europa League final last season and despite their struggles on the pitch - including a lowest finish in the Premier League era last season - remain a commercial juggernaut.
In June, the club revealed an annual core profit forecast of £180m-£190m, up from an earlier projection of £145m-£160m.
United's bid for Sesko could rise to £73.8m, but includes a guaranteed payment of £65.2m. If this is what they pay for the 22-year-old Slovenian, it will take their overall transfer expenditure this summer to £180m, the third highest in the Premier League, external after Liverpool and Chelsea.
""Some of the scare stories put about a few months ago were perhaps a bit overblown,"" Maguire said.
""Man Utd is not as successful as a business as they would like to be, but they are still successful. For example their wage bill is around half of their income, which is very good by Premier League standards.""
This all comes after Ratcliffe said United came close to running out of cash this year.
""We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans,"" he told the BBC.
'Man Utd are not in as good a position as Liverpool or Chelsea'
Ratcliffe said costs had risen and the club had been spending more than it earned for seven seasons.
""If you spend more than you earn eventually that's the road to ruin,"" he said.
However, he did also say United would look to spend on players in this transfer window.
""Where do you want to spend the money? Do you want to spend it on operating the club, or do you want to spend it on the squad?
""What we want to do is invest in the best players in the world if we can, rather than spend it on, I'm afraid, free lunches.""
Things are not wholly rosy at Old Trafford, however,
If Sesko signs, manager Ruben Amorim will have to sell first to finance any further reinforcements to his squad.
The club lost £131m in the 2023-24 financial year. And while quite a bit of that was interest and the costs of the Ineos takeover, which doesn't count towards PSR, it is still not emblematic of a club in rude health.
""Man Utd can't spend as much as Liverpool and Chelsea,"" said Maguire. ""Of the 'big six', Man Utd are not in as good a position.
""But they are still in a good position. They have the biggest stadium, so the highest matchday revenues, and have one of highest commercial revenues. They are an attractive brand.""

Dewsbury-Hall joins Everton on five-year deal,Everton complete the signing of English midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Chelsea for a fee of about £28m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gq7y9z4y5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:42:52",Alex Brotherton,['Chelsea'],"Everton have completed the signing of midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Chelsea for a fee of about £28m.
The fee for the 26-year-old is an initial £24m, with a further £3-4m due in add-ons.
Dewsbury-Hall has signed a five-year contract with the Toffees until the end of June 2030.
The Leicester City academy graduate is Everton's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Charly Alcaraz, Thierno Barry, Mark Travers and Adam Aznou.
""I'm honestly very excited, my family's excited. There's a real buzz about this. It feels right for me,"" said Dewsbury-Hall.
""So just that alone gives me the motivation and the extra determination to show everybody, to prove a point and have a really successful time here.""
Did Dewsbury-Hall fail at Chelsea?
Dewsbury-Hall adapted well to Maresca's system at Chelsea, but not to playing a bit-part role as Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Enzo Fernandez all featured ahead of him in the midfield pecking order.
Although Dewsbury-Hall started only twice in the Premier League in his sole season at Chelsea, he scored four times in the Uefa Conference League and came off the bench to set up Jadon Sancho's goal in the 4-1 triumph over Real Betis in May's final.
He was used mainly as a substitute in the Fifa Club World Cup, but scored his fifth goal for the club in a 4-1 victory over Benfica and appeared as a substitute in the 3-0 final success over Paris St-Germain.
He was a decent performer when given a chance for the Stamford Bridge side, but became part of a trend of players moving quickly in and then out again.
The sale of Dewsbury-Hall is particularly important as Uefa's recent punishment for financial control violations suggests Chelsea must sell players from their last Conference League squad to ensure a ""positive transfer balance"" this summer.
If not, they can't register new signings like Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens and Liam Delap by September for the Champions League.
A source of goals from midfield?
Everton boss David Moyes has been vocal about his need for fresh faces this summer and the addition of Dewsbury-Hall would add much needed depth and quality to their midfield.
The 26-year-old was an ever-present for Chelsea in their successful Conference League campaign, but ultimately struggled to force his way into the Premier League side.
He made two top-flight starts for the Blues and his total of 13 league appearances amounted to just 256 minutes of playing time.
But it will be Dewsbury-Hall's returns during Leicester's 2023-24 promotion season that will be of particular interest to Moyes as he looks to replace the important attacking contributions of Abdoulaye Doucoure from central areas.
The box-to-box midfielder notched 12 goals and 14 assists for the Foxes as they won the second-tier title and that tally has only been bettered three times in the last 10 Championship seasons.

Premier League 2025-26 preview No 7: Chelsea,Club World Cup triumph has transformed ambitions but departures will be needed to balance books and fund more signings,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/07/premier-league-2025-26-preview-no-7-chelsea,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 23:01:18",Michael Butler,['Chelsea'],"Guardian writers’ predicted position: 4th (NB: this is not necessarily Michael Butler’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)
Last season’s position: 4th
Prospects
Securing Champions League qualification on the last day of the Premier League season and an unlikely Club World Cup triumph have transformed the club, their finances and ambitions for 2025-26. Chelsea stayed relatively under the radar for much of the Club World Cup – in part because of their relatively kind route to the later stages – but their commanding 3-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germain in the final means they are again regarded as a potentially dominant European force and perhaps even as contenders for the Premier League title.
That is if Chelsea are ready – mentally, physically and tactically – for the new season. By the time Chelsea played the Club World Cup final on 13 July, nearly every other Premier League side had started their pre-season. Since then, while Liverpool, Arsenal and co have been hard at work, the players have had three weeks off and returned on Monday, with two friendly matches, two days apart, scheduled before their Premier League opener against Crystal Palace on 17 August. To say Chelsea are playing catch-up is a severe understatement.
That said, this is probably the most exciting period for Chelsea since the Champions League triumph in 2021. With the exception of goalkeeper and possibly centre-back, Enzo Maresca has a claim to having two elite players in every position and he could yet add further depth with Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho heavily linked. Departures will be needed to trim the fat and balance the books – Chelsea were given a €31m (£27m) fine last month by Uefa for breaking financial rules – but few would argue against them having the deepest squad in the league and one of Maresca’s biggest challenges will be maintaining harmony and continuity, on and off the pitch. Last season, the Conference League was a useful chance to rest and rotate players. The Champions League will not be so accommodating.
The manager
As recently as April, Maresca was at odds with the Chelsea fans and appeared to blame a negative environment at Stamford Bridge for a 2-2 home draw with Ipswich that left top-five hopes fading fast. But five wins from the final six league games secured fourth place, saving Chelsea’s season and possibly Maresca’s job. “They were saying that we are too young, we are not good enough,” he said. “Unfortunately for them, they have all been wrong. So in English, how do you say? Eff-off to all of them.” Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph – and the tactical masterclass by Maresca in the final to neutralise PSG’s front three and create pockets of space for Cole Palmer – means he will get a very different reception at Stamford Bridge for Chelsea’s league opener.
Off-field picture
Chelsea’s much-maligned financial gymnastics of recent years – the eight-year contract amortisation (a loophole closed by Uefa), the sale of their hugely successful women’s team (to their own parent company) and their rampant use of multiclub ownership and the loan system – have infuriated rivals and allowed them to assemble one of the deepest, youngest, most talented squads around. In the Todd Boehly era, Chelsea have spent more than £1.5bn and the club face an additional €60m fine from Uefa if they fail to comply with regulations over the next four years. A bigger stadium would help, but what Chelsea do with Stamford Bridge remains unclear; the 40,044-capacity ground is not easily developed given challenges ranging from the freehold to a nearby railway line. A move to Earl’s Court has been mooted.
Star signing
Estêvão was courted by PSG, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich and is widely regarded as the biggest talent to come out of Brazil since Vinícius Júnior. The 18-year-old’s performances at the Club World Cup – including a brilliant strike for Palmeiras against Chelsea in the quarter-final – suggests that the summer arrival is already world class. Players swooned over the teenager at the final whistle in Philadelphia – “I told Estêvão: ‘We are excited for you to join’ but he didn’t understand a single word I said,” Palmer said after swapping shirts with the £52m signing. Capable off both wings or as a No 10, the slender Estêvão will want to impress the former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, now of Brazil, before the World Cup next summer.
Stepping up
“He potentially can be a top defender for this club,” Maresca said of Josh Acheampong after the defender’s performances at the Club World Cup prompted whispers that several clubs in England and Europe were tracking the teenager. How the 19-year-old fits into Maresca’s plans remains to be seen, but his versatility, 6ft 3in stature and composure enabled him to enjoy a breakthrough year with 13 first-team appearances. Naturally a right-back or a centre-back but capable of playing anywhere across the backline, Acheampong joined Chelsea as an under-eight and signed a new five-year contract in 2024. “The clubs that were mentioned, they like Josh, but we also like Josh,” Maresca said. “The best plan for Josh is to be with us.”
A big season for …
Roméo Lavia. The 21-year-old’s quality is not in question. Chelsea are a better side with Lavia, more fluid and press-resistant, and he was sensational in a 3-1 win against Liverpool in May when he completed 100% of his passes. Maresca even moved Moisés Caicedo to right-back to accommodate Lavia alongside Enzo Fernández at the back end of last season, but concerns remain over the Belgian’s fitness. After a first year when he managed 32 minutes in 2023-24, another injury-hit campaign followed, starting 11 league games. Another year on the sidelines could spell trouble, particularly as Chelsea have Caicedo, Fernández, Dário Essugo, the impressive Andrey Santos and perhaps Reece James competing for two spots in defensive midfield in Maresca’s preferred 4-2-3-1 formation.

Football transfer rumours: Baleba to Manchester United?

They have passed the time by trying to find out just how much it would cost to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton. Ruben Amorim needs an extra central midfielder who can actually run around a bit and the Cameroonian would be ideal but the Seagulls are not keen on selling.
Across Manchester, it’s about trying to get rid of a few as Pep Guardiola wants to trim his squad. Jack Grealish does not look like he will get much in the way of minutes at City this season and will seek opportunities elsewhere. Everton have made contact with City as the seek a season-long loan but are a bit worried about how much the winger is actually on because they will not be able to pay the full lot.
One person not heading out the Etihad Stadium exit door is Mateo Kovacic. Saudi Premier League clubs have expressed interest in the Croatia midfielder but it is just not the move for the 31-year-old who would rather stay in the Premier League.
Having missed out on every man and his dog this summer, Newcastle have their eyes firmly fixed on the next person to turn them down. He goes by the name John McGinn and he currently plays for Aston Villa. Everton previously made enquiries about the Scotland midfielder but nothing was doing.
Nottingham Forest are the latest club to find that Ipswich are not particularly eager to let Omari Hutchinson go. Brentford tried to steal him away earlier in the summer and now Evangelos Marinakis has offered a massive wad adding up to £35m, only to be told that is not enough and been sent on his way. A more likely move involving Forest and a winger could see Jota Silva leave the club and return to Portugal with Sporting. The Tricky Trees want double the £5.9m they paid for him 12 months ago.
The world may need to get used to two Idrissa Gueyes in the Premier League because West Ham are stepping up their interest in the Metz teenage prodigy who shares a name with the Everton man. The French club want £13m for the forward, who has also attracted interest from Manchester United and Brentford.
José Mourinho is eyeing a £13m for the Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma, who is tempted by a move to Fenerbahce. West Ham and Juventus could, however, provide competition for his signature.
One midfielder wanting to leave Turkey is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. The midfielder looks set to be released by Besiktas soon enough and that has alerted English clubs to his availability. Leeds might fancy securing the services of the former England International for absolutely nothing.

Viktor Gyökeres labours as Arsenal fall short against Villarreal and Pépé,"The £64m man made his home debut in a friendly, with Mikel Arteta saying the forward will be ‘in a very good position’ on Saturday",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/viktor-gyokeres-arsenal-villarreal,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 19:58:45",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"New season, same old Arsenal? On an evening when Viktor Gyökeres was meant to announce himself as the solution to all of Mikel Arteta’s problems, instead it was a figure from Arsenal’s past who stole the show.
At £72m – £8m more than they may end up paying for the Sweden striker – Nicolas Pépé was an expensive Arsenal signing, a few months before Arteta replaced Unai Emery in 2019. Most of the fans who packed out the Emirates Stadium for this pre-season friendly will not have many fond memories of the Ivory Coast international’s spell in north London, but he clearly had a point to prove here.
Pépé’s early goal and strikes from Karl Etta Eyong and the former Tottenham loanee Arnaut Danjuma sealed an impressive win for Villarreal, and left Arteta with plenty of questions to resolve before Arsenal’s opening game of the season next weekend against Manchester United.
Gyökeres, who is the headline act of a spending spree that could exceed £200m, looked short of match fitness as he toiled up front for 62 minutes. Only the introduction of the 15‑year‑old Max Dowman for his first senior appearance at the Emirates Stadium could lift the mood as he won a penalty that allowed Martin Ødegaard to make the scoreline more respectable. But there were more reasons to be fearful for Arsenal’s fans as they aim to improve on finishing as Premier League runners-up for a third successive season.
There had been a sense of anticipation in the late summer air as they queued patiently at the club shop before kick‑off, with several already sporting Gyökeres’s new replica No 14 shirt. Having made his debut last week as a substitute against Spurs in their 1-0 defeat in Hong Kong, the Sweden striker is still playing catch‑up having stayed away from pre-season with Sporting as he attempted to force through his move. But he was included in a strong starting lineup, with Ethan Nwaneri deputising for Ødegaard alongside the new signing Christian Nørgaard and Mikel Merino in midfield.
The match programme featured pictures of all six of Arsenal’s summer arrivals on the cover, with Martín Zubimendi, Cristhian Mosquera, Noni Madueke and Kepa Arrizabalaga on the bench. Arteta used his programme notes to express his belief they “will add quality and depth to the squad, which is what we are going to need throughout the season”.
Arteta added: “We know what our targets are and what we want to achieve this season – there is a big belief in our ability to achieve that. We have been very, very close the last few seasons and the whole team is going to determine whether we achieve that or not.”
It was Nwaneri, who has signed a new contract this summer, who caught the eye early on. A cross from Merino that was meant for the forehead of Gyökeres instead found Bukayo Saka at the back post and he could not direct the ball on target. But with only Gabriel Magalhães missing from his first-choice back four, Arteta will be concerned with how easily Villarreal established a 2-0 lead.
Pépé, who joined Villarreal last year on a free transfer and is set to be joined by the former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey after he agreed an initial one-year deal, was unlucky when his shot came back off the post before he eventually forced the ball past David Raya when Arsenal failed to clear. The Spaniard was left fuming with his defence when Etta Eyong doubled the Spanish side’s lead just after the half-hour, although Nørgaard immediately pulled one back from a corner.
Like last season when they struggled from a lack of creativity, that seemed to be Arsenal’s best chance of scoring as Gyökeres was forced to live off scraps before the break. Mosquera and Zubimendi were summoned for the second half and there was an immediate improvement. Gyökeres finally had a sight of goal when played in by Merino but his shot was well saved by Luiz Júnior.
It needed Dowman, who has been hailed as a “special talent” by Arteta despite his tender years, to save some face after Danjuma had raced clear to make it 3-1, although Madueke missed the decisive penalty in a post‑match shootout.
“Max is moving so fast – even last year when he was training with us, he was doing these kind of things and now he is doing them in the games,” Arteta said. “The efficiency he shows in every attacking action is incredible and he deserves more chances.”
On Gyökeres, Arteta said: “Every day in training he is getting a really good feeling and connection with all the other players who are going to help him. He hasn’t trained for a team for two months and, on Saturday, he will take another step and be in a very good position.”

Villarreal fans decry Thomas Partey’s proposed signing as club’s ‘darkest day’,Midfielder has denied rape and sexual assault charges,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/villarreal-fans-react-thomas-partey,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:20:27",Ashifa Kassam,['Arsenal'],"News that the former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey is poised to join Villarreal has upset fans of the Spanish club, with hundreds signing a petition urging a halt to what has been described as the “darkest day in the club’s history”.
Partey appeared in a London court on Tuesday, charged with five counts of rape relating to two women and a charge of sexual assault against a third woman. The alleged offences are said to have taken place in 2021 and 2022 when Partey was playing for Arsenal.
Partey was granted conditional bail on Tuesday and the chief magistrate said he understood that the 32‑year‑old would soon be moving to Spain. Villarreal have agreed to sign the Ghana international on a one-year contract with an option to extend by 12 months.
Rahul Lakhani, a football journalist and La Liga expert behind the La Liga London account, said: “It’s rocked the community. I’ve had people in my social media responding quite aggressively to me, saying he’s innocent until he’s proven guilty. But the overarching reaction is that Villarreal fans don’t want their names associated with him.”
On social media scores of fans have voiced their opposition to the move, using a hashtag that translates to “No to Thomas Partey”. Others have passed around contact details for the club’s official channels, urging people to complain.
As Arsenal gear up to host Villarreal in a friendly on Wednesday, Lakhani described Partey’s potential signing as a stain on Villarreal, a club deeply intertwined with its home town of 52,000. “They’re seen as someone who isn’t like Real Madrid or Barcelona or the [Premier League’s] Big Six,” he said. “They’re the antithesis of that. They’re a club that has helped their community a lot, they’re seen as a family-run club.”
Partey’s arrival would probably alter this image, Lakhani said. “Their name is now going to be associated with wanting to sign someone who has five [rape] charges over his head, rather than being known as a club that plays good football or punches above their weight.”
More than 800 people have signed a petition that describes the move as a “slap in the face” to the club’s supporters and “all victims of sexual abuse worldwide”. The petition was launched by the online content hub Villarreal Report, which said this week that the signing would be “an act of pure betrayal of the highest order” against the club’s supporters and Villarreal’s values. “The darkest day in the club’s history is drawing closer by the second,” it said on social media.
Villarreal did not respond to a request for comment.
As Partey’s contract with Arsenal neared its expiry date, the club confirmed they were in talks over a new contract. After they failed to agree a new deal, it emerged that Partey, who has played for Atlético Madrid, Mallorca and Almería, was heading to Spain. He was charged not long after he left Arsenal, after an investigation that began in 2022.
Partey’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, has said previously that he “denies all the charges against him” and that he welcomed “the opportunity to finally clear his name”.
Some Villarreal fans have embraced the prospective signing, hinting at the deep divisions sown by Partey’s expected arrival. “It’s a top signing, it’s great for the team,” said Borja Jiménez Ortega, who heads the L’Os Groc supporters club in Madrid. “I have a lot of confidence in the club.” The view was widely shared among the 60 members of his fans group, he said. “There’s just two or three who don’t want him.”
Others pointed to the wider message. “I’m against this signing,” said César Márquez Trabado, the president of the supporters club Peña Amarilla Villafranca de los Barros. “It’s true he would fit in very well at Villarreal because he’s a player of tremendous quality, but I believe there are ethical limits that should not be crossed, even if the player has not been convicted of the charges against him.”
It was a view shared by many, he said. “I would say 90% of fans are against this. Because in the end, the team may improve in the short term. But in the long term, this will do a lot of damage to our image.”

Everton seal £28m deal for Chelsea midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall,Five-year contract for club’s fifth summer signing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/everton-chelsea-kiernan-dewsbury-hall-transfer-window,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:43:58",Andy Hunter,['Chelsea'],"Everton have completed the signing of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Chelsea for a fee that could rise to £28m. The midfielder followed manager Enzo Maresca from Leicester to Chelsea last summer for £30m but was unable to secure regular Premier League football at Stamford Bridge.
The 26-year-old started 14 of Chelsea’s 15 games in their triumphant Europa Conference League campaign, scoring four goals and providing three assists. He also made five appearances at the Club World Cup won by Chelsea.
Dewsbury-Hall has signed a five-year contract with Everton, who will pay a guaranteed £25m plus £3m in add-ons.
“For me to leave my old club, it would have had to have been for something special, a project I really believed in,” Dewsbury-Hall said. “After speaking to the manager and seeing the ambitions with the new stadium and everything, it felt like the right club, it felt like the right fit for me for the next step.
“[David Moyes] said he’s been admiring me for a while; he loves the way I play and just explained to me what he sees me doing in my role in this team. That’s what you want to hear as a player.
“I have enormous respect for him, he’s a legend of the game, so it’ll be a pleasure to work under him.”
Dewsbury-Hall is Everton’s fifth signing of the summer but attempts to add Tyler Dibling to the squad look likely to be frustrated. Everton have made three offers for the 19-year-old, the latest worth about £40m, but talks are at an impasse with Southampton holding out for more.
Everton also have an interest in Jack Grealish, but have not opened talks with Manchester City over the England international. A season’s loan fee for Grealish could cost £12m and Moyes has other priorities, including a right-winger.

Oasis-style ticketing and expendable fans: the battle to retain football’s soul,"With protests planned for the start of the season, the FSA chair believes only fan consultation will help address grievances",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/oasis-style-ticketing-expendable-fans-battle-to-retain-football-soul,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 19:00:12",Paul MacInnes,"['Manchester United', 'Liverpool', 'Manchester City']","“I’m a bit younger, so this is all I’ve known,” says Nick Clarke, “but something that defines this moment is the feeling that it’s our last chance. You know that phrase: ‘The game’s gone’? I think the game is genuinely going away. It’s excluding traditional supporters and the communities that built the clubs in the first place.”
Clarke has just celebrated his 30th birthday and is coming off the back of a big season. As one of the four season-ticket holders behind the MCFC Fans Foodbank Support, Clarke has been active among the Manchester City fanbase and in the community since the pandemic. With the growing concern over the pricing and provision of tickets at his club last year, he helped coordinate protests by fans whose rivalries go back generations, but whose problems are increasingly shared. Supporters of Everton, Liverpool and Manchester United and others joined City fans under the banner “Stop Exploiting Loyalty” and in doing so became part of a new wave of supporter activism.
“I know there’s all these things about multi-club ownership, private and state ownership, playing games abroad, accusations of killing the soul of the game,” Clarke says. “But, really, what is the game? It’s the communities that go to it, it’s the communities that have made the clubs who they are, going back four, five, six generations till their very inception.
“The wider football supporter community are only just now cottoning on that we have so much more in common and if we don’t stand together the game is going to be gone before we know it. That’s all we have to do and all we can do. We just need to really keep up that momentum.”
It already seems there will be reason for fans to take a stand once more this season. It is not the first time they will have come together to demand change, but for those with clubs at the top of the pyramid there is a sense the ground is shifting and the needs of fans is becoming an afterthought, if not an outright problem.
At the heart is a concern that clubs want to move away from having matches filled with season-ticket holders towards something more casual, and more lucrative. Imagine every Premier League fixture becoming more like an Oasis gig, for ever.
“The problems are different at different levels of the game,” says Tom Greatrex, the new chair of the Football Supporters’ Association, who drove the Stop Exploiting Loyalty campaign. “In the Premier League, and at the top of the Championship, Stop Exploiting Loyalty has helped to bring to the fore a set of issues that have been developing over a period of time.
“We are seeing that parts of clubs’ fanbases, which have traditionally been loyal and go home and away, are now almost expendable to not all, but many of the people that currently run a number of those clubs. It’s gone beyond exploitation to expendability.”
Fans are suffering rises in ticket prices, the lowering or ending of ticket concessions and initiatives that require season-ticket holders to attend a certain number of games each season or risk losing their place, as examples of this trend. According to Greatrex, the effects are being felt in some grounds.
“The number of people who are there almost to experience something which they’re not necessarily part of has tipped into a significant proportion to the extent that it undermines the thing they’re going there to experience,” he says. “There is a real danger that in a short-term push for increased revenue from matchday tickets and associated spend that clubs are in danger of actually undermining the whole ‘product’ they’re so proud of.”
One topic that crystallises the anxiety over expendability is that of matches being selected for TV. There will be more televised games than ever this season, with Sky showing a minimum 215 Premier League fixtures. With each televised match comes possible rescheduling and a potentially challenging (or even impossible) journey for fans.
“There can be very very short-notice changes, which make it very difficult for people to be able to attend those matches. I don’t think there’s been enough focus on things that could be done to mitigate some of the frustration that comes from those changes.” The FSA has called for a 12-week notice period on fixture rearrangements, the provision of more “football special” trains and the extension of the £30 cap on away tickets into the EFL.
The Premier League has committed to giving six weeks’ notice of fixture adjustments on all matches until January, but last month had to apologise after failing to meet its own deadline of announcing all September adjustments by 9 July.
It is striking that the mood among fans is so febrile at the time the government has passed legislation designed, in part, to give supporters more influence over their clubs. Fan consultation is a central requirement of the new Independent Football Regulator for the English men’s elite game and legislation is, in part, the result of long-term campaigning by the FSA.
It is not a panacea and its influence is unlikely to take hold for some seasons yet, but Greatrex, a former Labour MP, believes it can form a platform for better understanding between fans, clubs and competitions. “More than ever, there is an appreciation – among some, it’s reluctant, but among others, it’s embraced – that supporters have a legitimate voice that deserves to be heard and their views to be considered,” he says.
“[The regulator] is actually the basis for a much more constructive approach, which means that if clubs are sensible you can prevent a lot of the flashpoints getting to the point at which they become high profile, because you’ve dealt with it sensibly ahead of that time.”
Clarke would much rather have dialogue than protest. “I don’t want to be doing another protest all my life,” he says. “I know there’s no easy answers but a lot of this protest energy has come because people feel they’re not being listened to. That’s where the anger comes from.”

Manchester United confident of beating Newcastle to signing Benjamin Sesko,Sesko wants Old Trafford despite no Champions League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/manchester-united-confident-of-beating-newcastle-to-benjamin-sesko-signing,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:16:51",Will Unwin,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United are increasingly confident of signing Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig on a deal that could rise to £74.1m after the striker indicated his preference to join the club
Newcastle are interested in the Slovenia international, but Sesko favours a move to Old Trafford, where he is due to sign a five-year deal, even though Newcastle offer Champions League football. United have offered £65.4m upfront and the remainder in add-ons.
After completing deals for Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego León, Ruben Amorim has focused on securing a No 9 after United scored 44 goals in 38 Premier League games last season. They missed out on Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea, and Hugo Ekitiké, after he moved to Liverpool from Eintracht Frankfurt. Ollie Watkins was another target, but United were put off by Aston Villa’s £60m valuation.
Sesko scored 13 times in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season and got a further four goals in the Champions League.
His arrival would take United’s summer spend to about £214m and leave them to concentrate on sales. Marcus Rashford has departed on loan for Barcelona, who will pay all of the forward’s wages, but no deals have been sealed for Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. None of the four have been part of Amorim’s pre-season plans and were allowed extra time away from the club to seek an exit.
Sesko’s arrival would create further uncertainty about Rasmus Højlund’s future. The Dane has struggled leading the line since joining for £72m from Atalanta and has been made available, but United would also consider loaning him if a club are willing to cover his wages and pay a fee.

Chelsea step up efforts to sign Garnacho and Simons in attacking reshuffle,Newcastle eyeing Nicolas Jackson after Sesko blow,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/transfer-news-chelsea-alejandro-garnacho-xavi-simons-nicolas-jackson-manchester-united-rb-leipzig,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:10:23",Ed Aarons,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","Chelsea are to step up attempts to sign Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United and Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig and could sell Nicolas Jackson, as they continue to reshape their attacking options.
The club have brought in Liam Delap, João Pedro and Jamie Gittens, and moves for Garnacho and Simons are understood to be their priority.
Garnacho has played no part in United’s pre-season and is thought to be available for about £50m, although Chelsea are understood to be reluctant to pay that. The Argentina forward is believed to be keen to move to Stamford Bridge after Ruben Amorim made clear the 21-year-old is not part of his plans at Old Trafford.
Chelsea have yet to make an official approach but are likely to do so, with United seeking to balance their books as they close on the signing of Benjamin Sesko from Leipzig. Chelsea are in talks with the German club over Simons, who is understood to have agreed personal terms despite interest from Bayern Munich.
The 22-year-old, who can play in several attacking roles, joined Leipzig from Paris Saint-Germain in January for €50m after two successful loan spells. He is expected to cost about €70m (£61m) and Leipzig are targeting Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott as a potential replacement.
Jackson is understood to prefer to stay at Chelsea despite the arrivals of Delap and Pedro dropping him down the pecking order, but Chelsea are believed to be willing to sell the Senegal striker for the right price. Newcastle could be an option if, as expected, they miss out on Sesko, and Jackson also has interest from Milan and other Italian clubs but Chelsea could demand £80m.
Chelsea’s 19-year-old Spanish striker Marc Guiu is poised to join Sunderland on loan having completed his medical on Wednesday, and Everton have completed the £28m signing of the midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury‑Hall on a five-year contract. Burnley are closing in on signing Armando Broja for £20m and are likely to pay a similar fee for Lesley Ugochukwu. Borussia Dortmund are also in talks with Chelsea over a permanent deal for Carney Chukwuemeka, who spent part of last season on loan in Germany.
Chelsea have sold Kepa Arrizabalaga, Noni Madueke, Djordje Petrovic and João Félix for combined fees that could reach well above £100m. They are also hoping to offload Raheem Sterling, who spent last season on loan at Arsenal and has been linked with clubs in Turkey, together with Axel Disasi, Renato Veiga, Christopher Nkunku and Ben Chilwell.
The Netherlands defender Jorrel Hato became Chelsea’s latest summer signing when his £37m move from Ajax was confirmed on Sunday.

Liverpool grant Darwin Núñez go-ahead for move to Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal,Deal for the 26-year-old forward is expected soon,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/liverpool-grant-darwin-nunez-go-ahead-for-move-to-saudi-arabia-al-hilal,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:13:51",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have given Darwin Núñez permission to negotiate a move to the Saudi Pro League, with Al‑Hilal close to finalising a fee for the Uruguay international. They remain in discussion over a deal for the 26-year-old, who started eight Premier League games last season, but an agreement is expected to be reached quickly providing Núñez is open to the transfer.
Milan and Napoli were interested in taking the centre-forward, but were deterred by the finances involved. Liverpool paid an initial £64m to sign Núñez from Benfica in 2022, with add-ons taking the deal to a potential club-record £85m at the time, and have been looking to recoup about £60m.
The Premier League champions rejected a bid of about £60m from Al‑Nassr in January as they prioritised winning the title over cashing in on a player who has struggled to adapt to Arne Slot’s system. Al‑Hilal’s offer is for an initial £46m, plus add‑ons, although the final structure has yet to be agreed.
Núñez would be a statement signing for Al-Hilal, as a high‑profile forward in the prime of his career. The squad are at a training camp in Germany and Núñez could meet Al‑Hilal officials there. He will remain part of plans for the Community Shield against Crystal Palace on Sunday if he is not sold.
A deal for Núñez would take Liverpool’s income from player sales past £250m since Richard Hughes started as sporting director last summer. The club sold Tyler Morton to Lyon for £15m on Tuesday and could also sell Harvey Elliott and Federico Chiesa. Leipzig are considering a move for Elliott should Xavi Simons join Chelsea and Chiesa could return to Italy.
Liverpool have invested almost £300m on players this summer and their £110m bid for the Newcastle striker Alexander Isak remains on the table.

‘Dream come true’: Son Heung-min officially joins Los Angeles FC in MLS record deal,Forward watched LAFC’s home game against Tigres,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/son-heung-min-los-angeles-sign-spurs-lafc,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 08:36:45",Guardian sport,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Son Heung-min has arrived at Los Angeles FC with great excitement and even greater ambitions for the next stage of his groundbreaking soccer career.
“I’m here to win, and I will perform,” Son said at a packed news conference. “I will definitely show you something exciting ... are we calling it football or soccer? I will definitely show some exciting football, and we definitely will have success.”
LAFC formally introduced their new forward Wednesday at BMO Stadium, where his likeness already looms over the main entrance gates and on video boards surrounding the stadium. The 33-year-old South Korean superstar is back on the Pacific Rim after a professional career spent in Europe, including the past decade at Tottenham.
“What can I say? Dream come true. LA, what a city,” said Son, who will wear No 7 in black and gold.
Son joined Los Angeles FC for a record Major League Soccer transfer fee, ending his lengthy stint at the Premier League club. Financial details of the transfer were not disclosed by either club but the Athletic reported LAFC paid a fee in the region of $26.5m.
Son had suitors from around the globe after he decided to leave Spurs, and he said the decision to join LAFC initially wasn’t obvious. He came around to the idea of moving to MLS after conversations with LAFC general manager John Thorrington, who sold Son on the eight-year-old club’s ambition to be an international brand and the most successful club in North America.
“If I’m honest, it was not my first choice,” Son said. “But [from the] first call when I talked to John after the season finished, he just changed my mind. He changed my heart. He changed my brain. He showed me the destination where I should be. Right now, I’m here. I’m more than happy.”
Son laughingly said he was also pitched aggressively by Hugo Lloris, his longtime teammate at Tottenham who is now LAFC’s starting goalkeeper.
Son is South Korea’s most popular athlete, and he is widely considered to be the greatest Asian soccer player in history. He said he already feels at home in Los Angeles, which has the world’s largest ethnic Korean population outside Korea and a robust base of soccer fans from all backgrounds who appreciate his accomplishments.
Son’s introductory news conference was attended by Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass, South Korea’s consul general, several additional politicians, dozens of Korean journalists and dozens of drum-beating, singing fans from the LAFC supporters’ group famous for its relentless, raucous noise during matches. Son already got a taste of LAFC fans’ passion Tuesday when he attended the club’s Leagues Cup victory over Tigres.
“On behalf of millions of Angelenos and soccer fans around the world – Sonny, welcome to Los Angeles,” Bass said. “This is a moment that will be remembered in the city for generations to come.”
Son joins a lengthy list of soccer stars from European leagues who moved to Hollywood for a second act in their careers. Gareth Bale, Giorgio Chiellini and Olivier Giroud have all suited up for LAFC, while the crosstown rival LA Galaxy have welcomed even more European superstars, including David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Robbie Keane and Marco Reus.
Son did not appear to be in decline during the past season as Tottenham’s captain, and he said he is in good game shape after participating in Spurs’ summer tour of Asia. He did not set a date for his LAFC debut, but it could be this month.
“I just felt like I need a new chapter, I need a new challenge, and I choose LAFC,” Son said. “I think we can say I’m old, but I still have a good physicality, good legs, and still have a good quality. I’m here to perform, but also I want to give some advice to the young players for improvement. That’s why we are here.”
