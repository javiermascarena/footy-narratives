Liverpool submit £69m plus add-ons offer for Ekitike,Liverpool have made an offer of &#8364;80m (&#163;69m) plus add-ons for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13398383/hugo-ekitike-transfer-news-liverpool-submit-69m-offer-for-eintracht-frankfurt-forward,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 21:40:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have made an offer of €80m (£69m) plus add-ons for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike.
Sky Sports News understands the total package in this offer could rise to €90m, which is around £78m, but talks continue over the structure of the add-ons.
It comes after 48 hours of negotiations between the two parties, after Liverpool's interest was made public earlier this week.
Ekitike is open to a Premier League move and Liverpool would be his preferred destination, after Newcastle had an offer rejected earlier this week.
Frankfurt are yet to respond to this latest move. Talks continue but so far negotiations between the two have been positive and progressive.
The 23-year-old was an unused substitute during his side's pre-season game against FSV Frankfurt on Saturday. After the game, Frankfurt boss, quoted by Sky Germany, said Ekitike's potential departure is ""a bitter loss"".
Ekitike scored 22 goals in 48 games across all competitions last season for Frankfurt as he helped them qualify for the Champions League.
Sky Sports' Adam Bate:
When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.
""These were players with similar profiles from teams that were better than our team, but not at the distance Paris Saint-Germain were from us,"" Oscar Garcia, Reims' then head coach, told Sky Sports. ""We challenged him to reach the level of the other two strikers.""
On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.
He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. ""Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.""
It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League.
""He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,"" concedes Oscar. ""They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.""

Barcelona close to agreement over Rashford loan - with key detail,Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is closing in on a loan move to Barcelona that could become permanent.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13398831/marcus-rashford-transfer-man-utd-and-barcelona-close-to-agreement-over-initial-loan-move-for-forward,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 14:19:00",Dharmesh Sheth,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is closing in on a loan move to Barcelona that could become permanent.
There is a broad agreement in principle between the clubs for the 27-year-old.
The deal under discussion would give Barcelona the option to buy Rashford at the end of the season and the talks have centred around what that fee would be.
Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan.
The England international has publicly said he would like to play for Barcelona this summer and was interested in a move to the Catalan club in January before joining Aston Villa on loan.
Asked by a Spanish influencer if he would like to play alongside Lamine Yamal, Rashford said: ""Yes, for sure. Everyone wants to play with the best. Hopefully... we'll see.""
Rashford's potential move is understood to have been given the green light by head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.
It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.
Rashford will still have two years left on his United deal when this proposed loan move ends.
The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.
Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.
Teddy Sheringham does not believe Manchester United forward Rashford deserves to join Barcelona after what he feels has been a ""soul-destroying"" episode.
""If you assess where Marcus Rashford is at as a professional footballer, you strive as a youngster to get to the very top and play for clubs like Manchester United, and when you're there, you appreciate it,"" the ex-United player told Sky Bet. ""You don't throw it away and say you want to leave.
""I find the whole episode very soul-destroying, compared to the way I was back in the day and how I strove to get the privilege to play for such a huge football club.
""To hear someone talking the way he is talking, saying he wants out - I didn't like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doing that at Arsenal, I thought it was soul-destroying, and I hope Rashford doesn't get the move that he's hankering for.
""From my perspective, if you go from Manchester United to Barcelona, that's a step up that he hasn't deserved.""

Frank era at Tottenham begins with pre-season win at Reading,Thomas Frank made the perfect start to life as Tottenham head coach as his side beat Reading 2-0 in his first game in charge.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13397495/reading-0-2-tottenham-thomas-frank-era-begins-with-a-win-as-will-lankshear-and-luka-vuskovic-score,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 17:10:00",Dan Long,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Thomas Frank made the perfect start to life as Tottenham head coach as his side beat Reading 2-0 in his first game in charge.
A tepid first half at the Select Car Leasing Stadium made way for a more competitive second, with goals from Will Lankshear and summer signing Luka Vuskovic sealing victory against the Sky Bet League One side.
Mohammed Kudus - a £55m signing from West Ham last week - was introduced after the break and made a brilliant impact, with a hand in both goals.
The first half had a distinctly pre-season feel to it. Spurs had almost 70 per cent possession and Reading were largely chasing shadows, though they did well to protect Joel Pereira's goal.
There were chances for the visitors; Dominic Solanke dangled a leg to meet a cross, which ended up with the ball on the roof of the net, before Pereira made a smart stop to deny Pape Matar Sarr at point-blank range, then punched a Mikey Moore shot that looked destined for the top-right behind.
Frank completely changed his team at the break, with Heung-min Son, Micky van de Ven and Kudus among those to join the action.
In his first press conference on Friday, the Dane had suggested he wanted to play an attacking brand of football, and that soon came to the fore.
There was significantly more purpose to their play in the second half, which resulted in the opener after 49 minutes, when Kudus' corner was flicked on by Vuskovic to Lankshear, who headed past Joel Pereira.
Inside four minutes, it was two. Djed Spence moved the ball on to Kudus, who teed up Vuskovic to clinically sweep home.
Reading acquitted themselves well and had chances to get on the scoresheet, most notably in the final 10 minutes, when Guglielmo Vicario tipped a Ben Elliott shot over the bar, before denying Ashqar Ahmed with almost the final kick of the game.
Tottenham's Luka Vuskovic spoke on the club's official social channels about getting a goal, an assist and a clean sheet on his first game in a Spurs shirt.
""I'm very happy for those stats and I'm happy that we won the game with a clean sheet. We just need to continue to build,"" he said.
""It was a good game; a lot of duels, transitions and I think we managed it well.
""Kudus gave me a top assist and I just put it in the net!
""To have Vicario behind me, Van de Ven beside me was a really amazing experience.
""Now everything is perfect. The club is behind me, the players, the staff, the coach. Everyone is helping me a lot and I'm really happy.""
Sky Sports' Dan Long at the Select Car Leasing Stadium:
The game at Reading was Tottenham's opening pre-season friendly of 2025/26. In the grand scheme of things, it means very little. This period is about fitness and getting a new message across; winning was a bonus, but one Thomas Frank will have been happy to receive.
In his first press conference on Friday, he clearly outlined his vision for the club.
""I'm very clear on the principles on every phase of the game. I want us to be brave and very aggressive. I also want to attack,"" he said.
""Brave is absolutely linked [with] 'To dare is to do'. If you are not brave, it is difficult to achieve anything. Brave is crucial. The aggressivity is crucial if you want to win or achieve something. And you need to attack.""
That was certainly on show in the second half in Berkshire. There was bite about Spurs' attack - and they seized their chances when they came.
Their dominance of the ball was eye-catching. Perhaps it was to be expected against a team two divisions lower, but 65 per cent possession overall was impressive. It was also considerably higher than the 54.8 per cent they averaged in the Premier League under Ange Postecoglou last term.
Then there were the set-pieces. Spurs were practising them before kick-off and scored the opener from one. Brentford liked to get the edge during his time there and were one of the first clubs to employ a set-piece coach. Frank knows they could be valuable to Tottenham.
But this is just game one of many. Frank has four games in four countries over the next few weeks to hone his ideas further and bring them to life before the big kick-off on August 16.

Man Utd new boy Leon catches eye in draw with Leeds,Young full-back Diego Leon impresses during Manchester United's 0-0 draw with Leeds in their pre-season friendly.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c994dnn013ro,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 15:31:17",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Whisper it quietly but Manchester United may have found a little gem in young full-back Diego Leon.
The club had made some pretty significant decisions around the 18-year-old - which indicated the recruitment department believed he had a bright future - even before they opened their pre-season campaign with a 0-0 draw against newly promoted Leeds.
For a start, they invested to bring the Paraguay Under-20 international over from South America.
They then gave him a prized first-team shirt - number 30 - and let highly rated English youngster Harry Amass leave on loan rather than let him compete with Leon for what is presumed to be the back-up left wing-back slot.
Head coach Ruben Amorim opted to start Leon against Leeds in Stockholm, with Matheus Cunha - a summer signing from Wolves - also appearing in a Manchester United shirt for the first time.
And there were little signs that, with the right work ethic, a willingness to listen and enough motivation, Leon could be a very useful asset.
The highlight came at the back end of the first half. A short pass to Chido Obi inside the penalty area was delivered with a delicate touch you would not normally expect of someone Leon's size.
Goodness knows what he was like as a schoolboy in South America, but he is already a solid unit.
That might bring its own problems as he gets accustomed to the intensity of the Premier League and, even in this encounter - played in pleasant conditions despite the sun and mid-afternoon kick-off - Leon seemed to be catching his breath on a couple of occasions.
""He's [in] the first week, second week in Manchester United. He did really well. He's learning things,"" Amorim told MUTV.
""He's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.""
Initially, he was caught out by overlapping runs from Willy Gnonto and Jayden Bogle. But he quickly worked out when danger might present itself and - with a bit of coaching from Luke Shaw, who was playing inside him as the left-sided central defender - he was not exposed in the same manner again.
After Casemiro's deflected shot had bounced back off the top of the crossbar, Leon was confident enough to try to convert the rebound even though the angle was virtually impossible.
It was no surprise he failed, but the attitude bodes well for the future.
Along with the rest of Amorim's starting line-up, the teenager was replaced at half-time in readiness for the three-match trip to the United States to play in the Premier League Summer Series.
Heaton and Meslier ensure goalless game
Having praised one of the youngest players in United's squad, they had the oldest to thank for keeping Leeds out.
Veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton signed a one-year contract extension three weeks ago and, with Andre Onana injured, the 39-year-old is pushing Altay Bayindir for the interim first-choice role.
And he caught the eye with three excellent second-half saves. Largie Ramazani was denied twice but the best was the first after Joel Piroe had set up Bogle.
Amorim said he feels the ""environment is really good"" at Manchester United at the moment, highlighting the togetherness in the team.
""Of course, sometimes we are going to struggle,"" he said. ""But what I feel since the first moment is that we are going to struggle, but we are struggling together.
""That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality because this club is not just about the effort. It's the quality. You have to win games.""
Interestingly for Leeds, while striker Patrick Bamford did not make the trip - and no explanation was offered before kick-off - Jack Harrison, who has spent the past two season on loan at Everton and is expected to move again, started.
Jaka Bijol and Lukas Nmecha were also given first starts by boss Daniel Farke, while fellow new signings Gabriel Gudmundsson, Sean Longstaff and Sebastiaan Bornauw came on after half-time - with actor Will Ferrell, an investor in Leeds, watching on from the stands.
As news filtered through of Leeds having a £17m bid accepted by German club Hoffenheim for their midfielder Anton Stach, it is clear Farke, like Amorim, can expect plenty of improvement from his side before their return to the top flight against Everton on 18 August.
Manchester United finished on top. Illan Meslier got down low to deny Patrick Dorgu and amid a frenetic ending Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar before the Leeds goalkeeper denied Ayden Heaven.

Deal in principle agreed for Rashford to join Barcelona,A deal in principle is agreed over a possible deal that would see Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford join Barcelona.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8j1d0v2pd8o,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 18:30:04",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford's dream transfer to Barcelona is moving closer with a deal in principle reached over a potential loan move to the Spanish giants.
Barcelona have been Rashford's preferred destination since he suggested it was time for a new challenge in December after being dropped by head coach Ruben Amorim.
BBC Sport has been told talks have taken place involving intermediaries and an outline verbal agreement has been reached.
The transfer would be an initial loan with an option to buy.
Spanish champions Barcelona looked set to sign Spain winger Nico Williams earlier this summer.
However, the 22-year-old signed a new 10-year contract at Athletic Bilbao.
Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, where he made 17 appearances across all competitions - scoring four goals and providing six assists.
He is one of five United players - and the highest paid - told to train separately from Amorim's squad amid a stand-off over their futures.
The 27-year-old does not believe he will play for United again while Amorim is at the club.
Him joining Barcelona would be a big positive for United as they look to strengthen Amorim's squad.
With more than £130m committed to signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, further deals have to be funded through departures.
Even if Rashford's exit were initially on loan, the saving off the wage bill would be significant given only Casemiro earns more than his £325,000-a-week salary.
We like Rashford - Deco
Barcelona sporting director Deco has previously spoken of his admiration for Rashford - as well as Liverpool winger Luis Diaz.
""When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team,"" he told Catalan radio station RAC1 in May.
""We like Luis, we like Rashford and we like other players,"" he said.
For his part, Rashford last month spoke of how he would like to play alongside teenage superstar Lamine Yamal at Barcelona.
""Everyone wants to play with the best. Hopefully... We'll see,"" he said in an interview with Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz.
Rashford's Old Trafford contract runs until June 2028 but the England international has not been given a squad number for the new season and was left behind to train at Carrington while the first team travelled to Sweden, where they drew 0-0 with newly-promoted Leeds United in their first match of pre-season on Saturday.
Rashford came through the academy ranks at his hometown club, making his debut in February 2016 as an 18-year-old, under Louis van Gaal.
He has gone on to score 138 goals for the club in 426 appearances but has not pulled on a United shirt since being substituted during a 2-1 Europa League win over Czech side Viktoria Plzen on 12 December.
Amorim dropped Rashford for last season's league derby against Manchester City at the Etihad later that month, going public with his concerns over the efforts he and team-mate Alejandro Garnacho had put into training.
If he were to complete a move to Barcelona, he would be joining a side that won a league and cup double in Hansi Flick's first season as manager.

Attacking midfielder Dowman and centre-back Salmon will join new recruits Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Christian Norgaard as part of the 30-man  travelling party.
However, £48.5m signing Noni Madueke will not be involved as he rests after his exploits with Chelsea in the Club World Cup.
The 23-year-old will join up with the squad when they return from Asia.
The Gunners will play two games in Singapore - AC Milan on 23 July and Newcastle on 27 July - before flying to Hong Kong for a north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur on 31 July.
Dowman, who does not turn 16 until December, has been training with the senior squad for some time and travelled with the team to their winter training camp in January.
Due to Premier League rules, Dowman could not make his debut last season as he was named in the Arsenal Under-15 squad.
He has been given the number 56 for the tour with manager Mikel Arteta calling him a ""huge talent"" and hinting that he could be part of his plans this season.
Dowman scored 19 goals and had five assists during 23 games in all competitions for Arsenal's youth teams last season.
He also became the youngest scorer in European Under-17 Championship history when he netted in England's win over the Czech Republic in May.

"In the crazed transfer trolley dash, the next glossy off-the-shelf solution is all the rage | Jonathan Wilson",Early moves in the market are revealing about the state of the Premier League title contenders and their priorities,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/19/in-the-crazed-transfer-trolley-dash-the-next-glossy-off-the-shelf-solution-is-all-the-rage,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 19:00:28",Jonathan Wilson,['Arsenal'],"The transfer window at this stage is essentially fan fiction. What if Dr Frankenstein had turned up at Pemberley and conducted a waspish romance with Elizabeth Bennet? What if Akela was not just a wolf but a werewolf? What if famous and attractive Tennis Player X were having a fling with famous and attractive Tennis Player Y? And what if Arsenal actually signed a centre-forward?
There hasn’t yet been time for reality to intervene. It’s like the day after the World Cup draw when everything exists in a realm of pure perfection and you can imagine the platonic ideal of each country facing off, unsullied by form, injury or disputes over bonuses.
Club A needs a left-winger who can cut in on to his right foot, contributing six-to-eight goals a season and opening space for the overlapping full-back. Player B is a left-winger who can cut infield, and therefore this must work, earning Club A imaginary points to contribute towards that absurd modern notion: winning the window.
The truth is that football teams are almost infinitely complex organisms, minute imbalances or frictions potentially having enormous consequences elsewhere. And players are human. Sometimes they struggle to deal with change: new teammates, a new manager, a new environment. No transfer is ever without at least some risk; nothing is ever guaranteed.
Still, the early moves in the market are revealing, if not necessarily for what they may mean for how the title contenders may play next season, then at least for what they say about the state of those clubs and their perceived priorities.
Getting your transfer business done early is one of the supposed markers of a decisive side that knows its own mind, which is good news for the four teams likely to be Premier League contenders – and rather less good news for Manchester United, who have moved to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while struggling to offload any of the half dozen players who are surplus to requirements.
The best time to build, the ancient wisdom has it, is from a position of strength, and Liverpool have done that, bringing in a pair of full-backs and Florian Wirtz at a total cost of around £165m. With Trent Alexander-Arnold gone and Andy Robertson now 31, the acquisitions of Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez are straightforward enough replacements and suggest the policy of attacking full-backs will remain.
Wirtz is a more complicated case, in part because of his versatility. He could operate as a false 9, or on either flank, but the likelihood is he will be used as a central attacking midfielder as part of a shift to more of a 4-2-3-1 shape than the hybrid 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 Liverpool tended to use last season. That would mean either Dominik Szoboszlai plays less or that he is used deeper at times to add creativity against opponents who sit in a low block.
Given Arne Slot’s lack of faith in Darwin Núñez, a move for a centre-forward was always likely. Exactly what game of bluff and counter-bluff – if any – was being played around Alexander Isak remains unclear but Hugo Ekitike is now the prime target, a mobile goalscorer who should improve Liverpool’s options playing in transition even if concerns remain about his effectiveness when he doesn’t have space to run into.
While there has been interest in Luis Díaz from Bayern, Liverpool’s position on profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) is healthy enough that there is no need to sell the Colombian. Perming three or four from Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, Harvey Elliott, Wirtz, Díaz and Isak or Ekitike marks a significant upgrade on last season.
For Arsenal, after becoming the fifth club to finish as runners-up three years running, there is a sense of urgency. If not now, then when? How many more chances will this side have before the rump needs refreshing? That perhaps explains their targets.
Christian Nørgaard is not especially eye-catching but adds useful defensive depth. Martín Zubimendi should have the tactical intelligence to protect the back four and so release Declan Rice. There will be those who doubt whether Noni Madueke is worth £48.5m, but a winger who can play on either flank makes sense to ease the burden on Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli.
The glaring necessity, then, is for a centre-forward, albeit one who shares the responsibility with Kai Havertz, although he may end up dropping deeper at times to relieve Martin Ødegaard. Benjamin Sesko had been the long-term target before Arsenal turned their attention to the older and slightly cheaper Viktor Gyökeres. Given Arsenal almost certainly do need a high-class centre-forward, saving £10m-£15m for a player five years older about whom doubts remain about his capacity to get shots away in tight spaces seems a questionable economy.
Manchester City’s transition continues apace, with the arrival of Rayan Cherki, Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Aït-Nouri to go with the four players they signed in January. All played some role in the Club World Cup. City’s 4-3 defeat by Al-Hilal in the last 16 does not augur well, but it’s far from clear yet how reliable a guide the tournament will prove.
After all, Chelsea, fourth in the Premier League, won the thing by hammering Paris Saint-Germain, who beat three English sides on their way to the Champions League last season. Have Enzo Maresca’s side really improved so much? João Pedro looks an immediate upgrade on Nicolas Jackson at centre-forward while Jamie Gittens should be a useful addition on the left.
Although a functioning team does seem belatedly to have emerged from the churn, it’s the sheer traffic through Stamford Bridge that is most eye-catching, less the careful accumulation of ingredients than a crazed trolley dash, with a lot of wastage as Maresca assembled his dish.
And that perhaps is the underlying sadness in any discussion of transfers, the way that the game is instinctively viewed through a mercantile lens. It’s never about developing a player or tweaking a system, always about buying the next glossy off-the-shelf solution.
Will any of it work? Who knows? But the feeling is all a little like 2016 after Leicester won the league and Southampton and West Ham finished in the top seven, when the elite went on a spree to reaffirm their status. Eventually, money always wins.

Marcus Rashford in talks with Barcelona after Manchester United agree loan,Barcelona offer includes an option to buy the striker,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/19/marcus-rashford-in-talks-with-barcelona-after-manchester-united-agree-loan,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 15:03:09",Andy Hunter,['Manchester United'],"Marcus Rashford is closing in on a move to Barcelona after Manchester United agreed in principle to loan the striker to the Spanish champions.
Barcelona’s offer, which has been made through intermediaries, includes an option to buy the 27-year-old next summer and has been sanctioned by their head coach, Hansi Flick. Rashford has held talks with Flick while his brother and representative, Dwaine Maynard, met Barcelona officials in Catalonia last month.
The England international is one of five United players who have been told they have no future at the club and made to train away from Ruben Amorim’s squad this summer. Rashford, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, has been training at a gym in Salford and at United’s Carrington base, although only after first-team players have left.
United value Rashford at £40m but, with no permanent offers arriving for a player who has three years remaining on a £325,000-a-week contract, Barcelona’s offer could suit all parties.
The striker has ruled out a wage cut and wants to join a club in the Champions League rather than move to the Saudi Pro League. Talks between United and Barcelona are understood to be continuing but the outline of an agreement is in place.
Flick wants to add versatile forwards to his squad this summer despite having Lamine Yamal and Raphinha at his disposal. Barcelona were interested in the Liverpool winger Luis Díaz but were informed the Colombia international is not for sale.
Liverpool have rejected a €67.5m offer from Bayern Munich for Díaz. The Spanish champions also attempted to buy Nico Williams before the forward signed an eight-year contract extension with Athletic, his boyhood club in Bilbao.
Rashford has spent 20 years at United, scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances for his boyhood team, but has not featured since being dropped by Amorim for the Manchester derby last December. He said later that month that he was ready for a new challenge away from Old Trafford.
Amorim’s team drew 0-0 with Leeds in their first pre-season friendly in Stockholm on Saturday. Kick off at the Strawberry Arena was delayed by 10 minutes because of heavy traffic outside the stadium. Matheus Cunha made his United debut following his £62.5m arrival from Wolves and played the opening 45 minutes before Amorim made 11 changes at the interval.
Amorim says Cunha showed what United have been missing. “I think Matheus Cunha showed what we need - that is the player when he receives the ball between the lines can be really aggressive in direction of the opponent. We watched that during last season in a different team, so we expect the same thing. Of course, you can see that the connection between him and Bruno [Fernandes] is still not there, but it’s going to be a good connection.”
United head to the United States next week for the Premier League Summer Series against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton and hope to include Bryan Mbeumo in their travelling party. Old Trafford officials agreed a deal that could rise to £71m on Friday for the Brentford forward, who underwent his United medical on Saturday.
After the game in Stockholm, Daniel Farke confirmed that he had told Patrick Bamford that the striker was not going to be involved in Leeds’ Premier League campaign, because of his fitness problems over the past couple of years. The Leeds manager said: “Patrick knows how much I value him as a player, I have spoken several times about this, and that I would have preferred a completely fit Patrick Bamford, in the last two seasons. He also knows how much I rate him as a person, but I thought it was my duty to have a very open and honest conversation with him right now, straight away with him.
“The second day of pre-season I got him into my office and told him that he was not in my plans for the upcoming Premier League season, just in the fact that he had really difficult years in the last years.”

Frank and open: early observations as Dane’s Spurs tenure begins with friendly win,Tottenham beat Reading thanks to fine outings for Thomas Frank’s new signings Mohammed Kudus and Luka Vuskovic,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/19/early-observations-thomas-frank-spurs-tenure-begins-friendly-win-reading,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 18:53:47",David Hytner,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"It is rarely wise to read deeply into pre-season fixtures. Especially the opening one. Yet when it is the first game for a manager at a club, the temptation is there. How can it not be? The initial glimpses offer the outline of the plan.
Thomas Frank got his Tottenham tenure under way with a 2-0 win over Reading at the Select Car Leasing Stadium on Saturday afternoon. He played different XIs in each half and the goals came early in the second period from Will Lankshear and Luka Vuskovic. For the latter, it represented the gloss on an eye-catching first appearance.
With the chair, Daniel Levy, looking down from the directors’ box, flanked by the technical director, Johan Lange, whose profile is fast on the rise, Spurs had too much for their League One opponents, who are also at the start of a new era, Rob Couhig having taken over as the owner after the turbulent tenure of Dai Yongge.
The stadium was sold out, with the 3,000 or so visiting Spurs fans keen to proclaim themselves as “champions of Europe” after May’s Europa League triumph. Expect to hear that on repeat in the coming months. There was plenty to pick over.
How did Frank set up?
The short answer was in a 4-2-3-1 formation, but Frank is all about flexibility and there were a number of takeaways, particularly in possession. He started with Mikey Moore on the left wing but the teenager was given the licence to drift inside to connect with the No 10, which at the outset was another youngster, Alfie Devine. This created the space for Destiny Udogie to push high up from left-back, with Spurs building in a back three. On the other wing, Brennan Johnson played high and wide. Of the central midfield pair, Rodrigo Bentancur sat and Pape Sarr pushed up at times. The approach with the ball was similar after the interval, although this time it was the right-winger, Mohammed Kudus – on his first appearance after signing from West Ham – who roamed inside, allowing the right-back, Djed Spence, to overlap. Out of possession, Spurs broadly pressed in a 4-4-2, with the No 10 squeezing high.
What was notable in terms of personnel?
Frank brought a 26-man squad and there were notable absentees – above and beyond the injured Dejan Kulusevski and Radu Dragusin plus James Maddison, who is only part-training with the squad after an injury of his own. Archie Gray, Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel were given additional leave after their involvement in the European Under-21 Championship and did not travel, Frank preferring that they stayed at Hotspur Way to train in the morning. Richarlison did likewise. The striker was involved with Brazil up to the second week of June and he is taking care with his return in light of previous injury problems. As an aside, Richarlison is understood to be keen on staying at Spurs; only if something exceptional showed up would he consider leaving. Kota Takai, the new Japanese signing, was not in Reading. He has a minor contact injury.
Any sign of the Frank set-piece effect?
It was certainly striking to see Spurs practise corners and free-kicks on the pitch about 20 minutes before kick-off, with all the outfield starters defending the deliveries from the youngster George Abbott, who would be an unused substitute. Attacking them were members of Frank’s coaching staff. He enjoyed great rewards on set pieces at Brentford and the early signs here were positive, both goals coming after corners from Kudus. The taker in the first half had been Pedro Porro. The opener followed a header by Vuskovic for Lankshear to nod home from close range and the second came after Kudus crossed low for Vuskovic, Reading having withstood the first phase of the move. There were no long throws, albeit there were minimal opportunities for Spurs to try one.
Vuskovic makes his mark
The towering 18-year-old Vuskovic, who played the second half at right centre-back, with Micky van de Ven to his left, agreed to move to Spurs from Hajduk Split in September 2023. There has been a lot of noise about his potential, a lot of expectation as he starred on loan at Westerlo in the Belgian top flight last season where he weighed in with seven goals. What an impact he had. The Croat had already clattered into one challenge and just about got away with a play-out-from-the-back move when he teed up Lankshear’s goal. His finish for the second was a beauty, a first-time left-foot drive, low into the far corner after Kudus’s pass. The Danish manager is blessed with centre-halves. Behind Cristian Romero and Van de Ven, he has Kevin Danso, Dragusin and Takai. Vuskovic would not be short of loan options if he were to sense he will not get the minutes he needs; Hamburg would be one in the Bundesliga. He wants to play at Spurs.
Kudus is the real star
If it was easy to be drawn in by Vuskovic, it was impossible to ignore Kudus. Yes, it was only League One opposition, but the £54.5m new boy wowed with his sharpness and balance, his work in tight spaces, the impression he gave of always being in control of the ball and the situation. There was an explosion up the wing that led to a big chance for Jamie Donley, some lovely spins and time-buying feints, and the overall feeling that he seriously enjoyed himself.

‘Literature has completely changed my life’: footballer Héctor Bellerín’s reading list,"Former Arsenal player wins admiration for his taste in books, but admits one novel defeated him",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jul/19/literature-changed-my-life-arsenal-hector-bellerin-arsenal,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 11:01:18",Lanre Bakare,['Arsenal'],"Héctor Bellerín’s summer holidays look a little different from your typical footballer. Rather than pictures from a recent jaunt to Ibiza clubs such as Ushuaia or questionable birthday parties, his Instagram is dominated by books.
Images of paperbacks he’s read are all over his feed, a mix of classics and contemporary novels, with a majority from Spain and South America.
Alana Portero’s celebrated (and Pedro Almodóvar-approved) novels about queer life in 80s Madrid feature on his read pile, alongside the Mexican Juan Rulfo’s classic surrealist novel Pedro Páramo, which inspired a young Gabriel García Márquez to write One Hundred Years of Solitude, and Federico García Lorca’s Gypsy Ballads.
Bellerín, who played for Arsenal for nine years before moving back to his native Spain with Real Betis, talks about literature’s transformative power.
“Literature has become something that has – and I know it’s a cliche – but to me, it has completely changed my life,” he said from a Betis training camp in Portugal.
Bellerín’s love of literature was sparked during the Covid-19 lockdowns, when the young full-back was isolating in his home in St Albans, Hertfordshire. He began reading the novels of Charles Bukowski while he was still playing for Arsenal.
He made his way through Hollywood and Post Office, the American writer’s autobiographical debut, which follows the life of the sardonic anti-hero Henry Chinaski. “I was miserable in quarantine,” said Bellerín. “I didn’t know when football was going to come back. I was even drinking a lot … I had a bit of a tough time. Literature, I’m not gonna say made me survive, but it made my life way easier.”
Some footballers might shy away from sharing their love of reading, especially in a climate when anything outside the football bubble is deemed a “distraction”, but Bellerín has made no secret of his interests beyond sport.
He’s flirted with fashion, and even started his own label. He loves photography, and believes passionately in the power of art to help with mental health. He has been a vocal advocate for sustainability in football, and in 2022 he criticised the lack of media coverage of conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Yemen compared with Ukraine.
Bellerín grew up in a house of books. His father had a passion for ancient Greece, which inspired Bellerín’s first name. But between the ages of 19 and 26 he read mostly nonfiction (mirroring the habits of many young men).
Reading was something he did to learn something, rather than for pleasure. “When I read something, it had to have a purpose and then I realised it was the other way around,” he said.
The work of the German-Swiss novelist Hermann Hesse followed Bukowski, but after making his way through 10 books, the Spaniard realised that he’d only read male writers and made a conscious decision to read more women.
He moved on to The Vegetarian by the Nobel prize winner Han Kang, and Naomi Klein’s Doppelganger, while cool, contemporary Spanish writers such as José Luis Sastre, Adrian Daine, Marta Jiménez Serrano, Carolina Yuste and the Granta young writer Cristina Morales dominate his book piles.
Sergio C Fanjul, a culture writer at the Spanish daily El País, said the list showed Bellerín was “closely attuned to the pulse of the publishing world”, with writers such as Portero, Leila Guerriero, Marta Jiménez Serrano, Juan Tallon and Alejandro Zambra being some of the “most critically acclaimed writers” of recent years. “I think Bellerín is a reader who doesn’t simply follow mainstream trends,” Fanjul added.
On his Portuguese training trip he’s brought a book of Leslie Jamison essays, Mary Karr’s Art of Memoir, Sara Mesa’s Cara de Pan, Simon Critchley’s What We Think About When We Think About Football and Samanta Schweblin’s Little Eyes, which the Guardian called “ingenious”.
The footballer gets recommendations from a writing group he attends every Tuesday night in Seville. Made up of students, doctors and engineers, the group has introduced him to the contemporary Spanish literary scene.
“We feed off each other, recommending books and movies. My taste has also changed, because the people I’ve got around me have great taste and give great recommendations, new names and new faces and new ways of writing.”
There’s only one book that’s defeated him.
He tried Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights in the original English before reverting to the Spanish translation, titled Cumbres Borrascosas. “I couldn’t get through that in English,” Bellerín confessed. “I tried it, but couldn’t.”
