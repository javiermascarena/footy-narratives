AC Milan in talks over deal for Hojlund after Sesko arrival,AC Milan are in talks with Manchester United over the signing of striker Rasmus Hojlund.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13409524/man-utd-transfer-news-ac-milan-in-talks-over-deal-for-rasmus-hojlund-after-benjamin-sesko-arrival,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 07:25:00",,['Manchester United'],"AC Milan are in talks with Manchester United over the signing of striker Rasmus Hojlund.
Milan want to complete a loan deal with an option to buy, but United's preference is to do a permanent deal - or at least have a permanent element attached to any loan.
They would consider offers of around £40m for the 22-year-old Denmark international.
The £73.7m arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig is likely to limit Hojlund's game time for United moving forward if he stays.
Hojlund was an unused substitute in United's pre-season friendly against Fiorentina on Saturday despite being the only recognised striker in the squad - he was the only first-team regular not to get on the pitch.
Head coach Ruben Amorim opted to play Mason Mount as a false No 9 instead, telling MUTV afterwards: ""We struggled without a reference as a striker. We have a new player, so we'll see.""
Hojlund wants to stay and fight for his place, but it is now clear he has joined the likes of Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia as players United want out.
Hojlund initially joined Manchester United from Atalanta for £72m in August 2023.
Sesko was formally presented to Man Utd supporters on Saturday, ahead of the club's 1-1 friendly draw with Fiorentina.
The striker was unveiled before kick-off but unavailable to play.
The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with Man Utd set to pay an initial £66.26m (€76.5m) with £7.36m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons.
Sesko is the third forward to arrive at Old Trafford this summer after Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, costing a combined £207.2m.
Sky Sports News reporter Dharmesh Sheth:
Following Sesko's arrival, the focus at Man Utd is now on departures.
Along with AC Milan's interest in Hojlund, Borussia Dortmund are still pursuing a deal for Sancho while a formal offer from Chelsea for Garnacho is expected.
Real Betis continue to work on a deal to sign Antony.
However, United may not be finished when it comes to incomings and want to be in a position to act if a good market opportunity presents itself.
Recruiting a central midfielder appears to be high on the agenda and interest in Brighton's Carlos Baleba remains.
United have explored the conditions of a deal but it looks like a very difficult transfer to do, not least because Brighton do not want to sell - and are under no pressure to.
Baleba has not featured for Brighton since the pre-season victory over Stoke City in Marbella in mid-July due to a minor knee injury.

Nunez joins Al Hilal from Liverpool,Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez has joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal in a deal worth up to &#163;56.6m (&#8364;65m).,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13408142/darwin-nunez-joins-al-hilal-liverpool-sell-striker-to-saudi-pro-league-club-in-deal-worth-up-to-56-6m,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 21:00:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez has joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal in a deal worth up to £56.6m (€65m).
Al Hilal will pay the Premier League champions a fixed fee of £46.2m (€53m) plus add-ons.
Nunez, 26, departs Anfield having scored 40 goals in 143 appearances since joining in 2022 from Benfica in a deal which initially cost the Reds £64m.
Despite scoring 18 goals in Jurgen Klopp's final season, he managed only seven last term under Arne Slot, although did net two vital stoppage-time goals to give Liverpool a 2-0 win at Brentford in January.
Nunez came close to leaving earlier this year, having pushed for the club to act upon serious and significant interest - also from the Saudi league - during that window.
Liverpool held firm and rejected that approach, prioritising the campaign for a historic 20th league title. This summer, Nunez and his representatives reiterated their desire for a transfer.
AC Milan were interested and made an approach, but were unlikely to ever match Al Hilal's figures. A bid from Napoli was rejected earlier in the window not only because the valuation fell short, but also due to proposed payment terms that would have deferred any funds until summer 2026, to be paid over five years.
Liverpool are now expected to explore the market for an attacking option that can come into the squad as a starter.
The Premier League champions had a £110m bid plus add-ons rejected by Newcastle for striker Alexander Isak and remain huge admirers of the Sweden international, who is valued at £150m.
Sky Sports News has been reporting that Newcastle are braced for Liverpool to go back in for Isak, who has been instructed to stay away from the Newcastle first team and will miss their Premier League opener against Aston Villa, confirmed head coach Eddie Howe.
Newcastle are still looking for a signing to replace Callum Wilson, let alone Isak, and appear set to lose out to Manchester United in the race for Benjamin Sesko.
It is understood that Liverpool will only pursue a target if they are viewed to be realistically attainable and available for what they deem to be a fair price.
The club are also keen to leave a pathway for 16-year-old winger Rio Ngumoha into the first-team squad after his impressive performances in pre-season.
Jamie Carragher says he wants Liverpool to sign Isak, but has questioned whether the club should be spending such big money.
Earlier in August, Liverpool made an initial bid of £110m plus add-ons, Sky Sports News reported. However, the total offer did not reach £120m, with the Magpies valuing the striker at £150m.
Liverpool have also signed Hugo Ekitike this summer, who can also play as a No 9, and Carragher says splashing out on the forward to have him potentially be a back-up ""doesn't sit right"" with him.
Speaking on The Overlap, he said: ""It will be an amazing signing. But from a Liverpool fan point of view, I don't want the club to spend £150m on Isak.
""I could probably imagine that he was Liverpool's No 1 target but there's something about Liverpool buying a striker [Ekitike] for £80m and he's a back-up. There's something about it that doesn't sit right to me.
""I look at Isak, he's obviously thrown his toys out of the pram once Arsenal and Liverpool signed a striker. From him and his agent's point of view, did they not tell Newcastle months ago that they wanted to move on? It just seems a little bit messy.
""When I think of Liverpool, it doesn't look really planned. I don't think the plan is to sign a striker for £80m and sign one for £120m.
""I feel for Ekitike a little bit. Because he's been brought in and then all of a sudden this Isak thing has come.
""I do want Liverpool to sign Isak, but £150m for me feels like an Mbappe. You should be getting Mbappe for £150m.""

The next Haaland? What Sesko will bring to the Premier League,"Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399997/benjamin-sesko-new-man-utd-forward-likened-to-man-citys-erling-haaland-but-could-he-flourish,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 10:45:00",Nick Wright,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?
Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?
And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?
Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...
His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.
His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.
Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.
Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.
His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.
Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.
RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.
His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.
Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.
That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.
It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.
Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.
His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.
Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.
That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.
Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.
Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.
That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.
Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.
Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.
It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.
At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.
Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.
He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.
Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.
That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.
That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.
Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.
This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.
There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.
But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.
It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.
He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.

"Humble, generous and a star - Jota left his mark on everyone he met","As Liverpool prepare for their first competitive game since his death, BBC Sport remembers ""humble"" Diogo Jota.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gm7n5j8vpo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 07:09:05",Marcus Alves,['Liverpool'],"Teresa Barbosa was there from the very beginning.
Barbosa was the first face Diogo Jota saw when he arrived aged 16 at Pacos de Ferreira's dormitory from his hometown of Gondomar.
From cleaning to doing laundry and cooking meals, she did a bit of everything as she took care of players who came from other Portuguese cities and from abroad to join the side based in the town of the same name just outside Porto.
They usually joined Pacos' youth teams and then left the dormitory after being promoted to the senior side. Jota was there for three years, however.
At one point, he was the only first-team footballer living in the dormitory, despite the club offering him an apartment.
The forward could have left way earlier, but he remained on his own in the room he used to share with right-back Fred Martins until the day he packed his things to join Atletico Madrid in 2016.
Jota just didn't feel the need to move out.
Above all, he considered Barbosa to be his family away from home.
""A lot of other people in my situation would've made a different choice, but there you go, everyone has their own path, and I believe that says a bit about who I am,"" the former Liverpool player would say to anyone who asked him about it.
Jota, who tragically died in a car accident in Spain alongside his brother Andre Silva in early July, embodied that simplicity throughout his life.
As CNN pundit Sergio Pires reflected: ""He was an ordinary boy living in a world of superstars.""
And that's how he will be remembered when Liverpool face Crystal Palace in the Community Shield on Sunday in their first competitive match since his death.
The Reds fans have vowed to never forget their number 20.
The same way he never forgot those who helped him along the way.
When Jota married his high school sweetheart Rute Cardoso in June, he made sure Barbosa was invited to the ceremony.
""He went to England and, after all these years, he could've forgotten everything he lived through at Pacos, but no, he never forgot me. He invited me to his big day and sat me with his family,"" Barbosa revealed to the Jornal de Noticias.
""There was one moment that really touched me. We were all at the table, and after one of the dances, he walked past me, held my head, kissed me, and went back to his seat.""
'He had the biggest smile'
Even from afar, the Portugal hero remained deeply connected to his roots.
For his wedding, he wanted no presents. Instead, guests were encouraged to donate to groups such as the local fire brigade and animal welfare organisations.
""Jota had the biggest smile - whenever he smiled, everyone around him felt happier,"" Vasco Seabra, one of his earliest mentors at Pacos and currently in charge of Portuguese top-flight club Arouca, told BBC Sport.
""Talking about Jota is talking about someone who was always incredibly humble. He had a very close relationship with Dona Teresa, the lady who looked after the dormitory and was a great cook. He felt truly at home there. It shows the kind of person he was - how he looked at people.
""He always saw people for who they really were, appreciated those who cared for him and had supported him over the years.""
The Portugal star left a mark on everyone he met.
So much so that Seabra went above and beyond to help him fulfil his dreams, emailing the national under-19 coach with a report detailing why the striker deserved a place. It worked as the head coach came to watch him.
Jota would go on to win a Premier League title and score 65 goals in 182 appearances for Liverpool, but he never lost sight of where he came from.
He would regularly send boxes of branded boots to Pacos and ask their kit man to give them to the kids in the youth teams who needed them most.
That's even more meaningful considering that growing up in Gondomar, on the edge of Porto, his parents couldn't afford to buy boots for him.
""We were factory workers, earning not much more than the minimum wage, but we never hid our limitations from our children. He never asked us for anything. He never even said he wanted a pair of branded boots. He knew it wasn't possible - he had that kind of awareness,"" his father Joaquim Silva told Maisfutebol.
'This was someone who knew his origins'
No matter the distance, Jota was always within reach.
""He never changed his phone number after leaving Pacos. He didn't need to. He always answered when people called,"" said former club president Paulo Meneses.
""Sometimes, tragic circumstances like his can make us overly generous in the way we speak about those who've passed. But that wasn't the case with him. He truly had two qualities that are essential in a person - humility and gratitude - and in him, they were undeniable.
""The last time we were promoted to the top flight in 2018-19, he sent me a message, humbly asking if he could come and watch. Then, on the day we won the league title, he sent me a message five seconds after the game had finished, saying, 'we've done it again'. This was someone who knew his origins.""
None of this will come as a surprise to those who shared a dressing room with him.
Former Liverpool and now Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher recalled how they would get together to follow Portuguese lower tiers.
""You became one of my closest friends in football. We bonded over everything sports-related, watching any football match we could find - often your brother Andre's games on your iPad,"" Kelleher wrote on social media.
It seems almost contradictory that someone so deeply connected to his upbringing could still adapt so seamlessly to wherever he went - whether it was Gondomar, Pacos, Porto, Wolverhampton or Liverpool.
""He was the most British foreign player I've ever met,"" said Liverpool's left-back Andy Robertson. ""We used to joke he was really Irish... I'd try to claim him as Scottish, obviously. I even called him Diogo MacJota.
""We'd watch the darts together, enjoy the horse racing. Going to Cheltenham this season was a highlight - one of the best times we had.""
It didn't matter to Jota that he had an academy named after him back home. Nor that a stand was built thanks to his transfer. Or even that he was scoring goals in the Champions League.
He was still the same guy who had overcome the odds to become a footballer.
""He was an incredible young man - strong personality, great character, and hugely competitive, always with a burning desire to win. But more than anything, he valued honesty, respected people who were straight with him, and had little time for those who beat around the bush,"" said Seabra.
He was a football superstar who knew that he would not have made it to the heights he achieved were it not for the help of the Teresas along the way.

"Nunez leaves Liverpool - was he a fan favourite, flop, or both?",Al-Hilal sign Uruguay striker Darwin Nunez from Premier League champions Liverpool in a deal worth £46.3m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gje4j37r9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 19:55:35",,['Liverpool'],"Darwin Nunez reached the end of his Liverpool career as the Uruguayan striker joined Al-Hilal on a three-year contract on Saturday.
The Saudi Pro League side secured a deal worth 53m euros (£46.3m) for the 26-year-old.
Nunez joined Liverpool in June 2022 from Portuguese side Benfica for an initial fee of £64m, arriving amid high expectations.
He scored 40 goals in 143 appearances for the Reds but only started eight Premier League games during their title-winning campaign last season.
A Liverpool statement read: ""Everybody at the club would like to thank Darwin for his contributions and wish him and his family all the best for the future.""
Nunez has joined the Al-Hilal squad on their pre-season training camp in Germany.
His departure may have an effect on Liverpool's pursuit of Sweden striker Alexander Isak, with Newcastle having turned down an opening offer of £110m.
Nunez leaves Liverpool having been unable to reach the heights it was hoped he would following his big-money move from Benfica.
There were moments of euphoria that will be fondly remembered by many on Merseyside: his late double to give 10-man Liverpool victory at Newcastle in August 2023, a 99th-minute winner against Nottingham Forest in March 2024 and two added-time goals against Brentford in January of this year, which helped to ensure Nunez leaves England as a Premier League winner.
However, there will be differing opinions over whether that is enough to override the frustration felt by many over his inconsistency in making such contributions - which convinced Liverpool head coach Arne Slot to seek other options.
The man referred to as 'Captain Chaos' by ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher struggled to hold down a regular starting role throughout his three seasons at Anfield.
After scoring 15 goals from 42 games in all competitions in his first season, his tally increased to 18 from 54 during his second, but Nunez was used less often after Slot succeeded Jurgen Klopp in 2024.
He scored just seven times from 47 appearances last term and, in all, managed 25 goals from 95 Premier League games, although 46 of those appearances came as a substitute.
Why did it not work out for Nunez at Liverpool?
Nunez's latest transfer fee is significantly less than the £85m package - including add-ons, of which not all were activated - that was required to sign him in 2022.
He signed a six-year deal on the back of a 2021-22 campaign in which he scored 34 times in 41 appearances for Benfica, including twice in Champions League matches against Liverpool.
Klopp warned it was important for the club and supporters to recognise that Nunez was a ""work in progress"", as evidenced in his first few appearances when he scored in back-to-back games but was sent off on his home debut for headbutting Fulham's Joachim Andersen.
The late interventions from Nunez which endeared him to supporters sporadically hinted at his latent talent, and were also a theme of his stay.
However, having fallen out of favour towards the end of Klopp's reign, a summer 2025 exit appeared increasingly likely when Slot criticised Nunez's work-rate after the forward allowed a poor miss to affect the rest of his performance against Aston Villa in February.
""Players miss chances - that I can accept,"" Slot said. ""What was a bit harder for me to accept was his behaviour after that chance, and by behaviour I mean it got too much in his head, where he wasn't the usual Darwin that works his butt off and makes sure he helps the team.""
Nunez, whose game is underpinned by energy and enthusiasm, ended the season having made just eight league starts, scoring five goals.
His exit comes after Liverpool's signings of French forward Hugo Ekitike for £79m and club-record £116m playmaker Florian Wirtz this window, as Slot rebuilds the team before his second season.
Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, The Redmen TV's Dan Clubbe said: ""The overriding feeling is frustration. [Nunez] came in for a lot of money and there was a lot of expectation around him.
""Given the money we spent on him, he probably has come some way short of what we expected, so [a move] probably is best for both parties.""
Misses, misfortune and memorable winners - Nunez's defining Liverpool stats
It is Nunez's statistics in front of goal - and most notably his wastefulness - which detractors will ultimately point to in defining the success of his Liverpool career.
Here are the headline numbers:
Nunez has the lowest shot conversion rate of all Liverpool's forwards over the past three seasons, with 11.1%
His expected goals (xG) underperformance is the poorest among Liverpool forwards since the start of the 2022-23 campaign, at -8.5xG
Of the 15 players to register the most shots in the Premier League since 2022-23, Nunez's conversion rate ranks second-lowest (25 goals from 226 attempts)
He is the Premier League's second-biggest xG underperformer in the past three seasons, after Dominic Calvert-Lewin (-13.7xG)
Of the 10 players to receive the most opportunities defined as 'big chances' since 2022-23, Nunez has the poorest conversion rate of those at 23.6%
But what else do the numbers tell us about Nunez - and why does he still leave Anfield as a fan favourite?
As previously alluded to, Nunez delivered memorable moments.
He produced more 90th-minute winners (three) than any other player in the Premier League since the start of the 2022-23 campaign. That includes goals in stoppage time.
In fact, only six players in Premier League history have scored more.
With fans desperate to see his Liverpool career ignite, they also often shared in his obvious exasperation as luck frequently appeared to elude him.
That was certainly evident when he hit the woodwork a Premier League record four times in a game against Chelsea during the 2023-24 season.
That misfortune contributed to him hitting the post or crossbar more times (14) than any other player since his Premier League debut.
'Nunez wore his heart on his sleeve' - the fan view
Liverpool fan writer Jordan Chamberlain, Empire of the Kop
What went wrong for Nunez?
If Darwin Nunez had a composure and calmness under stress to match his physical ability, we'd be talking about the best striker on the planet. And I mean that.
He is ferociously quick and powerful, but works hard off the ball, too. It's no wonder Jurgen Klopp was so desperate to sign him. But despite getting in great positions again and again, Nunez just couldn't finish.
His shooting when Liverpool were at 0-0 or one goal down was largely abysmal, except for the bizarre occurrences when he'd score 90th-minute winners.
Why is there a fondness from fans?
Nunez wore his heart on his sleeve and his fragility was endearing.
You could tell when it wasn't going well for him - it was written all over his face. But you could also see how desperately he wanted it. In the end, this probably held him back.
And yet, he still chased lost causes, closed things down and occasionally did brilliant things. His emotional vulnerability led fans to love him, especially those who go to Anfield - not the ones on the internet whose teasing also affected his confidence.
Is the sale the right move?
Of course.
He's effectively ended his career as a high-pedigree player by going to Saudi Arabia for the money.
If Liverpool can use the money recouped for Nunez on Alexander Isak, a massive upgrade, every supporter will be delighted. If we somehow don't buy a forward, we'll look very light up top, but I trust fully in Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes to get Isak done.

'World-class potential' - Sesko joins Man Utd for £74m,Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko becomes Manchester United's third major signing in attack this summer transfer window.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c39dx8mjd39o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 13:58:57",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have completed the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko in a move worth £73.7m.
The deal for the Slovenia international, who has joined on a five-year contract, includes a guaranteed payment of £66.3m, with the remainder in add-ons.
He is United's third major signing in attack following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Bryan Mbeumo for £65m with £6m in add-ons, with the trio presented to the club's fans prior to Saturday's pre-season home game against Fiorentina.
Sesko, 22, was also a target for Newcastle United but has chosen to join Ruben Amorim's side.
United finished 15th in the Premier League last season, while the Magpies were fifth and qualified for the Champions League in a campaign in which they also won the EFL Cup.
""The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,"" said Sesko.
""When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.
""From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.
""I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.""
Speaking to MUTV, United head coach Amorim said: ""He has the characteristics that we needed. Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.
""He is the right character in this group so we are really, really happy to have him.""
What will Sesko bring to Old Trafford?
Sesko has spent the past two seasons in Germany with Leipzig, having joined them from sister club Salzburg in 2023.
He scored 39 goals in 87 games in all competitions, along with eight assists, with 27 of those coming in 64 Bundesliga appearances.
Sesko is the top goalscorer currently aged under 23 in Europe's top five leagues, in all competitions.
He is one ahead of Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham and five clear of Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for an initial £100m this summer.
Sesko was one of the fastest strikers in the Bundesliga, reaching a top speed of 35.7km/h - and, helped by his 6ft 5in stature, had the highest aerial success rate among strikers, winning 57.4% of aerial duels.
Only six forwards have scored more goals in the Bundesliga in the past two seasons, even though Sesko was 16th for expected goals, 14th on shots and 22nd on touches in the opposition box.
He is a threat from long range too, with 36.8% of his shots - and 23.1% of his goals - coming from outside the box. Both are higher than any Bundesliga striker to score 12 or more goals last season.
Last season he also became more of an all-rounder, with 9.7% of his touches coming in the opposition box - compared with 17% the season before - while he got involved more on both wings and further back into midfield.
""Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football,"" said Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox.
""We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.
""Working under the guidance of Ruben and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.""
What does this mean for Hojlund?
The arrival of Sesko puts a question mark over the future of Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund at the Old Trafford club.
Hojlund recently stated his intention to remain at United, even if there was increased competition for his place in manager Amorim's side.
However, United are understood to be prepared to sell the 22-year-old for £30m and Italian club AC Milan are interested in signing him, although they would initially want to take him on loan.
Hojlund has only scored 14 Premier League goals in two seasons since joining United in a deal worth £72m from Atalanta and was an unused substitute as they beat Italian side Fiorentina 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in their final pre-season friendly.

'A game I'll never forget' - De Gea on 'emotional' Old Trafford return,"David de Gea describes his return to Old Trafford in Saturday's friendly between Manchester United and Fiorentina as ""emotional"".",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2qv0e7gxvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 16:27:26",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"There was something fitting about Altay Bayindir saving the penalty that earned Manchester United victory in their final pre-season friendly with Fiorentina.
This, after all, was the day David de Gea returned to Old Trafford.
It is two summers since De Gea was unceremoniously dumped by United after 545 appearances - putting him seventh on the club's all-time list - as then-manager Erik ten Hag opted to pay £47.2m to Inter Milan for Andre Onana.
De Gea said at the time he wondered whether he should pack in football altogether. He didn't - but the debate about the wisdom of his exit continues.
Many question whether Onana was worth it.
A direct comparison on this occasion was impossible. Onana was not involved as he continues his recovery from the hamstring injury that makes him a major doubt for next weekend's opening Premier League game against Arsenal.
If the Cameroon international is not fit, Bayindir will step in.
The Turkey international was expected to leave United this summer after losing out to Onana in the quest to feature in what turned out to be a Europa League final defeat by Tottenham.
But suitors for Bayindir have not been plentiful.
It will, at least, have done the 27-year-old's confidence some good to have turned away Fabiano Parisi's spot-kick - the only time either goalkeeper touched any of the 10 penalties - in a 5-4 shootout victory that followed Saturday's 1-1 draw.
'Sometimes it's difficult to describe with words'
De Gea had gone off by then, replaced before the final whistle. He was given a standing ovation, echoing the reception he got when he came out for the warm-up and again at the start of the game, by an Old Trafford crowd in excess of 60,000.
It was the chance to say goodbye he had not been afforded in 2023.
""It's a game I'll never forget, for sure,"" said the 34-year-old.
""Sometimes it's difficult to describe with words how you feel on the pitch, seeing the crowd, with everybody there. It was so emotional for me.""
De Gea was complimentary about his old club, saying ""you can't control everything"" about the manner of his departure.
There was unhappiness, though. The perceived wisdom is merely that De Gea's kicking ability was not at the standard Ten Hag required.
Yet, in a similar situation two years ago, Onana played the ball out from the back in a pre-season match against Lens, only for Diogo Dalot to immediately give the ball away.
Onana was out of his box as the ball sailed over his head and into the net from about 50 yards.
Kicking the ball is just part of a goalkeeper's armoury. De Gea's former United team-mate Nemanja Matic offered his own insight into the depth of feeling the former Spain international's departure caused, before a European game against Lyon in April.
""If you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's history, you need to take care what you're talking about,"" said Matic, in response to Onana's claim they ""should"" beat Lyon, which they did - but only after a stunning extra-time comeback.
""If it was [Edwin] Van der Sar, [Peter] Schmeichel or [David] De Gea saying that, then I would question myself. But you need to have cover to say something like that.""
On Saturday, De Gea just enjoyed being back in Manchester. There was one loose kick straight out of play and he was sent tumbling by a collision involving his own player in the build-up to United's equaliser, which went down as a Robin Gosen's own goal.
But he made some excellent saves, including a reaction to deny Leny Yoro that had the young Frenchman punching the ground in frustration.
Bayindir made some too - the best to deny former Everton forward Moise Kean, even if an offside flag he was not aware of was raised.
Few would argue Bayindir would be an upgrade on De Gea, but that is not really the point.
It has been claimed privately that once De Gea knew which way the wind was blowing on his United career, his performances dipped.
Yet, given the choice, many United fans would prefer to have De Gea in goal against Arsenal ahead of Onana.
It won't happen, of course. The respective paths have gone in different directions.
'He's the reason I came to United'
Now De Gea can only look on from afar in the knowledge that since his last appearance (the 2023 FA Cup final defeat by Manchester City), his old club have gained revenge for that loss, but also finished eighth and 15th - unimaginable for three decades.
De Gea met Sir Alex Ferguson, who brought him to United from Atletico Madrid in 2011, on Friday afternoon.
His respect for the Scot is huge.
""He's the boss, the reason I came to United,"" he said.
As for his old club, like many, he can only hope for better.
""I know it's been some years that United struggle a bit but it's one of the best clubs in the world.
""It's a massive club and hopefully this year with the new signings and the manager starting a new era they can do something big. Hopefully, this year they can be where they deserve.""

Arsenal actively looking at options - Arteta,"Arsenal are still ""actively looking at options"" in the transfer market and could sign more players before the window closes, says manager Mikel Arteta.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ylp7qkvypo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 20:25:43",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal are still ""actively looking at options"" in the transfer market and could sign more players before the window closes, manager Mikel Arteta says.
The Gunners have brought in Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke, Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard, Cristhian Mosquera and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga for about £190m during the summer.
""Let's see what happens, in terms of where the squad is in the next few weeks,"" said Arteta. ""But we are actively looking at options.
""As well, there are a few players that, maybe, they have to leave as well. So, we will be open to see what happens.""
Arsenal finished their pre-season campaign with a 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao, with new £64m striker Gyokeres scoring the opening goal, and Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz also on target.
""I am very happy with what I see,"" said Arteta. ""I think, individually, there was some big performances against a Champions League opponent. It's a good feeling.
""That first goal is always very important and the way he [Gyokeres] took it as well, was really, really good.
""We are developing certain connections with the new players. It was very good. Kai came in and I think the goal he scored was top, as well.""
Arsenal have been playing a more direct style of football during pre-season - something Arteta hopes will complement Gyokeres' style of play.
""That's his nature,"" said Arteta. ""I think everything that he does - his movement, the way he times his runs, the way he predicts the next move, where the space can be and where the ball is going to land - that's the instinct that he has.
""That's why he's scored so many goals in the last few seasons, so that's not a coincidence, it's his ability and he's constantly looking for it.
""I think he pins both centre-backs. He's a player that, when you leave him with the space one against one, he's going to destroy you.
""So he's going to create a lot of space as well for us and there is the moment that, in any situation, there is a player there that can score a goal.""
