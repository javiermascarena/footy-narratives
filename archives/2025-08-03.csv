Newcastle negotiating Sesko deal with Leipzig amid Man Utd interest,Talks are continuing between Newcastle and RB Leipzig over the structure of a deal which would take striker Benjamin Sesko to St James' Park.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13405500/benjamin-sesko-newcastle-make-formal-bid-for-rb-leipzig-forward-with-manchester-united-also-keen-on-striker,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 10:14:00",,['Manchester United'],"Talks are continuing between Newcastle and RB Leipzig over the structure of a deal which would take striker Benjamin Sesko to St James' Park.
The Magpies made a formal offer for the forward, which Sky Sports News understands was worth €75m (£65.5m) plus €5m (£4.3m) in add-ons. This offer hasn't been accepted or rejected, as discussions go on about the payment terms. Sesko's agent travelled to Leipzig on Saturday night for these talks.
In another development, Manchester United were also in discussions with RB Leipzig on Saturday night about Sesko and depending on how those talks progressed, they will decide whether to make a bid.
Newcastle have presented their vision to the Slovenian striker. The player is open to both projects.
Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has reportedly told his team-mates that he will be leaving.
The bid comes with Newcastle braced for a second offer from Liverpool for Alexander Isak.
Marcel Schafer, RB Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko on Saturday.
""We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,"" he said.
Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.
Sesko remains a top target for Manchester United. It was thought the club would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker.
While the priority is to offload players, it is understood they can buy before selling provided there are sales before the window closes.
It is understood RB Leipzig are interested in Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan.
Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe confirmed the club rejected a bid from Liverpool for Isak, but is unsure on what will happen next.
Sky Sports News understands Liverpool's opening offer for Isak was £110m plus add-ons. However, the total offer did not reach £120m. Newcastle are braced for a second offer.
Isak is due back in Newcastle on Saturday following his personal training camp in Spain.
The Newcastle striker has been training at Real Sociedad's training headquarters on his own, after refusing to travel with Newcastle on their pre-season tour of Asia.
Isak reported a thigh injury and travelled to San Sebastián to recover with his own staff.
Eddie Howe said on Saturday morning in South Korea that he found out Isak had travelled to Spain via the media.
""From my situation I am very much removed from what was happening back home,"" Howe said in a press conference ahead of facing Tottenham on Sunday in South Korea.
""I was made aware of a bid yesterday and that bid was turned down all before I even heard about it. People back in England are dealing with the situation.
""I really don't know what happens next. From our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.
""It is difficult because you don't know what is going to happen. There can be all sorts of talk and hypothetical situations but then you are dealing with reality.
""The reality is we had the first bid from Liverpool yesterday. I believe that was turned down, from this point onwards let's see what happens.
""I have no idea to try to predict that. In terms of trying to upset players, from my perspective, we can only talk about us, we try to do things the right way, signing players is always complex, we just try to do what we think is right. I can't talk about other clubs, that is not for me to say.""
Howe has added Newcastle are only ""looking for the best"" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.
Not only have the Magpies been hit with Isak's desire to leave, but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.
Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back.
With Callum Wilson departing earlier this summer, it leaves just Will Osula as their only recognised first-team striker on their pre-season tour of Asia.
""We're looking for the best players that we can get,"" said Howe. ""Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us.
""I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.
""It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change til the window shuts.""
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

Isak lands back in Newcastle after Liverpool bid rejected,Alexander Isak has landed back in Newcastle following his personal training camp in Spain - a day after a bid from Liverpool of over &#163;100m was rejected by the Magpies.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13405595/alexander-isak-transfer-news-newcastle-striker-due-back-at-club-on-saturday-after-liverpool-bid-of-over-100m-rejected,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 13:00:00",,['Liverpool'],"Alexander Isak has landed back in Newcastle following his personal training camp in Spain - a day after a bid from Liverpool of over £100m was rejected by the Magpies.
The striker flew into Newcastle on Saturday afternoon having trained at his former club Real Sociedad's headquarters on his own, after refusing to join Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia.
Isak reported a thigh injury and travelled to San Sebastian to recover with his own staff.
Sky Sports News understands Liverpool's opening offer for Isak on Friday was £110m plus add-ons. However, the total offer did not reach £120m.
Newcastle do not want to sell, and value Isak at £150m. On Saturday morning, Newcastle made a £70m offer to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko as they attempt to line up a replacement for Isak, should he leave.
Marcel Schafer, RB Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed on Saturday that clubs have made approaches for Sesko, who is also wanted by Manchester United.
""We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,"" said Schafer.
The rest of the Newcastle squad are due back from their pre-season tour of Asia on Monday.

Howe revealed that he only found out about Isak training in Spain through the media and not from the player himself.
""I know where he is now - through the media,"" said Howe. ""So I think from that perspective, it is difficult to go into any type of detail.""
The 25-year-old has informed Newcastle that he wants to explore his options in this transfer window after Liverpool previously made an informal approach for him.
Liverpool play at Newcastle in the Premier League - live on Sky Sports - on August 25 on Monday Night Football.
Sky Sports Data Editor Adam Smith:
Alexander Isak scored 23 goals in the Premier League last season - second only to Mohamed Salah.
The Sweden international also outperformed his expected goals (20.42), underlining his elite-level finishing and composure in front of goal.
The 25-year-old consistently finds space around the penalty spot, where he converts a high proportion of his shots. But he's far more than a poacher: six of his 36 efforts from outside the box found the net - demonstrating his range and technique.
The chart below benchmarks Isak's per-90 stats against other strikers in Europe's top five leagues. He excels across a wide spectrum - from goalscoring and dribbling, to opposition-box entries and link-up play.
Newcastle have made a formal bid to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko.
Sky Sports News understands the offer is €75m (£65.5m) plus €5m (£4.3m) in add-ons - which matches Leipzig's valuation.
Newcastle have presented their vision to the Slovenian striker and want the deal to happen.
Sesko is considering his options with Manchester United also at the table. The player is open to both projects and remains a top target for Manchester United.

Man Utd striker Hojlund available for £30m,Manchester United are prepared to sell Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gzx7ndy9zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 23:01:14",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United are prepared to sell striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30m.
The Denmark striker scored twice against Bournemouth in Chicago on Wednesday.
Immediately after the game he sought out waiting journalists to say his intention was to remain at United despite their ongoing interest in signing RB Leipzig's Slovenia forward Benjamin Sesko.
However, the situation is not quite so straightforward.
Newcastle are also keen on Sesko but are yet to strike a deal with RB Leipzig for the 22-year-old.
United are waiting to decide their next move and there have been reports that the player would prefer to switch to Old Trafford.
United sources are adamant they could do a deal before selling players.
But it is accepted that there would have to be exits to ensure they remain compliant with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules.
And, if Sesko arrived, Hojlund would be marginalised.
If Hojlund was sold for £30m, it would effectively be a loss for United given the forward's 'book value' is £43m as he is two years into the five-year contract he signed.
United have spent almost £130m this summer on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.

'Like being with a rock star' - departing Son's 10 years at Spurs,"Son Heung-min, who has announced he is leaving Tottenham, will always be ""worshipped"" by Spurs fans, says club legend Micky Hazard.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg717kk8p8xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 09:06:34",Neil Johnston,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"""I'm not sure we'll see another Sonny at Tottenham,"" Kevin Wimmer, Son Heung-min's close friend and former Spurs team-mate, tells BBC Sport.
""To be at one club - especially one as big as Spurs - for 10 years in this day and age is a very special achievement.""
After 454 appearances and 173 goals, Son is moving to pastures new a decade after Mauricio Pochettino brought him to north London from Bayer Leverkusen.
The South Korea forward was the most expensive Asian signing in the Premier League when the then 23-year-old arrived in 2015 in a deal reportedly worth £22.5m.
Now aged 33, Son leaves three months after writing his name in Spurs folklore by helping the team to victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final to end the club's 17-year wait for a major trophy.
""We love players who give so much to this club,"" Micky Hazard, an FA Cup (1982) and Uefa Cup (1984) winner with Spurs, says.
""Sonny will always be worshipped in these parts.""
On the pitch, Son will be remembered by Spurs fans for his searing pace and outstanding moments like his wonderful solo goal in 2019, when Tottenham's number seven was too quick for Burnley as he ran all the way from the edge of his own penalty area, dodging tackle after tackle, before slotting past Nick Pope.
Off it, he will be remembered by team-mates for his incredible gestures.
Son paid the bill when he took the team out for a Korean barbecue during Tottenham's pre-season tour of South Korea in 2022 before giving the whole travelling party personal gifts to mark their visit to his home country.
""When he first arrived, I didn't know much about him,"" Hazard tells BBC Sport.
""Ten years on, he's leaving a Spurs legend.""
'Welcome to Seoul'
Son had already rejected Pochettino before joining the Argentine at Tottenham and embarking on a 10-year love affair with Spurs.
In 2013, Pochettino had just taken charge of Southampton when he met with the then 20-year-old - who was already making a name for himself with Hamburg - his father, Son Woong-jung, and his agent.
Pochettino tried to convince Son that Saints, then in the Premier League, would be the ideal place to continue his football education, but the player moved to Bayer Leverkusen instead where he spent two years before finally linking up with Pochettino, who had been appointed Spurs boss 15 months earlier.
Yet he struggled to settle in his early days in London and asked to leave, external less than a year into a five-year contract before deciding to stay and fight for his place.
A decade after arriving, Son leaves with a Europa League winners' medal - as well as a sackful of individual prizes, including the 2021-22 Premier League Golden Boot, which he shared with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah after both players scored 23 times, and the Fifa Puskas award (presented to the scorer of the ""most beautiful"" goal of the calendar year) for that run and finish against Burnley in 2019.
""Everything about that goal is a symbol of how he plays the game,"" adds Hazard.
There have been crushing disappointments too, like defeat by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League final, and losing to Manchester City in the 2021 EFL Cup final.
In 2019, he apologised for his tackle on Andre Gomes which left the Everton midfielder with a horrific ankle injury and which resulted in the visibly upset Son being sent off.
Yet the individual awards have continued to flow.
Four Premier League player of the month prizes, two-time winner of goal of the month, three-time Tottenham player of the year... the list goes on.
A fierce competitor on the pitch, Spurs supporters have warmed to Son's 'Mr Nice Guy' image off it.
After Tottenham defeated West Ham in the EFL Cup in 2021, a young fan managed to get on the pitch and ran towards the player before being surrounded by stewards.
The boy was being escorted away when Son caught up with him, took off his shirt, and handed it to the youngster.
A few minutes before Tottenham's squad touched down in the South Korean capital Seoul for a pre-season tour three years ago, hundreds of fans who had gathered at Incheon Airport started screaming in surprise as Son suddenly appeared to welcome his team-mates visiting his home country.
The player, who was already in South Korea on holiday, held up a 'Welcome to Seoul' sign with the Spurs badge on it and waved to his team-mates as they made their way out of the arrivals terminal.
""I was actually at Incheon Airport that day,"" Sungmo Lee, South Korean football journalist and author, tells BBC Sport.
""When Son appeared, the reaction was similar to how fans greet Oasis and Coldplay when they step on stage.""
'Sonmania - like being with a rock star'
Son is big news in South Korea.
Actually, that's not quite true. Son is huge news.
""There has been research about who has the best brand value among all South Korean people, and Son is almost always in top three along with top K-pop stars like BTS and Blackpink,"" adds Sungmo Lee.
""One of the reasons for that is South Korean people regard him as the national treasure and pride of the country.""
In South Korea, there are regular television programmes that are simply compilations of Son's best goals and assists, while a Son icon appears above the scoreboard to denote he is playing during live broadcasts of Tottenham matches in the country.
His face beams from giant billboards advertising anything from clothes to ice cream, and Son's picture has also appeared on the side of the capital's buses promoting tourism.
In Son's hometown of Chuncheon, about 50 miles from Seoul and where a football academy has been set up by the player and his family, there is a huge mural in his honour.
England right-back Kyle Walker, who played for Tottenham between 2009-2017, recalls a promotional visit to Seoul with Son soon after Spurs finished runners-up to Premier League champions Chelsea at the end of 2016-17.
Former Austria centre-back Wimmer and Wales defender Ben Davies joined the trip to meet sponsors and a thriving Spurs fanbase, which had grown significantly since Son signed.
""I've never seen anything like it,"" Walker, who spent eight years in north London before joining Manchester City in 2017, said on his 'You'll Never Beat Kyle Walker' podcast.
""We'd do an appearance and then we'd have to use decoy vehicles to get away because fans would try and stop the traffic. They all wanted to catch a glimpse of Sonny.
""They'd come back to the hotel where we were staying and all night they'd sit outside. It was incredible.
""I've seen it before to a certain degree with Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard and David Beckham. But it was nothing compared to Sonny.""
Wimmer, who has stayed in touch with Son since leaving Spurs in 2017, likened it to ""being in the company of a rock star"".
""I was always joking with him about this,"" he says.
""I said: 'You are the most famous guy in South Korea', but he was like: 'No, no, it's not so special'.""
Former Austria defender Wimmer had arrived at White Hart Lane from Cologne in the summer of 2015, three months before Son.
""I knew of him because, like me, he was playing in the Bundesliga,"" adds Wimmer.
The pair struck up an instant friendship in London.
In their early days at Tottenham, they would often speak German together while they improved their English.
After a win at Southampton in 2016, Son and Wimmer interviewed one another - in English - for Spurs TV.
""Kev, why are you my best friend?"" asks Son.
Wimmer replies: ""Because you are a wonderful guy, an honest guy. It's always funny with you and I hope we stay together for many more years here.""
Within a year, Wimmer had been sold to Stoke for £18m. Son stayed to become a Spurs great.
'Now I'm a legend'
In the space of two years Spurs have lost Harry Kane - their all-time top scorer with 280 goals in 435 appearances - and now Son.
Following Kane's departure to Bayern Munich in August 2023, Son stepped up by scoring 17 goals and adding 10 assists in 35 Premier League appearances as Spurs finished fifth in 2023-24.
However, Son scored just seven goals and provided nine assists in his 30 Premier League appearances in 2024-25. He also endured an injury-hit end to the season and was restricted to a 67th-minute substitute appearance in the Europa League final.
Four days after beating Manchester United in a European final, great names from Tottenham's past formed a guard of honour for soon-to-depart manager Ange Postecoglou's side before the home game with Brighton on the final day of the season.
Ossie Ardiles, Pat Jennings, Keith Burkinshaw and Martin Chivers were among those who lined up on the pitch - along with Hazard.
""Sonny came up to each and every one of us, shook our hands, and said: 'Now I'm a legend',"" adds former Spurs midfielder Hazard.
""Despite everything he achieved in 10 years at Spurs, he still didn't believe he was a legend until he won a trophy. I think there is something special about that, something beautiful. It says so much about his character.""
Wimmer, who now plays for Slovan Bratislava in Slovakia, messaged his friend immediately after the final in Bilbao to congratulate him on helping Spurs win a first major European trophy since 1984.
""Out of hundreds of messages he received that night, Sonny still took time to get back to me,"" he says. ""I was so pleased Sonny was finally able to get his hands on a trophy.""
National service to national treasure
Spurs are supported by 12 million - almost one in four - South Koreans, according to research commissioned by AIA, the Asia-based insurance firm which is the club's shirt-front sponsor.
""Son is a pride of whole nation,"" says Sungmo Lee.
""He already proved himself to win the Golden Boot in the Premier League, which was regarded as impossible for an Asian player.""
Son made front page news in 2020 when he travelled back to his home country for compulsory national service.
The player spent three weeks with the South Korean Military Corps, where he finished among the top five performers.
""It was big news and one of the reasons why Korean people love him even more,"" adds Sungmo Lee. ""The training included firing guns. He got the award for being among the best trainees out of 157 he trained with.""
Will Son's departure hit Tottenham's revenue streams?
On matchdays at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, up to 700 Son shirts are sold - the most of any player - because of the increasing number of fans travelling from South Korea to watch their hero in action.
""They tend to be wealthy fans with disposable income,"" football finance expert Kieran Maguire tells BBC Sport. ""They don't just buy one Son shirt, they're coming away with two carrier bags full of stuff with Son's name on the back.""
Maguire believes there could be a ""small"" impact on Tottenham's finances now Son  has announced he is leaving.
""While it will be a blow for Spurs fans in terms of memories because Son has been a magnificent player for them, the difference between finishing 16th and 17th in the table (Spurs finished 17th last season) is £3.5m.
""Over the course of the season, that's more important than shirt sales from one player.""
So what does the future look like for Son, who is in advanced negotiations with Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC.
""On several occasions, including his interview with the Korean media in 2024, he has said he won't be a football manager and won't be staying in football after his retirement,"" adds Sungmo Lee.
""He also said, for that reason, he wishes to continue his football career for as long as possible.""
Whatever he decides to do when he stops playing, Son's memory will live on at Tottenham and beyond.
""No-one will ever forget Sonny,"" adds Wimmer.

Mbeumo to make Man Utd debut but uncertainty over Sesko pursuit,Bryan Mbeumo will make his Manchester United debut against Everton on Sunday but uncertainty hangs over the club's pursuit of Benjamin Sesko.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx27pkd7074o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 11:00:09",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Bryan Mbeumo will make his Manchester United debut against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday but uncertainty hangs over the club's pursuit of RB Leipzig frontman Benjamin Sesko.
Along with Matheus Cunha, Mbeumo is part of a £130m summer outlay by United but his first appearance was delayed while he got to the same fitness levels as his new team-mates, a result of his former club Brentford beginning pre-season training a week after Ruben Amorim's squad.
Amorim confirmed ""he is going to play"", when asked if Mbeumo would feature against Everton in the final match of the three-game Premier League Summer Series.
""I'm really excited to see him play and what he can give to our team,"" said the United head coach.
United's overall summer outlay is a surprise given minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said in March the club could have ""gone bust by Christmas"" without the huge cuts implemented to slash costs.
Club sources cite a number of reasons - including Marcus Rashford's £325,000-a-week salary being fully covered during his loan move to Barcelona, various sell-on clauses that have been activated this summer and the payment schedules agreed with Wolves and Brentford around Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - as the reason why they can still spend.
United sources had said on Friday their attempts to sign Sesko were continuing.
However, subsequently, reports have emerged in the forward's native Slovenia stating the forward had chosen to join Newcastle. Neither club has commented officially on the latest reports.
Yet, it is accepted even if Sesko did arrive in a move that would take the club's overall spend to about £200m, there will still be issues for Amorim to address, chief among them the goalkeeper.
It now seems certain Andre Onana will remain as Amorim's first choice.
The Cameroon international has been working hard on his fitness in the United States after hurting his hamstring on the second day of pre-season training.
He is unlikely to be involved against Everton but there is hope Onana could play some part in the final friendly against a Fiorentina side including former United keeper David de Gea at Old Trafford on 9 August.
""We are always looking to improve the team and we have some characteristics we would like to have. But it depends on the market and depends on sales,"" said Amorim.
""You can see the goalkeepers. Tom [Heaton] is leaner, Altay [Bayindir] did really well and [Andre] Onana is going to be better like the other guys that are getting better this year.""

Inside Arsenal's tour of Singapore and Hong Kong,BBC Sport football news reporter Alex Howell analyses Arsenal's pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4glwdqvgp5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 11:00:04",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have completed their pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong and return to England hoping the preparations will help them win their first trophy since 2020.
Plans for this pre-season heavily involved manager Mikel Arteta. He was across the idea to put on the voluntary player training camp in June, before the full group travelled to Spain and on to Asia.
The Gunners were decimated by injuries last year and Arteta has spoken previously about how too long a break means the players break down when exposed to physical stress after a period of rest. The camps were designed to get them to a high level as soon as possible.
The pre-season work seemed to have the desired effect and all three of the Gunners' opponents mentioned Arsenal's level of performance, while Arteta himself believes there has been a click.
The pressure to win a trophy is not something the club are shying away from - centre-back Gabriel Magalhaes referenced it in interviews, as did Arteta in his first news conference of the tour - alongside huge posters showing the slogan 'ready for new heights' at the away kit launch in Singapore.
Arsenal have been busy early in the transfer market, with six new signings made before the tour was over. Only winger Noni Madueke, who was given time off after playing for Chelsea in the Club World Cup, was left at home to go on holiday.
This is sporting director Andrea Berta's first transfer window with Arsenal and he has impressed those inside the club with his relentless work ethic.
The signings - and how the club could improve the squad - was planned last season, with Arteta scrapping his 'tier status' system.
'Tier one' players were guaranteed starters but, given the demands of the football calendar, the manager is doing things differently.
Madueke's signing is the perfect example. The England international, 23, was signed for £48.5m with the thought that if Bukayo Saka is unavailable, the drop-off to bringing in another player is not significant enough to affect the team.
It also allows the club to protect Saka and manage his game time in a season that could feature up to 65 games leading up to a World Cup.
Straight back to it
Pre-season tours are demanding of players on and off the pitch.
There was a regular Adidas presence around the team hotel as commercial activities, events, kit launches and fan activities were planned during the 12-day tour.
The squad did get downtime for golf and a couple of evenings out in Singapore, with players heading to a bar in the Marina Bay Area after the win over Newcastle.
The open training sessions - held so supporters could see more of their favourite players in action - were conducted in stadiums where the matches would be played.
However, the main part of the work was done in the day, with the players coming up against the coaching staff in sessions.
This is done deliberately by Arteta. The manager does not like giving away insights to his opposition, even in pre-match news conferences.
Players facing the coaches was done so that there is not a first and a second team - and the two groups of players who were lined up in the sessions were doing the same thing.
The under-21s, and some other young players, are not on the tour so the coaches took their places as the opposition.
The striker to change the club's fortunes
The biggest moment of the tour was the unveiling of striker Viktor Gyokeres, who arrived for a deal worth up to £64m.
Such was Arteta's desire to get Gyokores with the team as soon as possible, the Swedish striker travelled to Singapore on a commercial flight alongside sporting director Berta to arrive before kick-off for the friendly against Newcastle.
It was an interesting dynamic - Gyokeres and the staff were interested to see how the team would react to him and his arrival.
It is felt Gyokeres has both the physical and mental capacity to deal with the pressure that comes with being Arsenal's number nine - while also wearing the 14 shirt worn by the club's all-time leading goalscorer Thierry Henry.
Arteta spoke to him in the tunnel following the 3-2 victory, while the striker also spoke with former Brighton team-mate Ben White.
Changes implemented in games
In the matches Arsenal played on the tour there was a visible change in the way they played.
Arteta is highly competitive and sees friendlies as tests.
The tempo of play so far seems to be higher, as does the intention to play the ball forward more quickly.
There are also signs of how the team is going to progress - Ethan Nwaneri played the first two matches in the centre, a sign that that is where Arsenal see his future after a breakthrough season on the right.
Against Newcastle, the direct style was on show, as well as an ability to deal with the physical challenge of Eddie Howe's side.
Arsenal have again made a point of recruiting players who are physical. Gyokeres, Christian Norgaard and Cristhian Mosquera are all strong players and Martin Zubimendi's stature has been noticed by those around the club.
They will play up to Gyokeres and make use of his imposing physical style, along with his ability to seemingly burst through centre-backs.
There was an emphasis on goal threat - particularly against Newcastle. Arsenal were breaking lines quicker, using runs in behind the defence and getting shots off.
This is all part of a plan to increase goal threats from every position and get the best out of Gyokeres' key attributes.

The excitement around 15-year-old Max Dowman has been building for a long time, but the club are being cautious with him because of his age and the pressures that come with top-level football.
Dowman's physical output in training and in youth games is on par with the rest of the senior professionals in the Arsenal squad.
Arsenal know they have a highly talented player on their hands but are still aware that Dowman needs to be eased into scenarios to see how he reacts to the physical challenges of elite football.
Dowman replaced Saka in all three friendlies - a role that will mostly be taken by Madueke once he gets up to speed.
However, he looked threatening every time - winning a penalty against Newcastle -and a full competitive debut looks likely this season.

Tottenham need to find a way to capitalise on legacy of trailblazer Son | John Duerden,"The first Asian to become a genuine Premier League star, Son Heung-min raised Spurs’ profile in the region. Now they must kick on without him",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/03/tottenham-need-to-find-a-way-to-capitalise-on-legacy-of-trailblazer-son,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 07:00:34",John Duerden,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Just as opposing fans in the Premier League have experienced feelings of dread over the past decade when Son Heung-min picked up the ball on the edge of their area, there had been a summer of worry among his millions of followers in Asia that his time in England was coming to an end.
As the South Korean’s legs slowed last season, reports of a move elsewhere gathered pace. His 10 years at Tottenham may have ended with a trophy, the Europa League in May, but the legacy had been in place for some time. The 33-year-old has changed the way Asian players are perceived around the world and much more besides.
“It was the most difficult decision I have made in my career,” an emotional Son said at a Seoul press conference on Saturday before Sunday’s pre-season exhibition against Newcastle. “Such amazing memories. It was so hard to make the decision. I need a new environment to push myself. I need a little bit of change – 10 years is a long time. I came to north London as a kid, 23 years old, such a young age. I leave this club as a grown man, a very proud man.”
Son has been the pride of Asian football for years, the first player from the continent to become a genuine Premier League star, a legend at his club. There had been compatriot Park Ji-sung who won titles and respect during seven years at Manchester United, but he was never an automatic starter and, unfairly for a technically excellent and intelligent player, old Three Lungs was praised more for his running, work-rate and stamina.
Shinji Kagawa looked like he may reach the next level at Old Trafford but was soon back in Germany. So it was Son, signed from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015, who went on to appear on billboards in north London, Seoul and a lot of cities in between as one of the best-known faces of the world’s best-known league.
There were 173 goals in 454 competitive games, including the 2020 Puskás Award for that strike against Burnley. In the 2021-2022 season, he scored 23 in the league, sharing the golden boot with Mohamed Salah, another milestone for Asian football.
When Harry Kane left Spurs for Bayern Munich, Son stayed and was made captain, and while last season was a relative struggle, for team and player, it ended on a high. Some thought he may stay for one more crack at the Champions League, after doing so much to help Spurs to the final in 2019, but it was not to be.
In 2022, I went to Tottenham’s sparkling training ground on the northern outskirts of the capital to present the Chuncheon-born native with the Best Footballer in Asia award, a trophy handed out by Titan Sports in China, a country that is not known for its love of Korean football but one that has the utmost respect for Elder Brother Son.
He had received the prize in all but three of the 12 years since it became a thing. We discussed our favourite food from his homeland while he tried not to laugh at the Korean language attempts of Hugo Lloris in the next room as the goalkeeper recorded a video message to fans in the Land of the Morning Calm before the club’s visit a few weeks later.
Tottenham are there once more. “It’s very clear that Sonny will start and lead the team out as captain,” the new Tottenham manager Thomas Frank said. “If that is the last game for Sonny, what a place to do it here in front of his home fans. It could be a beautiful ending.”
And an emotional one. His Premier League performances will be missed in Korea, not least by those bars that hang huge televisions in their windows, showing Tottenham games with a tiny image of his smiling face in the top corner of the screen to show their idol is on the field.
Playing time is a big thing for Korean fans after most of Son’s predecessors struggled. Park Chu-young joined Arsenal in 2011 but managed just seven league minutes in the red and white corner of north London, inactivity that caused some resentment back home. Son’s experience was the opposite. Playing regularly, becoming a star for so long and then captain at a major club also helped grow Tottenham’s global fanbase.
While European estimates of their fans in Asia are unconfirmed, it was claimed in 2022 that there were more than 12 million Spurs supporters in Korea.
Whatever the accuracy of that number, there has never been such a popular player – Son has advertised more than 30 brands in his homeland – to play in such a popular league for such a length of time.
Tottenham will need to find a way to build on his legacy in Korea and the rest of Asia. For now, though, they just have to find a way to live without Son on the pitch. And fans of the player on the world’s biggest continent will also have to get used to Premier League action without the forward.
A Chinese journalist once said that Son showed the world that Asia can produce a player as exciting as any from Africa or South America. As legacies go, that’s pretty good.

Manchester United’s ‘Wembley of the North’ stadium plan hits the buffers,Talks deadlocked over asking price of rail terminal site,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/02/manchester-uniteds-wembley-of-the-north-stadium-plan-hit-by-delays,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 19:00:19",Matt Hughes,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United’s plans to build a 100,000-seat stadium next to Old Trafford are facing delays due to a standoff over the price of land needed to begin work on the construction of the proposed ground Sir Jim Ratcliffe has called “the Wembley of the North”. The club want land used as a rail freight terminal to complete the Old Trafford Regeneration Project, which they claim will bring £7.3bn a year to the UK economy.
United have held talks with Freightliner, the haulage company that owns and operates the terminal, about buying the land, but negotiations are deadlocked due to a disagreement over the price.
While Freightliner is understood to have expressed a willingness to relocate from Trafford Park to nearby St Helens, the company is seeking around £400m for the land, with United valuing it at between £40m and £50m. Ratcliffe has made it clear United are unwilling to accept the asking price set by Freightliner’s parent company, Brookfield, and initial discussions are believed to have reached an impasse.
A source said Freightliner “have United over a barrel”. The company is willing to relocate to a proposed new site that would offer increased capacity for trains, but it is in no rush to move. The club’s view is that Freightliner will only receive what would be a significant windfall if they are willing to drop the asking price.
When unveiling designs for the Old Trafford master plan, produced by Foster + Partners, in March, Ratcliffe set an ambitious target of completing what he described as a five-year build by 2030. United had been hoping to begin preparatory building work by the end of this year, but failing to secure the Freightliner site will delay the start date.
United’s options at this stage would be to increase their offer, wait for Freightliner to lower its demands, or scale back the project so that the freight terminal land is not required. It is also possible the new Old Trafford Mayoral Development Corporation, chaired by Sebastian Coe, could issue a compulsory purchase order, although that would be subject to legal challenges and would lead to further delays.
Completion by 2030 was always seen as an ambitious target outside the senior leadership team at Old Trafford, given United have yet to obtain planning permission, secure ownership of all the land required or formally appoint architects. While Foster + Partners produced the artist impressions and videos of the proposed new stadium, the club plan to run a formal tender process to appoint architects.
At a Fans Forum event on 30 June, United conceded that securing the land required could prove an obstacle to beginning work this year. United were asked by supporters whether building would commence in 2025 or 2026 and responded: “Planning work is continuing, including the consultations with fans discussed during today’s meeting.
“Discussions are also ongoing with local authorities, land owners and potential funding partners with a view to securing the land and the finance we need to proceed with the project. It remains our ambition to proceed with the project as quickly as possible, but we can only do this once the necessary land and funding is in place.”
United have estimated the cost of the project at £4.2bn, but claim it will bring huge social and economic benefits to the local community and wider region, including 92,000 jobs, more than 17,000 new homes as well as attracting an extra 1.8 million visitors annually.
The cost for the stadium has been projected by United to be around £2bn, although given the tented roof alone is likely to cost £300m, industry sources say £3bn is a more realistic budget. Freightliner’s demands for £400m could result in the redevelopment being significantly over budget from the start.
United are not seeking any public money to build the stadium itself. The club declined to comment on a private commercial negotiation.

"After 17 years at the top, a tough job is taking a toll on Pep Guardiola | Jonathan Wilson","Manchester City manager may still relish a title chase but, as the declines of Mourinho and Wenger prove, nothing lasts for ever",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/02/17-years-tough-job-taking-pep-guardiola,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 19:00:18",Jonathan Wilson,"['Liverpool', 'Manchester City']","Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the interview Pep Guardiola gave to GQ was how tired he sounded. The headlines that he was contemplating a 15-year break from the game didn’t entirely reflect what he said – “I don’t know how long I’ll stop for: a year, two years, three years, five, 10, 15, I don’t know. But I will leave after this spell with City because I need to stop and focus on myself, on my body” – but his weariness was clear.
To an extent it is not a surprise. Jürgen Klopp was exhausted (and self-aware) enough after almost 15 seasons at Dortmund and Liverpool (plus seven at Mainz) to quit last summer. There were times last season, particularly in that four-month spell either side of Christmas when City’s form dipped alarmingly, that Guardiola seemed shattered. By his own admission, his decision last November to sign a contract extension to summer 2027 was motivated in part by guilt at the downturn. “The problems we had in the last month, I felt now was not the right time to leave,” he said. The problems got much worse.
To which there can be two reactions. On the one hand, it is rare and admirable that a manager should feel such a sense of responsibility to his club. While many are sacked before they have a chance to resolve problems, there are also plenty happy enough to walk away with a pay-off and pass the crisis on to somebody else. But on the other hand, it probably is not a great sign if a manager with two years left on his contract is already looking forward to the extended holiday he is going to have when it is all over.
But management is exhausting. It was striking in the interview that the element Guardiola picked out as most debilitating was having opposing fans chanting he was going to be sacked in the morning, the sort of mundane banter that it is easy to assume just washes off managers as experienced and successful as Guardiola. Beyond that, though, it is useful to be reminded just how tough a job management is and it may be getting even tougher.
Over the course of his two autobiographies, it becomes clear how relentless Brian Clough found the grind of management: there was no time to enjoy a victory on Saturday, he said, before he was having to start thinking about the game on Wednesday. That was before the calendar was as packed as it is now and Clough was somebody quite happy to pop over to Mallorca for a holiday during the season, somebody who was noted even at the time for the infrequency of his appearances on the training pitch.
Managers today have far more help than they used to. They have specialist coaches and analysts, and their job, at least at the top level, is focused largely on preparing the team. With one or two exceptions, transfers and long-term strategy is the responsibility of a sporting director.
But still, it is an often thankless role where successes are quickly forgotten and a few bad weeks can lead to the sack. Guardiola, for all he may have disliked the banter from opposing fans, at least had enough credit in the bank not to fear that.
And he is right; there is perhaps no other job somebody faces such unending scrutiny, such vocal criticism, from people who, frankly, know far less about it than they do (and, yes, that includes journalists, and no, that does not mean all criticism is necessarily misguided).
Guardiola has spoken with a degree of enthusiasm about the challenge of rebuilding City. Given he has a naturally sarcastic tone, it is never entirely easy to tell, but that can probably be taken at face value. One of the problems for a manager who has been in a job for an extended time, particularly when they have been as successful as Guardiola, is finding new challenges. Building a team to win the league is invigorating, stimulating, exciting, setting it going again to win again less so.
The comedian Stewart Lee wrote in his autobiography about how on long tours he would deliberately lose part of his audience because of the kick he got from winning it back; it is not to suggest Guardiola would have chosen to be in this position to say he may relish the challenge of restoring City to the title.
There is another factor, which is that very few managers remain at the very highest level for much more than a decade. Sir Alex Ferguson is an obvious counter-example, 20 years separating his first title at Manchester United from his last, even after his successes with Aberdeen, but he is an outlier who skews expectations. Arrigo Sacchi’s peak lasted about four years. Even José Mourinho was probably already past his best when he won his last league title, at Chelsea in 2014-15, 12 years after his first, at Porto.
Every game Guardiola has taken charge of since he was appointed at Barcelona in 2008 has been dissected. For 17 years – less his year off in New York – opponents have been looking for ways to stymy his attacking plans and defensive vulnerabilities. Match footage has been pored over, data crunched. Part of Guardiola’s genius has been to keep evolving, to remain ahead of his pursuers.
That has always happened, but never to the same extent as today. Teams have never been worked out so quickly; what might have taken a season 50 years ago now happens in a couple of weeks. To stay ahead is to adapt constantly and that is exhausting. There comes a point when the energy almost visibly leaves a manager, as it did with Mourinho, as it did with Arsène Wenger, and, unable to stay in front of the pack any longer, they lapse into self-parody.
Guardiola is not there yet. Managerial arcs rarely end in a cliff edge; it is not that they are suddenly finished. But no career can go on for ever upwards. After 17 years at the top, as he begins to feel the toll, it may be that the descent has begun. Which may still be enough to win City another league title, but nothing lasts for ever.

Howe admits Isak situation ‘far from ideal’ as Newcastle linked with Sesko,Newcastle reported to have made £65.5m Sesko offer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/02/newcastle-eddie-howe-alexander-isak-liverpool-transfer-football,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 13:42:23",Billy Munday,['Liverpool'],"Eddie Howe has admitted he does not know what is going to happen next after Liverpool had a bid for Alexander Isak turned down by Newcastle on Friday. The striker has made it clear he wants to leave this summer and is particularly keen on a move to Anfield.
Newcastle, meanwhile, are understood to have made an offer worth around €75m (£65.5m) for the RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. On Saturday, they announced the signing of the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale from Southampton on a season-long loan.
Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Isak rejected after their sporting director, Richard Hughes, made an enquiry about the Sweden international’s availability to Newcastle two weeks ago. Newcastle value Isak at £150m.
“I am very much removed from everything that is happening back home,” Howe said in Seoul, where Newcastle are due to play Tottenham on Sunday. “I was made aware there was a bid yesterday. That bid was turned down before I heard about it.
“There are people back in England dealing with the situation. I really don’t know what is going to happen next, but we still support Alex in every way. My wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.”
Isak has not been part of the club’s pre-season tour of Asia, which Newcastle said was due to a minor thigh injury. However, the 25-year-old has been training at his former club Real Sociedad in Spain this week.
“I know where he is through the media, so it’s difficult for me to go into any detail,” Howe said. “The situation is far from ideal. It is quite complex.”
Isak, who has scored more than 20 Premier League goals the past two seasons, has three years left on his contract. There has been no progress on a new contract for him.
Newcastle are yet to line up a replacement for Isak. They are reported to have made a formal bid of €75m (£65.5m) plus €5m in add-ons to RB Leipzig for Sesko. That is said to match Leipzig’s valuation, but Manchester United are also targeting the forward.
“We are looking for the best players that we can get,” Howe said, refusing to comment on Sesko individually. “Whatever our target position is, we’re looking for the best. That’s the only way we’re going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it’s quality over quantity. It always has been.”
Newcastle’s opening offer for Yoane Wissa was rejected by Brentford last month, while they were beaten to the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitiké by Liverpool. “It’s been a challenging summer,” Howe said. “We’ve missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons. But we’re still very competitive and we’re still in there trying to bring very good players to the club and that won’t change until the window shuts.”
Newcastle have endured a difficult pre-season with defeats to Celtic (4-0), Arsenal (3-2) and the K-League All Stars (1-0). The Denmark Under-21 striker Will Osula, who scored twice last season, started all three matches in Isak’s absence.
After facing Tottenham in Seoul, Newcastle will play Espanyol and Atlético Madrid at St James’ Park before starting their Premier League campaign at Aston Villa on 16 August.
Ramsdale arrives, Wilson joins West Ham
Newcastle have secured the signature of Aaron Ramsdale on loan from Southampton until the end of the season. In a World Cup year, the England goalkeeper has opted for a move away from the Championship side and will play under his former manager Howe at St James’ Park.
“Working with the manager and his coaching staff again were a big draw for me,” Ramsdale said. “They’ve already had a great influence on my career and the gaffer turned me from a man into a professional footballer at Bournemouth. He really showed me the ropes, so the manager and his coaching staff were a huge selling point for me to come here.”
The former Newcastle striker Callum Wilson, meanwhile, has signed for West Ham on a 12-month contract, having been released at the end of last season. The 33-year-old scored 49 goals in 130 appearances for the Magpies before his contract expired this summer.
“I’m excited to be joining a massive football club like West Ham,” said Wilson. “A club that shares a similar passion to mine: hard work, dedication, and also I strive for success so I’m glad to be a part of it.
“There’s such talent within the squad. And obviously the gaffer [Graham Potter] has come in now, he’s making everybody a team – all working in the same direction to achieve the goal which is to be finishing as high as possible in the league.”
