Amorim warns of 'surprise' if clubs leave bids to 'last minute' in transfer update,Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's wantaway players could have a future at the club if their transfer asking price is not met.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13401829/ruben-amorim-man-utd-head-coach-says-alejandro-garnacho-antony-jadon-sancho-tyrell-malacia-could-have-future-at-club,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:22:00",,['Manchester United'],"Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's wantaway players could have a future at the club if their transfer asking price is not met.
Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are exploring moves away from Old Trafford this summer.
Speaking on Friday ahead of their first Premier League Summer Series fixture against West Ham in the United States on Sunday, which is live on Sky Sports, Amorim insisted United won't sell the quartet for a cut-price fee and would reintegrate them into his squad if they are not sold.
Asked if the club was concerned about losing value on those players in order to sell them, Amorim said: ""That is not the case because there are different reasons for the players [wanting to leave]. Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.
""We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.
""I know for a fact Omar (Barrada, CEO) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.
""I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.""
United agreed the season-long loan of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona this week having brought in forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as Amorim looks to revamp his front line.
""At the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player,"" said Amorim. ""If we have to start the season with this squad, then I'm happy because all the players want to be here. That is the most important thing.
""With Bryan and Matheus, we are clearly a better team.""
United have always been in the market for a striker, but their focus is on player sales.
Amorim said: ""They (Mbeumo/Cunha) can play as a striker. We have Josh (Zirkzee) and Rasmus (Hojlund), the focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the position is there for them. They have to work. They have other players fighting for that position.
""I'm really pleased. They are really humble, that is really important, and they chose to be here. They had other options, Champions League options, they read everything people say about our club, but they chose to be here. That is a key point for me.""
Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been training separately from the first team and are not on the pre-season tour of the United States amid their wish to leave.
Aston Villa have been keen on Garnacho but Sky Sports News understands they are unable to meet their current asking price to buy him outright. Chelsea have a longstanding interest in him and he remains a target, but any more arrivals at Stamford Bridge are expected to be dependent on exits.
United are understood to believe Garnacho wants to remain in the Premier League.
Juventus' move for Sancho is on hold until sales are made after they signed Francisco Conceicao this week, according to Sky in Italy.
Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven while Antony thrived at Real Betis.
Sky Sports News reported on Friday that two of the Saudi Arabian Premier League's top clubs are understood to be interested in signing Antony.
A move to Real Betis is looking unrealistic at this stage of the window while several clubs from across Europe, including Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich, have been monitoring his situation.
Sancho and Malacia are both out of contract next year while Garnacho would represent a pure profit under the Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules after coming through the club's academy.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

Gyokeres gets green light to complete £63.8m Arsenal move,Viktor Gyokeres has been given clearance to complete his &#163;63.8m move to Arsenal after a total agreement was reached with Sporting.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13401655/viktor-gyokeres-transfer-news-striker-given-clearance-to-complete-arsenal-move-after-total-agreement-reached-with-sporting,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:20:00",,['Arsenal'],"Viktor Gyokeres has been given clearance to complete his £63.8m move to Arsenal after a total agreement was reached with Sporting.
The 27-year-old is expected to take a medical in London to finalise the move before flying out to join up with the squad for their pre-season tour of Asia.
Arsenal are set to pay a £55.1m (€63.5m) fixed fee plus £8.7m (€10m) in add-ons.
Sporting are expecting to receive £1.09m for every 20 matches Gyokeres plays for Arsenal with a limit of up to £4.36m and £430,000 for every 20 goals or assists he contributes up to £873,000.
Each time Arsenal qualify for the Champions League, Sporting are expecting to receive £873,000 up to a limit of £3.5m.
Negotiations around the bonuses dragged on for more than a week until there was a breakthrough earlier this week.
It is understood that Sporting were still analysing the contracts for much of Thursday before being satisfied there was a total agreement.
Sporting are believed to be satisfied that they will receive the full amount, as the add-ons are deemed to be easily achievable.
Gyokeres' agent waived his commission of around £5.6m to help talks progress over the guaranteed fee.
Arsenal play Newcastle in Singapore on Sunday and then face north London rivals Tottenham in Hong Kong on Thursday.
Mikel Arteta is keen to integrate all his new signings into the squad as soon as possible ahead of the new season.
Bringing in a striker has been a primary focus for Arsenal in this transfer window - they have explored conditions for a number of players, including RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
After joining Sporting from Coventry City for around £20m in 2023, Gyokeres has scored an incredible 97 goals in just 102 matches during his two seasons in the Portuguese capital.
Gyokeres netted 54 goals in only 52 games in all competitions last campaign, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, as he helped Sporting win the league and the Portuguese Cup.
A move to Arsenal sees Gyokeres return to English football, having joined Brighton & Hove Albion in January 2018, before moving to Coventry after loan spells at St Pauli and Swansea City.
Gyokeres scored 43 goals for Coventry in his two and a half seasons with the Championship side.
Gunners boss Arteta remained tight-lipped on his side's pursuit of Gyokeres ahead of Arsenal's pre-season game with Newcastle on Sunday in Singapore.
When asked about the Sweden forward said: ""You know I cannot talk about a player who is not ours yet.
""Whatever happens in the next few hours, I'm sure the club will make a statement about it.""
He did give some indication about whether any hypothetical signing - say a certain Sporting striker, for instance - might join up with the squad for the rest of the club's tour of the Far East, though.
""Yes, for sure,"" he said. ""Obviously, once we have finalised everything with a player, we want to integrate him with the team as quickly as possible.
""With Noni [Madueke], it was impossible because he needed some time [after the Club World Cup]. I think he's going to take a shorter vacation than he deserves because he wants to join us straightaway, as soon as we're back.
""I think immediately is better so they can start to join the team, get to know each other and get the ideas we want to put in their minds.""
For years, the football world called for Arsenal to sign a striker and the Gunners have finally responded. Viktor Gyokeres is on his way to the Emirates.
The move is set to be a standout one for the Premier League - no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting last season and it could herald the arrival of another elite goalscorer for the division.
But it is even more significant for Arsenal, given their spending under Mikel Arteta.
Read more on what Viktor Gyokeres can bring to Arsenal here...
Developments around Gyokeres come amid a busy summer of incomings at Arsenal.
They announced the signing of midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a £51m deal and another central midfielder, Christian Norgaard, arrived from Brentford for £15m.
Spaniard Kepa Arrizabalaga was signed for £5m from Chelsea, followed by a £52m deal for Noni Madueke.
And Arsenal have confirmed the signing of Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera in an initial £13m deal.

Bayern back in touch with Liverpool over Diaz,Bayern Munich are back in contact with Liverpool over a deal for Luis Diaz.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13401686/luis-diaz-transfer-news-bayern-munich-back-in-touch-with-liverpool-over-potential-transfer-for-winger,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 14:30:00",,['Liverpool'],"Bayern Munich are back in contact with Liverpool over a deal for Luis Diaz.
The German champions had a bid worth £58.5m rejected earlier this month but are not giving up on their pursuit of the winger.
Despite Liverpool's response being that Diaz is not for sale, it is understood Bayern's communication with the Premier League club has been persistent.
At this stage the two clubs are just in dialogue and there has been no formal offer from Bayern.
Liverpool's position on Diaz remains that he is an important player not just for the coming season but for the remainder of his contract, which has two years left to run.
The Anfield club are understood to have made that clear to all interested clubs, which has also included Barcelona this summer.
Liverpool's internal accounting of assets values Diaz at more than £86m (€100m+) and the club have not set a sale price because they do not want to.
Diaz has had interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia too - a market that also recently appeared to value Bruno Fernandes, who is two years older, at around £86.8m (€100m).
The Colombia international is understood to have been open to moving away from Anfield in the last two summer transfer windows but remained an important first-team player last season, scoring 13 goals in 36 Premier League appearances as Liverpool won the title.
Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher speaking at the start of May:
""It's an interesting one, where I think you could flip a coin with some people saying they'd love him to sign a new contract and some say it might be the time where you get good money for him because he's at a good age.
""I think Luis Diaz has been one of the best left wingers in the Premier League this season. I don't think he's quite Sadio Mane, so I think Liverpool supporters are actually still thinking, 'we haven't quite replaced Mane', but how many of them is there about?
""If I'm being honest, for the majority of this season up until Christmas, I was thinking you sell Diaz in the summer.
""The way he's played and the way Liverpool's front line might change, and with the fact that he can play through the middle in the manager's eyes, he's now going to stay and I think it might be other players who move on in the front line rather than Diaz.""

A move to Real Betis - where he spent last season on loan - is looking unrealistic at this stage of the window and the winger wants to take his time to choose his next move.
A number of other clubs from across Europe, including Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich, have been monitoring his situation.
However, Bayern's priority is a left-winger rather than a right-winger, and Leverkusen boss Erik ten Hag - who signed him an £86m deal for United in 2022 - has been quoted in Germany saying ""we are not interested at the moment"".
Ten Hag also stated: ""we'll see what happens in the future,"" which may be an indication of the financial parameters set by United to buy him.
Antony thrived at Betis but they cannot afford a permanent deal as things stand and are hoping for the chance to discuss another loan.
The winger scored nine goals and made five more for team-mates in 26 appearances.
United prefer a permanent sale but bids are yet to materialise and only Leverkusen and Betis are thought to have contacted them so far.
The interest from Saudi Arabia is thought to be increasing and Antony maybe open to exploring the idea, although he would prefer to remain in Europe.

Man Utd won't sell players on the cheap - Amorim,"Ruben Amorim says rival clubs might be in for a ""shock"" if they think they can sign Manchester United's unwanted players on the cheap this summer.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd6g6dqld23o,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:33:33",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Ruben Amorim says rival clubs might be in for a ""shock"" if they think they can sign Manchester United's unwanted players on the cheap this summer.
Amorim exiled his so-called 'bomb squad' - Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrrell Malacia - at the start of pre-season.
While Rashford has now sealed a ""dream"" move to Barcelona, the other four remain at the club and have been told to train back at Carrington, having been left out of United's squad for the three-game Premier League Summer Series in the United States.
Real Betis remain keen to bring Antony back after the Brazilian's impressive spell on loan last season, while Juventus are interested in Sancho but need to offload players first, and Garnacho has been linked with numerous clubs.
But no deals are imminent and the feeling persists that suitors will wait to the latter days of the transfer window, which closes on 1 September, in the belief the price will drop.
Amorim warned that will not be the case, and if those players have to come back into the fold, they will.
""[Technical director] Jason [Wilcox], [chief executive] Omar Berrada and the club have a number for these players,"" said Amorim.
""If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.
""Some players have to find a new place so we have more space in the team and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams.
""We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide.
""I understand the clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I'm ready to receive the players.""
New signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon have arrived at United this summer, but the club still want a striker and a holding midfield player to address clear weaknesses in Amorim's squad.
While that might not happen, the former Sporting boss insists he would be happy if he has to face Arsenal in the opening game of the season with the current group of players he has at his disposal.
""At the moment, our club needs to be really careful when we sign a player,"" he added.
""So if we have to start the season with this squad, I'm happy because all the players that are here want to be here - and that for me is the most important thing.""
United have spent almost £130m on forwards Cunha and Mbeumo, believing the pair can supply the goals to fire them up the Premier League table from the dismal 15th place they ended last season.
For both players, the move represents a risk.
Cunha had interest from Tottenham and Arsenal but, having harboured an ambition to play for United as a boy, snubbed the chance of Champions League football to become part of the sizeable Old Trafford rebuild.
He knows the likely reaction to a below-par start to the season, and given United's opponents include Manchester City and Chelsea, in addition to Arsenal, in the first five games, the spotlight will be on immediately.
But Cunha doesn't care about that as the Brazilian, 26, said: ""I really think the pressure of this club is not really pressure, it's a privilege.
""This is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and when Ruben came to me and said he wanted me to help put the club in the perfect times again, it was a challenge I wanted.""

Man City to re-sign Trafford - why Guardiola wants keeper back,Manchester City are set to pay £27m to buy back goalkeeper James Trafford from Burnley.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgk3k0654x6o,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:21:53",Katie Stafford,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City are set to re-sign England Under-21 goalkeeper James Trafford for £27m, two years after he left to join Burnley.
The 22-year-old City academy graduate signed for the Clarets in a deal worth up to £19m in July 2023.
He impressed last season as Scott Parker's side won promotion back to the Premier League - keeping 29 clean sheets across 45 Championship games - and was named in the division's team of the year.
City had a buy-back clause for Trafford and also matching rights, allowing them to match any offer from another club.
They have done so following Newcastle's £27m bid - and Trafford has opted for a return to Manchester.
He is expected to sign a five-year contract with the option for another year at Etihad Stadium.
He will be the fourth goalkeeper at manager Pep Guardiola's disposal, with Ederson, Stefan Ortega and Marcus Bettinelli already at the club.
It is anticipated Trafford will challenge Brazil's Ederson, who has been first choice for eight years, for the number one spot.
Ederson is in the final year of his contract and has been linked with a move to Galatasaray, but last month described rumours of a departure ""99% fake news"".
City have not received any bids for the 31-year-old, but there are doubts about the future of German Ortega given the increased competition for game time once Trafford arrives.
Trafford signed for City's academy in 2015 but did not make a first-team appearance and spent time on loan at Accrington Stanley and Bolton Wanderers.
He has appeared for Burnley 73 times, including 28 in the Premier League in the 2023-24 season.
Trafford has represented England from Under-17 to Under-21 level, and was part of the winning European Championship squad of 2023, during which he kept six clean sheets and did not concede a goal.
He received his first senior international call-up in 2024 but has yet to make his debut at that level.
If he returns to the Etihad he will be City's sixth signing of the window after midfielders Tijjani Reijnders (initial fee of £46.5m), Rayan Cherki (initial fee of £30.5m) and Sverre Nypan (£12.5m); left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri (£31m) and Bettinelli (nominal fee).
They also spent £200m in the January transfer window to boost their squad following significant injuries.
'City can develop him into a top goalkeeper' - analysis
Manchester City insert buy-back clauses when they sell players yet tend not to activate them when those academy products move on.
But this is an example of why they put them in the deals, as it has proven helpful in the ability to buy back a talented player on this occasion.
Having served an impressive apprenticeship at Turf Moor, City believe they can develop him into a top goalkeeper - one who is already ready for the Premier League.
However the club now have the dilemma of moving on either Ederson, who is entering the final year of his contract, or Ortega, who has now slipped a place down the pecking order.
How does Trafford compare to City's goalkeepers?
Trafford conceded just 16 league goals with Burnley last term and kept a Championship-best 30 clean sheets, equalling Port Vale's Football League record which was set 71 years ago.
He also set a new Championship record of 12 consecutive shutouts between December and February before he was finally beaten in a 2-1 victory at Cardiff City at the start of March.
But despite his stellar performances in the second tier last season, the 22-year-old lacks a degree of top-flight experience and only 28 of his 153 senior appearances have been in the Premier League.
Trafford's shot-stopping is undoubtedly first rate and his save percentage stands at almost 85% last season.
That figure far exceeds the numbers posted by both Ederson and Stefan Ortega, although Trafford was largely facing inferior opposition at Championship level.
But he will have to develop his distribution if he is to fit into Guardiola's side and system as his pass completion of 70% is comfortably lower than that of Manchester City's current goalkeepers.
That is partly because Burnley opted to go long more often - averaging 55 long passes per game compared to City's 36 - and partly because Ederson and Ortega are more proficient at playing out from the back.

Hey big spenders - Liverpool lead top-four domination of £1bn deals,The biggest sides in the top flight are all at the top of the list for spending in the summer transfer window.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx232rg4xj9o,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 15:03:13",Michael Emons,['Liverpool'],"It has already been a transfer window like no other.
Premier League clubs have until 1 September to strengthen their squads and there have been huge deals every few days, with more still to come.
Arsenal are on the verge of completing the signing of Sporting striker Victor Gyokeres for £63.5m, while his Sweden team-mate Alexander Isak revealed on Thursday he is considering leaving Newcastle.
The 25-year-old forward could cost as much as £150m, with reigning champions Liverpool, who are the top spenders so far this summer, still maintaining an interest.
The Reds have already signed German international Florian Wirtz for a potential British record transfer of £116m and France forward Hugo Ekitike for an initial £69m fee, which could rise to £79m.
A Super League in the Premier League?
Data from Transfermarkt, external shows Premier League clubs have spent £1.63bn (1.87bn euros) on players since the transfer window first opened at the start of June.
Last season's top four make up five of the biggest spenders this season, with Manchester United - looking to make up ground after finishing 15th - the outlier.
Of the total figure, just over £1bn has come from six teams, the traditional so-called 'big six' in the Premier League era - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham.
Liverpool, who won the league by 10 points last season, are top of the list with £269m spent so far this summer. That includes the purchases of Wirtz and Ekitike, as well as Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez for £40.8m and right-back Jeremie Frimpong, who cost almost £35m from Bayer Leverkusen.
It has been a contrast to the 2024-25 campaign, when the Anfield outfit's only major signings were goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili and forward Federico Chiesa, who joined for a combined total of less than £40m.
Chelsea, fourth in the Premier League last season, have spent the second highest total this summer, with just over £212m. Their biggest moves have been a deal worth £60m for Brighton forward Joao Pedro, left-winger Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for £56m, and Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap for £30m.
Arsenal have been runners-up in each of the past three seasons and they would also pass the £200m mark with the arrival of Gyokeres, having already spent £137m. Their major purchases have included Spain midfielder Martin Zubimendi for £60m from Real Sociedad and Chelsea winger Noni Madueke for just under £50m.
Manchester City finished third last year and did their business early in the summer, with about £127m spent, largely on the trio of midfielder Tijjani Reijnders from AC Milan, left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves and French attacker Rayan Cherki from Lyon.
Manchester United suffered their worst campaign in the Premier League era when they came 15th. They are the only side outside last season's top four to have spent more than Manchester City this summer, but most of their £133.5m outlay has been on two forwards - Cameroon international Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Brazilian Matheus Cunha from Wolves.
Tottenham finished 17th in the table, but salvaged a disappointing season by winning the Europa League - beating Manchester United in the final - although it was not enough to avoid manager Ange Postecoglou getting the sack.
Spurs have since spent £122.5m under new boss Thomas Frank, with almost half of that in one transfer - the £55m purchase of midfielder Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, while it cost £30m to turn attacker Mathys Tel's loan from Bayern Munich into a permanent deal.
Where would Liverpool's spending rank for an individual window?
Liverpool are already sixth on the list of most money spent by one club in a transfer window around the world.
The top three in that statistic all came from last summer's window, where Chelsea spent £404.4m (463m euros), Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal spent £307.7m (353m euros) and Champions League winners Paris St-Germain paid out £305.1m (350m euros).
Real Madrid's transfer outlay in the 2019-20 summer window was £288.6m (331m euros), while Chelsea spent £287.7m (330m euros) in the winter transfer window of the 2022-23 campaign.
If Liverpool bought Isak for £135m or above then Arne Slot's side would move top of the list for most money spent in a single transfer window.
However, when taking 'football inflation' into account - the annual increases in Premier League revenue - their spending does not seem quite as lavish, with Chelsea topping the all-time list with their 2003-04 transfers.
""Liverpool's spending this season to date puts them just 48th in the all-time list,"" according to football finance expert Kieran Maguire. ""Even if they sign Isak for £140m it would only take them to about 12th.""
How could Liverpool afford to sign Isak?
It is a question fans were asking even before they signed the 23-year-old Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt.
""Liverpool have two potential restrictions in terms of transfer spending, cash and PSR (profit and sustainability rules). From a cash perspective the club are in a strong position,"" explained Maguire.
""The group accounts show that Liverpool generated more than £80m cash in each of the last two seasons, and new signings will be paid for on an instalment basis, so no problems here.
""Add in the extra money generated in 2024-25 from winning the Premier League (prize money and an expanded Anfield that generates more than £100m a season from ticket sales), a new kit deal with adidas that starts on 1 August, participation in the expanded Champions League and revenue is likely to exceed £700m.
""Some players have left, which has freed up money on the payroll too, as well as generating 'pure' profits if those players (Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jarell Quansah) are from the academy. There are other players that could be sold too to further assist the finances.
""PSR-wise Liverpool are very strong too. The allowable PSR loss is £105m over three seasons. Liverpool were well within that figure to the end of 2023-24 and the PSR add-backs, such as academy, infrastructure and the women's team costs, probably meant that Liverpool had a PSR profit going into the summer 2025 window.""
How does the spending compare to the rest of the league?
Each of the three newly promoted teams - Burnley, Leeds United and Sunderland - are in the top 10 of biggest spenders so far this summer.
Sunderland are seventh and have spent just over £100m on six new players, although they sold Jobe Bellingham and Tom Watson, recouping about £37m.
Burnley have added 10 players to their squad, at a total cost of just under £70m, while Leeds have spent just over £60m for their six new signings.
Fulham are the only Premier League side yet to spend anything this summer, while Crystal Palace's only paid purchase has been Ajax left-back Borna Sosa for £2m.
Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest both qualified for Europe, but are yet to make major signings. Villa's only addition has been teenage Turkish defender Yasin Ozcan in a deal worth £6.7m from Kasimpasa.
Forest have spent £27m on Brazilian duo Igor Jesus and Jair Cunha, but winger Anthony Elanga joined Newcastle for £55m.
What does this mean for the competitiveness of the league?
With less than a third of the league accounting for nearly two thirds of the total summer spending, what does this mean for the competitiveness of the division?
Only five months ago fans and pundits considered the Premier League to be as wide open as it had been in a long time, with Forest and Bournemouth both in the Champions League spots.
""I'm looking at Forest, Bournemouth, Fulham, Brentford, Brighton... they're not the biggest clubs in stature but what a job they've done,"" ex-Premier League striker Dion Dublin said on Final Score in February.
""They're all in the top 10 and I think it's just outstanding.""
However, normal service was resumed as Forest eventually slipped down to finish seventh, while Bournemouth were ninth.

Gyokeres to complete Arsenal move over weekend,Sweden striker Viktor Gyokeres is expected to complete a move to Arsenal from Sporting in the next 48 hours.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cnvmvp6e9gro,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 12:06:07",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Sweden striker Viktor Gyokeres is expected to complete a move to Arsenal from Sporting this weekend.
BBC Sport has previously reported a £63.5m deal was in the final stages, with the move only held up because of negotiations between the clubs over add-on payments.
The 27-year-old has been given permission to travel in order to complete his medical and is expected to sign a five-year contract and officially become an Arsenal player in the next couple of days.
The Arsenal squad is in Singapore on the first leg of their pre-season tour of Asia.
Speaking on Friday, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said he ""cannot talk about a player who is not ours yet"", but suggested any new signing would join the tour as soon as possible.
""For sure. Obviously once we have finalised everything with a player we want to integrate him with the team as quickly as possible,"" Arteta said.
""With Noni [Madueke] it was impossible because he needed some time [after playing in the Club World Cup]. I think he's going to take a shorter vacation than he deserves because he wants to join us straight away, as soon as we're back.
""I think immediately is better, so they can start to join the team, get to know each other and get the ideas we want to put in their minds.""
Gyokeres has been in demand during the summer transfer window after scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.
BBC Sport revealed earlier this month that Arsenal had turned their attention to him after hitting an impasse in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.
The search for a striker has been a drawn-out process for Arteta, who has been desperate to add an elite centre-forward after his side scored 17 fewer goals than Liverpool as they finished 10 points behind the Premier League champions.
The Spanish boss increased his overall attacking options with the signing of England winger Madueke, 23, from Chelsea last week.
Former Brighton and Coventry striker Gyokeres scored 97 goals in 102 matches during his two seasons in Portugal and helped Sporting lift back-to-back Primeira Liga titles.
During his time at Coventry, he was one of the most prolific strikers in the Championship.
He scored 43 goals in 116 appearances for the Sky Blues and was named in the Championship team of the year in 2022-23 as they reached the play-off final. That summer he signed for Sporting for about £20m.
He made his Sweden debut in 2019 against Finland and has 26 caps, scoring 15 goals.

England sweating on Lauren James’s fitness for Euro 2025 final against Spain,Wiegman says forward ‘still recovering’ from ankle injury,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/25/england-lauren-jamess-fitness-euro-2025-final-spain,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 16:00:12",Tom Garry,['Chelsea'],"England do not know whether ­Lauren James will be available for Sunday’s Euro 2025 final, Sarina ­Wiegman has said, with the Lionesses waiting nervously on the Chelsea ­forward’s fitness.
James, who was withdrawn at half-time in England’s semi-final win against Italy after sustaining an ankle injury, has started all five of the defending champions’ matches in Switzerland but is a doubt for their showdown with Spain.
“She’s still recovering,” Wiegman said on Friday. “She’s doing things on the [training] pitch and we have two more days so we’re going to give her time. We don’t know yet [if she’ll be ready], but that’s what we’re going to go for – [aiming for] 23 players available for the game on Sunday.”
The Arsenal forward Beth Mead, who replaced James on Tuesday, could be in line to start if James is unavailable and the super-sub Chloe Kelly could also be under consideration.
Ella Toone has predicted that another super-sub, Michelle Agyemang, will experience a significant change to her life when England return home after the striker’s starring role in the run to the final, but Toone has praised the 19-year-old’s maturity in her debut tournament.
When England won Euro 2022 on home soil Toone came on to score in knockout games against Spain and Germany. This summer, Agyemang has stepped up with late equalisers against Sweden and Italy to save England’s campaign.
“She might get papped eating a pasty like I did! I’ll have to warn her about that,” Toone said with a chuckle. “She’s definitely in the [team] bubble now, but I think when she gets out she’ll be recognised a lot more than she was before the tournament, that’s for sure, and she definitely deserves that as well.
“It’s mad, I would think she’s about 30 years old, she’s so mature. She’s so humble. She’s coming to this tournament with freedom, not a worry, not a care. She’s just gone out there and done what’s been asked of her.
“She’s been amazing for us. She’s turned up in big moments when we’ve needed her. She’s got a lot of talent and she can do a lot of things that not many players can do. Even when she scored and kept us in games, she’s been the same Michelle that she was when she started this tournament. I’m absolutely buzzing for her. It’s nice for good people to get things that they deserve and she’s definitely one of those people.”
England are contesting their third consecutive major final, which Toone described as “something the country can be proud of”. Toone thanked England’s fans for their support. “The fans at home, we’ve probably given them a heart attack,” she said, but she hopes the Lionesses’ fighting comebacks and spirit can help them in the final.

“You can see the fight from the team,” Toone said. “We’ll give 100% and we’ll fight like we always do. We’ll have that togetherness to hopefully get over the line.”
Wiegman is in her third straight Euros final and her fifth major final in a row, a sequence that began with winning the 2017 Euros with the Netherlands. Toone praised the Dutchwoman’s team talks, saying: “We had a good one before the Italy game, the night before in the meeting, one that definitely stood out. Then again before the game. Sarina’s speeches before the games have definitely got us motivated.
“Even though sometimes we have gone a goal down, you still remember the words that she said before the game and it makes you want to go out and put on a performance for the second half as well. She’s been pulling them out of the bag. No matter what Sarina says, you listen, because she’s reached five major tournament finals so she definitely knows what she’s doing.”
Toone also knows what to do in big games, having scored in an FA Cup final, a World Cup semi-final, the Women’s Finalissima at Wembley against Brazil and most famously when she opened the scoring in 2022’s Euros final against Germany with her lobbed effort. “Hopefully there’s a chance that I can put it in the back of the net like I have done in previous finals,” she said.

Marcus Rashford must stave off sense of anticlimax after Barcelona switch | Jonathan Wilson,"Blockbuster loan move brings real pressure for 27-year-old because, if this doesn’t work, what does his future hold?",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/25/marcus-rashford-barcelona-manchester-united-comment,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:25:16",Jonathan Wilson,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","If Anthony Martial hadn’t been injured in the warm-up, and Manchester United hadn’t already been missing 12 players, Marcus Rashford wouldn’t have played. It hadn’t seemed a particularly significant game: the second leg of a last-32 Europa League tie against Midtjylland on a chilly and cloudy February night. Old Trafford was far from full, the disillusionment that was beginning to stalk Louis van Gaal escalating after a 2-1 first-leg defeat.
It soon got worse for United as Pione Sisto increased Midtjylland’s advantage. An own goal pulled one back only for Juan Mata to miss a penalty before half-time. But Rashford then slammed in a Mata cutback and converted a Guillermo Varela cross with a side-foot volley to give United the lead. They ended up winning 5-1. In the space of 12 second-half minutes, Rashford had been elevated from almost complete unknown to potential messiah, a status he confirmed three days later by scoring two and setting up another in a win over Arsenal. He was 18, Manchester-born, confident but understated. It was almost too perfect.
What then would have seemed a plausible future? What would he have taken had fate offered? One hundred goals for United? Two hundred? A Champions League? Given that was before Gareth Southgate had become England manager, perhaps dreams of winning a major international tournament would have seemed far-fetched, but 20 goals for his country? Thirty?
Yet here we are nine years on, with Rashford unwanted at Old Trafford and joining Barcelona on loan. He has scored 87 league goals for United and picked up two FA Cups, two League Cups and a Europa League. And while he was part of the side that was second at Euro 2020, the achievement is inevitably tainted by the fact that he hit the post with his penalty in the shootout; three inches to the right, it would have been a goal and England would have led the shootout 3-2 with the pressure firmly on Italy.
It’s a perfectly decent career, but there is an unavoidable sense of anticlimax, particularly over the past couple of seasons. Having scored 30 goals in all competitions for United in 2022-23, when he also got three in the World Cup, Rashford has scored just 19 over the past two years, four of them on loan at Aston Villa. He has often looked disaffected, the headlines about his off-field activities switching from his campaign for free meals for children to ill-judged socialising.
Rashford is still only 27, at his notional peak – albeit that players who start early often reach their peaks early (and those who believe in the rule of 500 may note that Rashford reached his 500th career appearance in Villa’s 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest at the beginning of April).
He did enough for Villa to make it at least plausible that his problems are essentially those of Manchester United and that a reset may yet allow him to reach the heights that seemed conceivable a decade ago. There has been little evidence of the sort of physical decline, the loss of acceleration Raheem Sterling has apparently suffered. Yet Villa clearly didn’t see enough in his 10 league appearances for them to exercise their £40m option to buy; even given how close they are pushing the threshold for trouble with the profitability and sustainability rules, it’s hard to avoid at least a slight sense of Rashford failing upwards, rejection from Villa leading to an offer from Barcelona.
That’s assuming Barça are able to find another lever to pull so they can register him. He joins the goalkeeper Joan García in the queue of players Barcelona have signed but have not yet been able to register because of La Liga’s financial regulations. It’s not an uncommon problem at the club and they’ve always found a way. It took the controversial sale of rights to VIP seats for the next 25 years to a Qatari company for Dani Olmo and Pau Víctor to be registered last season. There is less and less future income to sell off. Rashford has agreed to a minimum 15% cut in his £325,000-a-week wages (potentially 25% including bonuses), but that still represents a significant sum even with Barça returning to the refurbished Camp Nou soon.
Complicated as Barcelona’s finances are, though, this could, if the issue is essentially clearing his head, be the perfect place for Rashford to recover his form. He’s away from the constant scrutiny of England, which was only heightened as he became a culture-war pawn. The pace and intensity of La Liga are not those of the Premier League. Barcelona play extremely attacking football, scoring 102 league goals last season; Rashford will get opportunities. Raphinha, who spent much of last season swooping in from the left, scored 18 goals.
Which does perhaps raise the issue of why Barcelona want Rashford. Theirs is not a squad short of attacking players: Olmo, Ferran Torres, Víctor, Pablo Torre, Fermín López, Gavi and Ansu Fati started league games on the left last season, sometimes with Raphinha operating centrally. Fati has been loaned to Monaco and Torre has been sold to Mallorca, yet Barça still targeted a left-sided player this season, and considered Nico Williams and Luis Díaz before settling on Rashford as a (relatively) cut-price option seemingly undeterred by potential registration problems.
Although there is a £26m option to buy, there is no obligation. If it works out, Barcelona get a quick and direct finisher and enhanced squad depth; if not, they can part ways at the end of the season, with nothing lost but a year of wages.
For Rashford, meanwhile, there is real pressure. If this doesn’t work, what is the future for him? Potential can be a terrible curse. It doesn’t matter how good a young Premier League player looks, he is only ever a couple of disappointing seasons from being linked with the Turkish Super Lig or West Ham. When you promise as much as Rashford did in those few days in February 2016, even a very good career can end up suffering the taint of disappointment, however unfair that may be. For Rashford’s career and his legacy, these next few months are vital.

"Newcastle’s Alexander Isak offered £600,000-a-week tax-free deal by Al-Hilal",Newcastle striker open to leaving St James’ Park,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/25/alexander-isak-offered-600000-a-week-tax-free-deal-by-al-hilal,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:51:57",David Hytner,['Liverpool'],"Alexander Isak has been offered a staggering £600,000-a-week tax-free deal by Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia with further lucrative bonuses on top. The Newcastle striker is open to leaving St James’ Park and Liverpool, who are long-term admirers, are keeping an eye on the situation.
Isak has not travelled to Asia with his Newcastle teammates for the club’s pre-season tour, officially because of a minor muscle injury, and is assessing his options. They include Al-Hilal, who reached the Club World Cup quarter-finals, losing to Fluminense, and want to make a grand statement by signing Isak – one of the most coveted players on the market.
Al-Hilal, who are managed by Simone Inzaghi, are prepared to sweeten the package for the striker with bonuses if he were to win the league and/or the Asian Champions League and top the scoring charts.
Isak has been unsettled by the transfer talk and he did not play for Newcastle in the friendly at Celtic last Saturday. The club have no desire to sell him and the fans would surely take the dimmest of views of their Saudi owners if they were to let him go to Al-Hilal. Like Newcastle, Al‑Hilal are owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.
Liverpool would not be able to match the personal terms that Al‑Hilal have proposed and it is unclear whether they would be able to afford the fee; Isak is valued at about £120m.
Liverpool have signed another striker – Hugo Ekitiké, for £79m from Eintracht Frankfurt – and spent heavily in other areas, most notably the £116m package for the midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen. Their other big deals have been for Milos Kerkez (£40m from Bournemouth), Jeremie Frimpong (£29.5m, Leverkusen) and Giorgi Mamardashvili (£25m, Valencia).
When sales are factored in, chiefly those of Jarell Quansah (£30m to Leverkusen), Caoimhín Kelleher (£12.5m to Brentford) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (£10m to Real Madrid), Liverpool’s net transfer spend stands at £235.5m. It is possible they could raise further funds by selling Darwin Núñez, Harvey Elliott and Luis Díaz, although they have maintained the Colombian is not for sale. Isak is contracted to Newcastle until 2028.

Transfer roundup: Trafford returns to Manchester City as Wrexham eye Eriksen deal,Goalkeeper back at the Etihad following Burnley spell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/25/james-trafford-returns-to-manchester-city-in-27m-deal-after-newcastle-snub,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 15:50:02",Will Unwin,['Manchester City'],"James Trafford will rejoin Manchester City from Burnley after the club matched a £27m offer from Newcastle for the goalkeeper, who will sign a five-year deal at the Etihad Stadium.
The 22-year-old started his career at City after joining the academy from Carlisle. He never made a first-team appearance for the club, spending time on loan at Accrington, Bolton and Burnley before moving to Turf Moor for £14m.
Trafford will join Ederson and Stefan Ortega at City in the battle to be first choice. Ederson has been a regular under Pep Guardiola but is a target for Galatasaray, while Ortega has been the subject of numerous inquiries this summer.
Newcastle had targeted Trafford for the past two seasons and thought they had convinced him to move to St James’ Park, only to be beaten to him by City, who included a matching rights clause when they sold Trafford to Burnley.
Trafford spent a season in the Premier League under the former City captain Vincent Kompany. Like most of the Burnley team, the goalkeeper struggled and was eventually dropped in favour of Arijanet Muric.
Last season, Trafford rebuilt his reputation in the Championship as part of a rigid Burnley defence, helping them finish second in the league to earn promotion. He has regularly been named in England squads but his yet to make his international debut.
Another team hoping for promotion from the Championship this season, Wrexham, have made an ambitious approach for Christian Eriksen, according to the former Manchester United midfielder’s agent. The 33-year-old Denmark international is without a club after his contract with United expired at the end of the 2024-25 season.
Manchester United head coach, Ruben Amorim, insists the club will not sell unwanted players cheaply and is prepared to welcome them back into the fold if necessary.
Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were left out of the tour of the United States – Marcus Rashford subsequently went on loan to Barcelona – and the so-called ""bomb squad"" have been training at the club's Carrington complex.
United's transfer dealings have been widely criticised in recent seasons and Amorim said chief executive, Omar Berrada, and sporting director, Jason Wilcox, would not be taken advantage of just to get rid of those surplus to requirements.
""Some players have to find a new place to have more space in the team and others clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams,"" Amorim told a press conference before a friendly against West Ham on Saturday.
""We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide. If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players.
""I know for a fact that these people, Omar and Jason, and the club have a number [price] for these players. If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that.
""I understand clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise and I'm ready. I'm ready to receive the players.
""They have more competition - if you want to play in the World Cup you need to play, so I'm really happy with that because I have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it is perfect.""
Eriksen’s agent, Martin Schoots, told the Daily Mail: “Wrexham are really upgrading everything both on and off the field, and it is a hugely impressive project, as you can see from the presence of people like [chief executive] Michael Williamson there. But Christian still wants to play in a first-tier competition and he absolutely wants to stay in Western Europe. There are some contacts going on but it has to suit both sides.”
Wrexham’s Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have shown plenty of ambition ahead of the Red Dragons’ return to the second tier of English football after a 43-year absence. They have already added the Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward, the left-back Liberato Cacace, the midfielders Lewis O’Brien and George Thomason and the forwards Josh Windass and Ryan Hardie to their ranks after a third consecutive promotion.
It has been reported that Wrexham, who begin their Championship campaign at Southampton on 9 August, have broken their transfer record twice this summer.

Los Angeles FC keen on move for Tottenham captain Son Heung-min,MLS club expected to make bid for Spurs forward,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/25/los-angeles-fc-keen-on-move-for-tottenham-captain-son-heung-min,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 10:34:46",David Hytner,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Son Heung-min is a target for Los Angeles FC and they have made their interest in him known to Tottenham. The London club have yet to receive any bids for Son but they can expect one from LAFC, which would leave their highest-profile player with a decision to make.
LAFC, who signed Hugo Lloris from Spurs in December 2023, have tracked Son for some time. It is understood there is no interest in him at present from clubs in Saudi Arabia, which has been mooted as a possible destination.
Son, who has one year on his Spurs contract, is poised to travel with the club on their pre-season trip to Hong Kong and his native South Korea. They depart on Sunday after the friendly at Luton on Saturday and Son’s legions of Korean fans are looking forward to seeing him in Seoul next Sunday when Spurs play Newcastle. It is unthinkable that the 33-year-old is not involved. Spurs face Arsenal in Hong Kong before that on Wednesday.
Son’s future at Spurs is in considerable doubt, with the new manager, Thomas Frank, offering no guarantees at his unveiling last Friday that the forward would stay beyond the closure of the transfer window. Frank also said he had yet to decide whether Son would retain the captaincy.
Son did wear the armband the following day when he played the second half of the 2-0 win at Reading; he was out of sorts and could get nothing going. Spurs appear well stocked in wide attacking areas, having signed Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and made Mathys Tel’s loan from Bayern Munich permanent. Frank can also call upon Brennan Johnson, Dejan Kulusevski, Wilson Odobert, Manor Solomon and Mikey Moore.
The club want to add the £60m-rated attacking midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest but talks are deadlocked. Forest are unhappy at what they consider to have been an illegal approach from Spurs.
Son is an authentic Spurs legend, having joined them from Bayer Leverkusen 10 years ago and scored 173 goals in 454 appearances. He helped them to win the Europa League last season, their first trophy since 2008.

Football transfer rumours: Sesko or Aghehowa to replace Isak at Newcastle?,Today’s rumours are Swedish dominoes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/25/football-transfer-rumours-sesko-aghehowa-isak-newcastle-liverpool,"Fri, 25 Jul 2025 08:25:22",David Tindall,"['Manchester United', 'Liverpool']","If anyone spots Eddie Howe appearing to be rehearsing lines on the steps of St James’ Park over the next few days, there’s an obvious explanation. It was from said vantage point 30 years ago that another Newcastle manager, Kevin Keegan, had to explain to angry and bewildered fans why they had sold Andy Cole to Manchester United. The modern-day version, of course, is Howe having to talk his way out of why the club could be letting Alexander Isak go to Liverpool.
To be honest, it doesn’t seem a very Howe thing to do, although rumours suggest the current Magpies manager wouldn’t be averse. And, if Howe knows his history, he might benefit, just as Liverpool once did, from the Coutinho effect – flogging a player at peak value and rebuilding key parts of the squad with the hefty proceeds.
Isak going to Liverpool (anything from £125m to £150m appear to be the latest quotes) would spark a different sort of effect, one involving dominoes. So if the Swedish striker topples towards Anfield, what other currently static deals might fall into place as the chain reaction spreads?
Let’s start with Newcastle. If Isak does move on, several sources are suggesting Leipzig’s 22-year-old forward Benjamin Sesko is top of Howe’s wishlist. He’d cost £70m and upwards. The Slovenian’s Leipzig teammate Loïs Openda has also been linked, while it seems pretty obvious that Brentford will want way more than the £25m that Newcastle are believed to have offered for their frontman Yoane Wissa. The Democratic Republic of the Congo international is 28 so another, more youthful, option for Howe could be the prolific Porto striker Samu Aghehowa (Howe and Aghehowa has nice symmetry; the equivalent of Pep Guardiola signing Josko Gvardiol, maybe). Aghehowa is just 21, although he has a reported release clause of €100m (£87m).
Liverpool’s financial house seems to be in excellent order so it appears there’s no desperate sell-to-buy necessity when it comes to Isak. That said, the astute bean counters at Anfield know that funds could be raised. A chunk could come from Harvey Elliott, who is reported to be on West Ham’s radar. He struggled to get minutes under Arne Slot last season, although Elliott has stressed he would love to develop his career at Liverpool. The last reported rumour of Darwin Núñez leaving was in mid-July after Napoli apparently said no, but the Luis Díaz speculation won’t go away and Bayern Munich’s £70m bid for the Colombian could get the green light if Isak is brought in.
Arsenal rumours, now, and maybe turn away if you’re a Newcastle fan already resigned to losing Isak. The Gunners want an elite left-sided attacker and Newcastle wideman Anthony Gordon is on a select list of three. Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze and Real Madrid’s Rodrygo (another supposed Liverpool target) are the others. Gordon would cost about £80m.
Aston Villa seem keen to rebuff Manchester United’s approach for striker Ollie Watkins but want to take Alejandro Garnacho away from Old Trafford. United want to sell but only at the right price. They also want rid of Antony, a flop at United but a hit at Real Betis. The Spaniards can’t afford turning their loan deal into a permanent one, so several teams in Europe are keeping a close eye on the Brazlian winger. The very latest? Two Saudi Arabian Pro League sides are ready to swoop.
Chelsea have dominated transfer land in recent times but there’s not too much happening down at the Bridge right now. João Pedro and Liam Delap have beefed up the attack and there’s no great desire to sell Nicolas Jackson: Manchester United are sniffing.
But the Blues, despite being stacked in that department, can’t help themselves when it comes to a creative No 10 type. The Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons is the main target, while they still have eyes for Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers.
