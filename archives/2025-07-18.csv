Man Utd make £70m bid for Mbeumo,Manchester United have submitted a third transfer bid for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo worth &#163;65m plus &#163;5m in add-ons.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13392554/bryan-mbeumo-transfer-news-man-utd-submit-third-offer-for-brentford-forward-after-first-two-offers-rejected,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 14:35:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have submitted a third transfer bid for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo worth £65m plus £5m in add-ons.
Brentford are considering the offer and are yet to make a decision.
Sky Sports News has been reporting that a new offer was expected after the previous, worth £55m plus £7.5m, was rejected several weeks ago.
Mbeumo has only wanted to join United for over a month, and the club are understood to have been encouraged by his determination to join them.
The Cameroon international returned to pre-season training with Brentford earlier this week along with another player whose future is uncertain; Yoane Wissa.
United have always been hopeful of doing a deal for Mbeumo in time to take him on their tour to the United States later this month.
He has been a primary target for them this summer after signing Matheus Cunha, while they are also still in the market for a centre-forward.
Should United complete a deal for Mbeumo, it could have ramifications in Newcastle's search for a striker.
The Magpies wanted to sign Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike, but the Frenchman now wants to join Liverpool, who are expected to make a bid for the 23-year-old.
Newcastle then showed an interest in Brentford striker Wissa knowing they could miss out on Ekitike.
Sky Sports News understands it is highly unlikely that Brentford will sell both Mbeumo and Wissa this summer.
It is seen by the club as too significant a loss of attacking talent and goals after already losing their head coach Thomas Frank and captain Christian Norgaard this summer.
It means whichever club agrees a deal for either of them first would almost certainly scupper a move for the other - with both players having a year left plus an option year on their contracts.
Newcastle have stepped up their interest in Wissa in the last 24 hours after seeing Liverpool move ahead in the race Ekitike.
And it may be that this change in dynamic has led to the timing of United's newest bid.
Like Matheus Cunha, who completed a £62.5m to Old Trafford from Wolves this summer, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.
Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.
While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.
At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.
His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.

How could Mbeumo fit into Amorim's new-look Man Utd attack?,Manchester United's road back has begun.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13378633/man-utd-transfers-how-could-bryan-mbeumo-matheus-cunha-and-bruno-fernandes-fit-into-ruben-amorims-system-next-season,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 14:45:00",Sam Blitz,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United's road back has begun.
For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.
Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, as is Brentford considering the club's latest offer of £70m in total.
On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.
""Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,"" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.
Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.
Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.
They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.
This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.
As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.
Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?
Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.
Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.
Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.
The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.
The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.
But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.
At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.
While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.
So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.
Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.
Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.
While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.
At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.
His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.
So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.
In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.
United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.
In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.
That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.
Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a ""lack of urgency to defend or attack the box"" as a contributor to defeats.
But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.
And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.
Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.
Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.
Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.
Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.
Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.
Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.
But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.
United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson of Chelsea is another situation United are monitoring.
While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.

Ekitike wants to join Liverpool with Reds ready to make offer,Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike wants to join Liverpool.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13397994/hugo-ekitike-transfer-news-eintracht-frankfurt-forward-wants-to-join-liverpool-as-reds-prepare-official-offer,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 13:28:00",,['Liverpool'],"Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike wants to join Liverpool.
The 23-year-old striker has agreed to the move in principle, if a deal can be done between the clubs.
Liverpool have indicated to the Bundesliga side that they are ready to make an official offer. Talks are progressing and the deal is expected to move quickly.
Ekitike scored 22 goals in 48 games across all competitions last season for Frankfurt as he helped them qualify for the Champions League.
Sky Sports' Adam Bate:
When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.
""These were players with similar profiles from teams that were better than our team, but not at the distance Paris Saint-Germain were from us,"" Oscar Garcia, Reims' then head coach, told Sky Sports. ""We challenged him to reach the level of the other two strikers.""
On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.
He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. ""Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.""
It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League.
""He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,"" concedes Oscar. ""They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.""

In June, Sky Sports News reported City had agreed a £12.5m deal with Rosenborg BK for the 18-year-old midfielder.
It is Rosenborg's record sale.
Nypan has signed a five-year contract until 2030.
City consider him a star for the future and he is expected to go out on loan this summer.
If a loan is not arranged before City return for pre-season then Nypan will train with the first-team until a loan is arranged.
Nypan, a Norway U21 international, is considered one of the country's top prospects and has been labelled the 'next Martin Odegaard'.
City had already made four summer signings - Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli.
Sky Sports' Pat Rowe:

""Sky Sports News reported in January that Arsenal were in discussions to sign the player, but Nypan himself wanted to wait until this summer to make a decision.

Nypan to Man City and how clubs navigate post-Brexit market,Sverre Nypan is uncapped by Norway but is now a Manchester City player as clubs across England have learned to operate in the complicated post-Brexit transfer market.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyg5qv38y6o,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 07:17:05",Nick Mashiter,['Manchester City'],"On the face of it, Manchester City's £12.5m deal to sign Norwegian teenage prodigy Sverre Nypan is the Premier League side looking to the future.
But with the UK no longer part of the European Union, clubs now have to navigate a more complex transfer and work permit system to ensure players - especially those who are yet to establish themselves at the top level - are able to move to England.
Nypan is 18, has yet to earn full international honours for Norway, but he has signed a five-year contract at Etihad Stadium in what has been a record sale for Rosenborg.
Since Brexit, clubs have to consider regulations around Governing Body Endorsements (GBE) and, more recently, Elite Significant Contributions (ESC) - the criteria which has made it easier for English teams to sign players.
Manchester United's deal for left-back Diego Leon this summer and Tottenham's move two years ago for defender Luka Vuskovic are perfect examples, while Chelsea have also used the system well.
But how do clubs plot their way through the market now?
So what is a GBE?
GBE stands for Governing Body Endorsement which, since January 2021, has been required for any non-British player to play professionally in the UK.
There are two main ways to get a GBE - an autopass, or qualification through criteria compiled by the Football Association.
Some players gain an autopass through their international record, earned by the number of appearances for their national team over the past two years.
In most cases only competitive fixtures are included, with friendlies only considered in extreme cases such as a lack of competitive internationals in the timeframe.
If players have played more than 30% of games for a nation ranked 1-10 in the world they will be eligible for an autopass. If they represent a side ranked 31-50 - including Norway, Romania and Ivory Coast - they must have played over 70%.
Spain international Martin Zubimendi, who joined Arsenal for a deal worth almost £60m from Real Sociedad, has an autopass. But Brighton signing Charalampos Kostoulas, bought from Olympiakos for over £30m in June, had to qualify for a GBE with 17 points.
A minimum of 15 points is required, earned through a variety of criteria - league quality, domestic minutes played, league position, continental progress and minutes played in continental competitions, including the Champions League or the Copa Libertadores in South America.
The Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 are all considered Band One and earn players 12 points.
Band Two includes the English Championship (when signing non-British players who do not automatically qualify), Portugal's Primeira Liga, the Eredivisie in the Netherlands, Belgian First Division A, the Turkish Super Lig, while Band Three includes Major League Soccer in the United States. The Greek Super League is considered Band Four, while Band Five includes Poland's Ekstraklasa.
Kostoulas has yet to feature for Greece, but playing in the Super Lig earned him six points, his domestic minutes percentage counted for three, Olympiakos winning the title earned him three and reaching the Europa League quarter-finals earned four, with his minutes played on that run earning another one point.
But what is an ESC?
The ESC rules allow a team in England [only England in the UK] to hold the registration of a player who does not qualify for a full GBE - one who cannot reach 15 points or get an autopass.
Clubs in the Premier League and Championship have up to four ESC spots each, but they are not entitled to all four automatically.
The main consideration for the number of slots is the percentage of minutes clubs give to their English players.
The magic number is 35%. Dropping below that begins to reduce the number of ESC slots available to Premier League and Championship clubs.
League One and Two clubs have a maximum of two ESC spots, although sides at that level are unlikely to be in the international market as much.
Once a slot is used on a signing, such as Nypan, it is gone until such time as the individual is sold or converted into a full GBE player.
Conversion can happen after 12 months if a player in an ESC slot then meets the GBE criteria or plays a certain percentage of available minutes for the team. Their ESC slot is then returned.
It could happen if the player plays in 25% or more of matches which qualify for the club.
There are criteria to bring in a player on an ESC - it is not a complete wildcard.
A player can hit any of eight clauses presented by the FA in their GBE regulations. These include: playing in at least one competitive youth or senior international match for a top-50 ranked nation, or five times if the country is outside the top 50.
Players could also have played in at least five domestic youth or senior competition matches, but they must be in a Band 1-5 league.
For example, Cherif Yaya, who joined Nottingham Forest in July from Portuguese club Rio Ave - both clubs owned by Evangelos Marinakis - moved to England on an ESC.
Who is using the system well?
Manchester City made their first move using an ESC to secure Nypan. The teenager did not qualify for a GBE as he only has seven points.
The avenue of clubs bringing in 16-year-olds, like Arsenal did with Cesc Fabregas in 2003, are over because of Fifa regulations stopping them from signing players under 18 directly.
Until Brexit, this rule was superseded by the EU's freedom of movement, therefore the movement of 16 and 17-year-olds is still frequent within the EU and one of the main reasons more Irish players can now be found in European clubs.
However, there are other ways. Tottenham signed Vuskovic under ESC rules when he was 16 in 2023. The centre-back stayed with Hajduk Split before being loaned to Radomiak Radom in Poland and Belgium side Westerlo.
He played 36 times last season, scoring seven goals, as Westerlo finished seventh in Belgium's top flight. Spurs' work paid off with Vuskovic now classed as a GBE and he made his Croatia debut against Czech Republic last month.
Chelsea have also utilised the system to their advantage. Andrey Santos signed in January 2023 from Vasco de Gama, remaining with the Brazilian side on loan after  initially missing out on a work permit.
He was issued one that summer and sent on loan to Nottingham Forest for 2023-24, but he managed just two appearances before instead joining Strasbourg, Chelsea's French sister club, on an 18-month loan.
Kendry Paez, Mike Penders, Dario Essugo and Estevao Willian have also all moved to Stamford Bridge this summer on GBE deals, after initially staying with their parent clubs.
Newcastle have been active in the ESC market by signing 18-year-old winger Antonio Cordero from Malaga.
""The trend is to get young players and put them on a long contract and it gives you a lot of flexibility,"" said Andy Watson, owner of website GBE Expert Hub, who guides clubs on the intricacies of the system.
""Then hopefully they establish themselves. Santos at Chelsea is a great example. They will probably keep him but could have sold him for tens of millions.
""It's become a business in terms of player trading. You need to have careful planning. You can't just sign anybody.
""With the ESC slots there has been more freedom, but there still needs to be a plan of how to get the players out of those slots. You can only use four.
""ESC is being used to sign players who are very young and a bit more of a risk and it wouldn't surprise you if the ones who have used ESC more than others are Bournemouth, Aston VIlla, Wolves.
""About 75-80% of the ESC transfers [in 2024-25] have been for 18-year-olds.""
What about the lower leagues?
There has been a rapid rise in international recruitment in the Championship, owing much to the introduction of the ESC.
Last season, according to GBE Expert Hub, there were approximately 59 ESC transfers, up from approximately 23 in 23-24 season, while there were 107 GBE-related deals, rising from 19 in 2021-22 when the regulations were first introduced.
Wilson Isidor scored 12 goals for Sunderland after initially joining on loan from Zenit St Petersburg, helping the Black Cats return to the Premier League after an eight-year absence.
His ESC move became a GBE one once the Black Cats made the deal permanent in February.
Defender Torbjorn Heggem missed just one league game for West Brom after joining from Sweden's IF Brommapojkarna, while Derby goalkeeper Jacob Widell Zetterstrom played 41 games having signed from Djurgaarden in Sweden.
""There's been almost an explosion of overseas recruitment in the last 12 months which I don't think people foresaw - a lot of people felt Brexit would restrict foreign trade and it hasn't,"" said Watson.
""It tells you recruitment teams are using the data more in the non-domestic market.
""There aren't as many bad decisions being made at Championship level [compared to the past] and not as many clubs getting into trouble. ESC and Brexit form part of it.
""The regulations of GBE almost ringfence the pool of players you can go for, so you are not taking as many risks or making as many bad decisions. That is one of the good things from the regulations.""
With the 15 points needed for a GBE, it is unlikely players available to League One and League Two clubs would qualify, so the ESC opens up more options.
Reading profited from the rule by signing New Zealand centre-back Tyler Bindon from LAFC academy in 2023, before selling him to Nottingham Forest in February. He is due to play on loan for Sheffield United this season.
Notts Country signed American goalkeeper Tyler Miller on an ESC in April after striker Alassana Jatta played enough minutes to qualify as a GBE and free up an extra spot. Miller was released at the end of the season.
Bolton's Szabolcs Schon played 44 times last season after joining on an ESC from Hungarian side Fehervar, while Peterborough signed defender Oscar Wallin and forward Gustav Lindgren from Degerfors last season.

Liverpool close in on Ekitike in £70m-plus deal,Liverpool are in advanced talks to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike in a deal worth more than £70m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1lj15rg412o,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 10:50:06",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool are in advanced talks to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike in a deal worth more than £70m.
Multiple sources have indicated that Liverpool aim to have the transfer wrapped up by this weekend.
Newcastle have had a £70m offer for Ekitike rejected by Frankfurt, with Liverpool's offer expected to surpass it.
Ekitike is open to joining the Premier League champions, who want to sign a central striker.
The 23-year-old scored 15 goals in 31 starts as Frankfurt finished third in the Bundesliga last term.
However, Ekitike is a provider as well as a scorer, with his eight assists ranking him within the top 6% among forwards for creating chances in Germany last season.
Ekitike registered 117 shots on goal in the Bundesliga last term - more than any other player.
His expected goals figure of 21.6 was the league's second highest.
Liverpool have also shown a major interest in Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, but the Magpies are adamant the Swede is not for sale at any price.
Liverpool have signed midfielder Florian Wirtz in a potential British record £116m deal this summer and paid £40m and £30m respectively for full-backs Milos Kerkez wand Jeremie Frimpong.
Newcastle are expected to accelerate their interest in Brentford striker Yoane Wissa within the next 24 hours after their own attempts to land Ekitike slowed.
'Ekitike is a versatile attacker'
Hugo Ekitike is the latest success story of Eintracht Frankfurt's recruitment.
The Frenchman was not unknown when he first joined Frankfurt on loan in early 2024 but had fallen in a bit of a hole. The striker had attracted the interest of other clubs, including Newcastle United, when he was coming through at Reims.
He opted for joining Paris St-Germain but he couldn't quite break through amid the club's embarrassment of riches in the attacking department.
Frankfurt picked him up and signed him on a permanent deal a year ago. He served as both a lone striker and in a partnership under Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller.
During the first half of last season, Ekitike and Omar Marmoush formed a fearsome  pairing but this was broken up when Manchester City signed Marmoush for £63m in January.
Subsequently, Frankfurt did not acquire a replacement for Marmoush and instead changed the tactical set-up. During the second half of their 2024-25 campaign, Ekitike played up front, with two attacking midfielders behind him.
As for Ekitike's playing style, he is versatile and is not  a striker who only feels at home inside the box. When he played alongside Marmoush, both swapped positions constantly. Ekitike might not be the most dynamic player, but he can get by defenders with smart moves.

Man Utd make third bid for Brentford's Mbeumo,Manchester United make an offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo that could be worth up to £70m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg4rdlz6wxxo,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 14:07:16",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have made a third bid for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo that could be worth up to £70m.
The offer is understood to be an initial £65m, with £5m in add-ons.
Brentford are yet to respond to the offer.
United have remained confident about getting Mbeumo and had been hopeful of adding the Cameroon international to Ruben Amorim's squad before they head to the US on Tuesday for three pre-season games.
Although United have been strongly linked with Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez in recent days, it has always been the priority at Old Trafford to get the Mbeumo deal done in time for Amorim to work with him in the Chicago, where United will largely be based for their 13-day trip.
The 25-year-old scored 20 Premier League goals last season and a number of clubs were interested in him, including Tottenham, now managed by former Brentford boss Thomas Frank.
However, Mbeumo's preference was to join United.
Brentford's other main goal threat, striker Yoane Wissa, is the subject of interest from Newcastle.
Last season Amorim repeatedly spoke about United's failure to convert their chances.
Their 44 Premier League goals was their worst return in a domestic campaign since they were relegated in 1973-74.
United have signed forward Matheus Cunha and defender Diego Leon in the summer transfer window.
If the transfer goes through, it is likely to mean skipper Bruno Fernandes playing in a deeper role as Cunha is earmarked for one of the two inside forward slots behind a main striker that Amorim prefers.
It will also mean there is even less chance of the four forward players presently in first-team exile - Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony - being brought back into the fold.
United open their league season against Arsenal at Old Trafford on 17 August.

'One of the best upcoming midfielders' - Man City complete Nypan deal,Manchester City sign high-rated teenage midfielder Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg for £12.5m on a five-year deal - and City fans have every reason to be excited.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c629p62l535o,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 17:10:02",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City have completed the signing of 18-year-old midfielder Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg for £12.5m on a five-year deal - and fans have every reason to be excited about the potential latest addition.
Teenager Nypan has represented his country at youth levels up to and including under-21s, and it is expected he will go on a season-long loan for the 2025-26 campaign.
It is understood that, if a loan is not arranged before the players return for pre-season on 28 July, he will train with Pep Guardiola's first team.
""It's a dream for any young footballer to become part of this club and to join such a group of world class talent,"" said Nypan.
""I am still very young with a lot to learn but the chance to be coached by Pep Guardiola, the best manager in the world, will only help me to become a better player.""
The acquisition of the highly rated Nypan is a sign of City looking to the future.
""Sverre Nypan has been regarded as one of the best talents in Norway and been playing at a very high level despite being so young,"" said Norwegian journalist Andreas Korssund., external
""He's been looked at as the next big thing from the Norwegian league, so it's not a surprise he's securing such a big move. The surprise maybe is he's coming to City at such a young age.
""If you look at the other Norwegian top talents such as Erling Haaland [who went to Red Bull Salzburg and later Borussia Dortmund] and Antonio Nusa [who went to Club Brugge and then RB Leipzig], they went down the other route, going to a club for guaranteed football before looking elsewhere to the Premier League or La Liga.""
Comparisons with Arsenal's Odegaard
Followers of Norwegian football have witnessed a rapid rise for Nypan, who made his first-team debut at Rosenborg aged 15.
He has made a big impression in Norway over the past two seasons, winning the top-tier Eliteserien Young Player of the Year award in both 2023 and 2024.
He has largely been used as a central midfielder but can operate as an attacking midfield, winger or in a centre-forward role, too, and is comfortable using either foot, is quick, a good dribbler and able to take on and beat a defender.
In 70 appearances for Rosenborg, he has scored 14 goals and contributed 11 assists.
With him playing in the same position and being from the same country, there have been inevitable comparisons with Arsenal and Norway midfielder Martin Odegaard, who also made his debut in the Norwegian top flight aged 15.
""Both are technically skilled and have good passing abilities,"" said Korssund. ""Odegaard might be more of a dribbler, while Nypan is more someone who controls the game from midfield.
""He is a bit more box-to-box than Odegaard. In my opinion he's definitely going to become one of Europe's absolutely best midfielders.""
'A massive future ahead of him'
Nypan played 28 of 30 league matches last year, scoring eight goals to become the club's joint second highest scorer of the campaign, with his first senior hat-trick coming last August during Rosenborg's 4-0 home victory over Lillestrom.
Those goals helped Rosenborg finish fourth and secure a place in Conference League qualifying, after they had missed out on European football last year when finishing eighth in 2023.
Nypan made his debut in a 4-2 away win over Jerv on 6 November 2022, six weeks before his 16th birthday in one of two appearances in that season.
The following year was his breakthrough campaign.
In 2023, he made 17 league starts, plus six substitute appearances, and also featured in three matches in Conference League qualifying.
He played in the 3-2 win over Northern Irish side Crusaders and then impressed during both legs of the third qualifying round tie with Hearts.
Nypan, then only 16, set up a goal in Rosenborg's 2-1 first-leg win, but the Norwegians lost 3-1 at Tynecastle as the Scottish side scraped through 4-3 on aggregate thanks to a last-minute winner from Cameron Devlin.
After that first leg, then Hearts head coach Frankie McAvoy felt Nypan had everything needed to reach the top, saying: ""We knew he was a special player and he showed that.
""He also appears to have a good head on his shoulders and when you can do what he does in the final third by creating scoring chances then you have a big opportunity to be successful.
""He has a massive future ahead of him.""
Man City win race for in-demand teenager
It was not long after his emergence before Nypan was catching the eye of Europe's big clubs.
Norway's TV2 reported in August 2023 that scouts from Manchester United had watched Nypan, but Rosenborg boss Alfred Johansson praised the youngster's attitude, stating: ""He focuses on enjoying football and training every day.
""It's very impressive, and that's how it should be, but not everyone would have been able to do it. That is strong of Sverre.""
Arsenal were interested in the teenager in January 2025 and again this summer, with Aston Villa another one of the sides heavily linked with him, before Guardiola's City had a bid accepted.
The deal is a record sale for Rosenborg, beating the £8.5m they received when striker John Carew went to Valencia in 2001.
Nypan becomes the third Norwegian player at Etihad Stadium, joining up with star striker Erling Haaland, 24, and attacking midfielder Oscar Bobb, 21.
Korssund felt it would take Nypan a while to settle in at City, but he predicted he could get to the very top.
""It's a big step for him to go to the Premier League, so he'll need time to adjust before becoming a starter,"" said Korssund. ""But I have no doubt City have secured one of the best upcoming midfielders in the world.
""He's that kind of player we feel is going places. How people talk about him is similar to how Nusa, Odegaard and Haaland have been spoken about, both in the media and by the fans.""

Elanga eager to ‘showcase talent’ at Newcastle but stays noncommittal on Isak’s future,Swede ‘staying super-focused’ amid Liverpool interest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/17/elanga-eager-to-showcase-talent-at-newcastle-but-stays-noncommital-on-isaks-future,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:00:30",Louise Taylor,['Liverpool'],"Newcastle’s new £55m signing Anthony Elanga has insisted that Alexander Isak is “super-focused” in training but the winger sidestepped a series of invitations to predict precisely how much longer his Sweden teammate intends to remain part of Eddie Howe’s squad.
Elanga’s arrival on Tyneside last week coincided with intense speculation that Liverpool were readying a £130m bid for Isak. Although Newcastle have repeatedly reiterated that they are determined to keep their prized centre-forward, and the Anfield board are in advanced negotiations to sign the Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike, Isak’s thoughts on the future remain unknown.
“There’s always going to be noise around a player of Alex’s stature,” said Elanga as, relaxing after a ­morning training session at Newcastle’s camp in Austria, he spoke publicly for the first time since joining from ­Nottingham Forest. “But he’s always staying super-focused. He’s one of the best attackers in the world but he’s a Newcastle United player right now.”
When, earlier this week, Newcastle made a bid for Ekitike speculation intensified that Isak could be heading for the St James’ Park exit, but the club maintained Howe’s plan was to play the Swede alongside the France Under-21 international. Now the club are exploring, among other options, a potential attempt to recruit Brentford’s Yoane Wissa to alternate between partnering and understudying Isak.
Yet with Tottenham also keen on Wissa and some members of Newcastle’s hierarchy concerned that, at 28, the Democratic Republic of the Congo striker would have limited resale value, any transfer is some way from completion.
Isak is contracted to Newcastle until 2028 and has, so far, indicated no great enthusiasm for an extended deal, which makes it seem likely he will seek a move next summer at the latest.
“Whenever I speak to Alex it’s always about good things,” said Elanga, diplomatically. “About how my family is and how his family is. I always try and focus on the present. But that mentality Alex has shown in training is second to none and I’m looking forward to continuing to train with him.
“For me, he’s the best striker in the world and an amazing person as well that I can always rely on to go for advice. He’s always there to help me. I appreciate him a lot.
“Alex being here is amazing, so, of course, he played a part in me joining Newcastle but so did having Sandro [Tonali], Bruno [Guimarães], Joelinton and Anthony Gordon. They all played a huge part in me coming here. They have that winning mentality.”
Elanga believes “anything is possible” as the Carabao Cup holders prepare for a Champions League campaign. “I want to showcase my talent,” the 23-year-old said. “I’m pacey and direct. I can play on either side, I can play as a striker. I can use both feet. I’ve got lots of weapons.
“I know the gaffer and staff here can take my game to another level. What we want to achieve, how we want to play, it’s perfect. What we’re building here is unique and special. As soon as I knew about Newcastle’s interest it was a no brainer.”
Howe has long been impressed by a player who worked on his left foot during lockdown to become two-footed. “I’ve got a saying where I’m precise, not rushed,” said the former Manchester United winger. “It’s a French saying, precis pas précipité, something I go by a lot. In my life, I’ve never rushed anything. The staff and players here, they all share similar mentalities.”
Elanga believes this collective mindset will result in silverware next spring. “With the players and staff here and the addition of Martin Mark from Midtjylland as set-piece coach, we’re really on the right track. I can really sense that feeling of we really want to grab something and win something. Anything’s possible.”

Manchester United make improved Bryan Mbeumo bid with £70m package,Offer to Brentford for forward includes guaranteed £65m,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/17/manchester-united-bryan-mbeumo-improved-bid-70m-brentford,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 17:22:50",Will Unwin,"['Manchester United', 'Manchester City']","Manchester United have made an improved bid for the Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. The offer is worth up to £70m, with £65m guaranteed and the rest add-ons.
Ruben Amorim is eager to sign Mbeumo, who has indicated to Brentford he would like to join United, but Sir Jim Ratcliffe is eager not to pay over the odds. The London club have turned down at least one bid for Mbeumo from United and have demanded about £70m for a player who scored 20 Premier League goals last season.
United hope to make Mbeumo their third signing of the summer, after the Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha and the Paraguayan full-back Diego León. They fly to the United States for a tour next week and Amorim wants Mbeumo as part of the squad that travels, to give the Cameroon international as much time as possible to integrate.
United also hold an interest in Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson as they seek a central forward. Five players who will not be part of the tour are Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia, who want to leave and are not part of team training. United intend to sell them to raise funds for their summer transfer business.
Manchester City have completed the signing of the 18-year-old midfielder Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg. The Norway Under-21 international, who is understood to have cost €14.6m (£12.6m), became Rosenborg’s youngest player at 15 years and 322 days when starting against Jerv on 6 November 2022.
Nypan is City’s fifth summer signing, after Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Aït-Nouri, Rayan Cherki and Marcus Bettinelli. “There is already a special connection between Norway and Manchester City through Erling Haaland and Oscar Bobb,” Nypan said, “and I am very proud to have become the latest Norwegian player to have joined the club.”

Anfield officials have been given permission to discuss personal terms with the 23-year-old before finalising the fee and the structure of payments with his club. It is believed Ekitike and his representatives have agreed a six-year contract in principle.
Newcastle and Liverpool have held talks with Frankfurt this week over the France Under-21s international, with the former having a £70m offer rejected and attempting to reach an agreement during further negotiations on Wednesday.
Liverpool’s discussions with the German club have also intensified over the past 48 hours and the Anfield club have informed Eintracht that they will bid for Ekitike. Ekitike has a €100m (£86.5m) release clause but whether Liverpool’s opening offer will go that high remains to be seen. Talks between the clubs will continue on Thursday, with Ekitike having made it clear his preferred destination is Liverpool.
The former Reims and Paris Saint-Germain forward scored 22 goals and made 12 assists in all competitions last season, his first in the Bundesliga, as Eintracht qualified for the Champions League.
Alexander Isak had topped Liverpool’s list of targets for a No 9 and the champions were willing to pay a British record transfer fee to secure the Newcastle forward, but their understanding is the Sweden international is not for sale.

The 20-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the European champions and, although the fee is officially undisclosed, ­multiple sources say it is the game’s first to reach the £1m mark, as revealed by the Guardian a week ago, in a historic moment for the sport. The previous highest was the $1.1m (£890,000) paid by Chelsea for the US centre-back Naomi Girma in January.
Liverpool are understood to have accepted the seven-figure offer after rejecting several bids and the club intend to reinvest the money in the squad, having made about £800,000 in profit since signing Smith for a club-record fee of just over £200,000 from the Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon in July 2024.
Smith, who in 2019 became Canada’s youngest senior international at the age of 15, scored nine goals in 25 appearances for Liverpool.
“It’s a privilege and an honour to sign for Arsenal,” she told the club’s website. “It’s my dream to compete for the biggest titles here in England and in Europe and I’m excited to get started and contribute to doing that with Arsenal. The atmosphere the supporters create at Emirates Stadium is incredible and I can’t wait to have that behind me.”
Arsenal’s director of women’s football, Clare Wheatley, said: “We’re thrilled to bring Olivia to Arsenal. She’s one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here.”
Arsenal, who beat Barcelona in the Champions League final and are attempting to add strength for their attempt to defend that title, have also permanently signed the England winger Chloe Kelly, the ­former Liverpool vice-captain ­Taylor Hinds and the 24-year-old German goalkeeper Anneke Borbe, all on free transfers.
Arsenal are understood to have been impressed by the extensive experience Smith has accumulated at such a relatively young age and regard her signing as a major moment for the club.

Football Daily has long believed that no good can come from the prefix “multi”. Multi-storey car parks have been causing spikes in blood pressure ever since City & Suburban Electric Carriage Company opened the first anxiety maze at 6 Denman Street, London, in May 1901. Multiplexes are for watching films that have been dubbed over by some gobby ne’er-do-well crunching on a never-ending bucket of popcorn. Multiperspectivalism looks an interesting concept, sure, but we’re too thick to understand it properly and now we’ve got a headache. And the multiverse? This one not causing you enough misery?
Even this multipronged intro has outstayed its welcome. We could have just said that all connected with Crystal Palace are seeing the downside of football’s increasingly popular multi-club model. Last week, Palace were demoted from Bigger Vase to Tin Pot because Lyon – who are owned by Eagle Football Holdings, the company of Palace’s main shareholder John Textor, although he is in the process of selling his shares and we’re boring ourselves now – are in the same competition. Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, which means Palace are currently wearing a Tin Pot parachute against their will.
Their Bigger Vase place is likely to be taken by Nottingham Forest, whose benevolent concern for the greater good of football motivated them to inform Uefa of a potential breach of regulations by Palace. Forest’s owner Evangelos Marinakis also owns Olympiakos, but that’s different because … look, just click this for all the grown-up stuff. When Football Daily stumbled upon a video interview with Palace’s chairman Steve Parish and saw the quote “one of the great injustices”, our first thought was to wonder why Alan Bates had changed his appearance so drastically. Parish has appealed to Cas – and The Rest is Football, and anyone else who fancies an interview – so this is likely to go on for a while yet.
For a neutral teatime email there’s particular sadness in seeing Palace finish last in the Uefa Multi-Club Loophole Stakes. When they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May, one word was conspicuous by its absence from the immediate post-match analysis: Europe. All that mattered was that Palace had won their first major trophy at the tender age of 119, and gloriously to boot. A Bigger Vase spot was the reward, not the prize. We have sympathy, not least because a Uefa sermon on integrity is almost as hilarious as Bob Mortimer on Would I Lie To You? But this has been on the cards for one club or another since multi-club ownership became English football’s latest money-spinne – sorry, English football’s first opportunity to pioneer and deliver a consistent underlying approach to talent development, fan experiences, sports entertainment, commercial opportunities and community impact. Still, Palace v Forest on 24 August should be fun. No, you silly old romantic, not the football. We want cameras in the boardroom. These days, that’s where the real action is.

‘A massive contribution’: Wiegman heaps praise on England hero Hampton,Goalkeeper made two crucial saves in shootout,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/sarina-wiegman-reaction-hannah-hampton-england-euro-2025-sweden-shootout,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 00:11:54",Tom Garry,['Chelsea'],"Sarina Wiegman said England never doubted Hannah Hampton’s ability after the Lionesses goalkeeper made two crucial shootout saves to help send England through to the Euro 2025 semi-finals amid remarkable drama in Zurich.
The Chelsea keeper, who was named as England’s new No 1 by Wiegman in May when Mary Earps retired from international duty, also made two vital saves in normal time to help England battle back from 2-0 down to eliminate Sweden.
“She didn’t have [any] doubters in our bubble. I think she had a very impressive performance,” Wiegman told BBC Sport. “She had some very good saves in the second half. She had one penalty on the right side that was an incredible save. Pretty big contribution today.”
Wiegman later added in her press conference: “[She made a] massive contribution to a very good team performance. The outcome was really good and how the team stuck together, but she had a big contribution to that.”
The England head coach also praised Lucy Bronze, whose header helped spark the second-half fightback. Wiegman added: “Lucy Bronze is just one of a kind, I have never, ever seen this before in my life.
“I’m a very lucky person that I’ve worked with so many incredible people and incredible football players, and there are so, so many, but what she does and her mentality, and how she did that penalty and the goal, at the far post, she gets it in the net. But that’s not what defines her. What defines her is that resilience, that fight. I think the only way to get her off the pitch is in a wheelchair.”
Wiegman admitted she had thought England were going out of the competition “about three times” during this tense quarter-final, but was clearly immensely proud of their comeback, adding: “This team is just incredible. They stick together.”
Leah Williamson, the England captain, admitted it was “awful to watch” the penalty shootout but praised her teammates’ “incredible mentality” to fight back and reach another semi-final. The Lionesses saw four of their penalties saved but still progressed with a 3-2 win, largely thanks to heroics from Hampton, having earlier battled from 2-0 down in the regulation 90 minutes to send the game to extra time.
“We don’t ever give up and we’ve said it before, we’re never done, we never believe that we’re ever done and the fightback, the quality to turn the game around and then stay in it mentality, just incredible,” Williamson said.
“I just feel really, really proud. That was awful to watch at the end. [Penalties] are the easiest and the hardest thing in the world.”

Hampton produced two crucial saves in the shootout, first from Filippa Angeldal, who took Sweden’s first spot kick, and then from Sofia Jakobsson in sudden death, when Jakobsson had the chance to win the contest. Sweden also fired two penalties over the bar and Magdalena Eriksson struck the post as they missed five of their seven attempts overall.
Hampton, who was named as Uefa’s player of the match, said: “I think it shows that proper England is back. We’re getting in the right direction. Everyone would be putting their bodies on the line, literally, you can see that out there. Everyone is a bit battered and bruised.
“You know everyone has got your back out there and tackles were made when they needed to be. Players took it upon themselves to make sure that the team stayed solid throughout so if they had a bit of a niggle they decided to come off for someone else who they knew would be 100 per cent to go and make a difference because it was definitely a fine line between the result today.”
The Lionesses will face Italy in Geneva on Tuesday for a place in the final. The Italians are in their first semi-final since 1997, while the Lionesses are in their sixth consecutive major tournament semi.

Football transfer rumours: Nicolas Jackson to join Manchester United?,Today’s rumours wanna jive tonight,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/17/football-transfer-rumours-nicolas-jackson-to-join-manchester-united,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 08:45:14",Rob Smyth,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","The Villa Park Rehabilitation Centre for Disaffected Souls Who Learned the Hard Way that Old Trafford is No Longer the Theatre of Dreams or Let’s Be Honest Even Hopes could soon have a new arrival. After helping Marcus Rashford discovery his joie de football last season, Unai Emery reportedly wants to do to the same for Alejandro Garnacho, while also injecting him with an eye-watering level of tactical detail and a hitherto unseen desire to do the defensive hard yards.
Chelsea and Tottenham are also listening to Garnacho FM for the latest, which could result in an unlikely swap deal. The word on the street is the Manchester United’s search for a centre-forward has reached Nicolas Jackson, who might as well have a red shirt to go with the red cards he’s started collecting.
Villa and Milan also have a soft spot for Jackson’s unique brand of excellence, incompetence and occasional noggin-loss. But Villa might be advised to delete Chelsea’s number for the next few weeks: according to some of today’s rags, Chelsea’s main transfer target this summer is Villa’s potential superstar Morgan Rogers. Just as Pep Guardiola dreams of a team of midfielders, so Chelsea’s recruitment department are moving ever closer to an XI made up solely of attacking midfielders and wide forwards.
Milan and Man Utd are also engaged in an entirely metaphorical arm wrestle for the Brighton left-back Pervis Estupiñán, who fancies a new challenge and will sure as flip get one if he joins either of those two.
Detestors of all things Man Utd will be pleased to know we’re almost done with them for today. Before we go, Juventus are the latest club to consider a move for Marcus Rashford.
English football’s love/hate/actually-he’s-really-good-isn’t-he relationship with Granit Xhaka will resume if he becomes the most high-profile arrival of Sunderland’s £££tastic transfer window. Saudi Pro League club Neom FC are keen to scupper that particularly initiative.
Ademola Lookman, the man whose Europa League final hat-trick in 2024 denied Xhaka’s Leverkusen an InvinciTreble, is wanted by Inter. And Bayern Munich, who are back at the summit in Germany after the horrific one-year drought imposed upon them by Leverkusen, have highlighted VfB Stuttgart’s Nick Woltemade as Harry Kane’s eventual replacement.
Stuttgart have told Bayern where to stick their offer of €50m + €5m in add-ons, a 10% sell-on clause and a few laminated posters of Mario Gómez. But we know how this usually ends.
West Ham are doing things quietly, the Graham Potter way, but have already made one outstanding signing in the Senegal left-back El Hadji Malick Diouf. Next on their list is one or possibly both of Harvey Elliott, Liverpool’s curly-haired bundle of infectious creativity, and Bournemouth’s Marcus Tavernier.
