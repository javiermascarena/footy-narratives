On Tuesday, Sky Sports News reported the Reds are in talks with Crystal Palace over the signing of Marc Guehi and believe the defender wants to join them.
Liverpool get their league campaign under way on Friday when they face Bournemouth at Anfield, live on Sky Sports Premier League (kick-off 8pm).
Powered by the attacking attributes of summer signings Hugo Ekitike, Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong, Liverpool were impressive on the front foot at Wembley, slick in their combinations and eye-catching with their progress up the pitch against Crystal Palace.
But they were also vulnerable defensively, twice conceding equalisers to Palace to undo their good offensive play and then beaten in the penalty shoot-out.
Merson, who was at Wembley last weekend, was concerned by Liverpool's defensive performance in the Community Shield and believes they need defensive reinforcements to boost their title challenge.
Read on for the Magic Man's thoughts in full...
There's plenty for Arne Slot to ponder going into the new season.
Last season couldn't have gone any better for him, but it feels like there is so much more for him to work out now.
Last year, I thought the team virtually picked itself. However, this year there seems like a lot of competition for places, and it will be tricky to keep everyone happy.
Potentially throw in Alexander Isak and that problem gets bigger.
I worry for Liverpool this year, especially at the back.
I was at the Community Shield on Sunday and it was concerning how easily they were cut apart by Crystal Palace.
I'm not worried about them in attack. Going forward they will be sensational and more often than not, they will rip teams apart.
However, I can see them getting caught out at the back and particularly on the break. Teams will certainly have plans to hurt them.
There's been a lot of noise surrounding the potential deal to sign Isak, suggesting they will romp to the title if they sign the striker from Newcastle. I hear a lot of people saying that if Liverpool get Isak it's game over in the Premier League. It's finished.
I just don't see them winning the league as a foregone conclusion, Isak or not.
If I was Liverpool, I'd be looking more for a centre back than Isak. That has to be the priority for Slot, whose main centre-back options are Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez.
Compare that to the forward line and Slot has enough options going forward without needing Isak. Ekitike looked very good against Crystal Palace. Wirtz is also a top player. Everyone is going to enjoy watching him play this season. Throw in Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah and there are more than enough options there.
Why the desperation for Isak when it's obvious they so desperately need another defender? Adding Isak causes more problems, if anything, because all the forwards can't all play.
Slot will have to mix things up and change things constantly to keep everyone happy and that causes problems.
It's so important that Liverpool get a defender in before the transfer window closes.
They've also got the issue of Konate heading into the final year of his deal at Anfield. They won't want a Trent situation again with him next summer.
Then there's Van Dijk. Everybody looks good next to him because he's a Rolls Royce of a defender. He's that good.
But if he gets injured at all, I dread to think where they'd be. He's a great, great player and the lynchpin of the defence. Without him, it'd be a big problem.
Finally, it was a bit of a worrying performance from Salah at Wembley.
I don't think I've seen a player play that badly before in a football match.
But that can be Salah. He can go missing for a few weeks before going on a run of scoring in 10 matches on the trot or smashing in a hat-trick.
One thing that might be difficult for him this season is playing in front of Jeremie Frimpong.
Compared to Trent Alexander-Arnold, he's more like an attacking winger.
With Trent, Salah could make any run and he'd be picked out. Trent would also attract defenders, leaving Salah more space. Trent could destroy you himself.
Frimpong's a good player but he's not a destroyer. He plays so far forward that he's not a natural defender. Trent wasn't either but the same thing applies really, I think Ibrahima Konate could be too exposed.
There's a major problem down that side of the pitch, even more so than last season.

Liverpool in talks with Palace to sign Guehi,Liverpool are in talks with Crystal Palace over the signing of Marc Guehi and believe the player wants to join them.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13410625/marc-guehi-transfer-news-liverpool-still-keen-on-crystal-palace-defender-but-will-not-overpay-due-to-expiring-contract,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 17:13:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool are in talks with Crystal Palace over the signing of Marc Guehi and believe the player wants to join them.
Sky Sports News understands this has informed their decision to open talks with Palace for the England international.
The Eagles value the player at £40m but Liverpool will not overpay, given he has entered the final year of his contract at Selhurst Park.
Liverpool will only seek to agree personal terms with Guehi if a deal can be reached with Palace.
The club's leadership have a long-standing relationship with Palace chairman Steve Parish and want to conduct their business in the right way.
Parish has said he may have to consider selling Guehi if the defender does not sign a new deal.
The England defender is unlikely to sign a new contract at Palace. He was valued at £70m last summer when Palace turned down a series of bids from Newcastle.
Guehi also has the option of seeing out his contract and leaving on a lucrative free transfer next summer.
A number of big European clubs are believed to be interested in signing Guehi as a free agent at the end of the 2025/26 campaign.
Newcastle are not expected to be in the race for Guehi after agreeing a deal for centre-back Malick Thiaw with AC Milan.
Tottenham, who also had a bid for Guehi rejected in the winter window, are in the market for a defender this summer, but their priority at this stage is bringing in a winger and a No 10.
The Premier League champions are also interested in Parma's teenage centre-back Giovanni Leoni.
Parma could be open to selling the 18-year-old for around £26m (€30m) plus bonuses.
Interest in Leoni is not expected to affect Liverpool's potential pursuit of Guehi.
Liverpool need more experience at centre-back and Ibrahima Konate is entering the final year of his deal.
Sky Sports' Paul Merson on further transfer business for Liverpool: ""If I were Liverpool, I'd be looking more for a centre-back than signing Alexander Isak. Arne Slot has enough options going forward without needing Isak.""Hugo Ekitike looked very good against Crystal Palace. They desperately need another defender.""I hear a lot of people saying that if Liverpool get Isak, it's game over in the Premier League. It's finished. I don't see that at all.""It causes more problems, if anything. Where does Cody Gakpo play? There's Florian Wirtz, Mo Salah and then Ekitike.""If Isak arrives, they can't all play. Slot will have to mix things up and change things constantly to keep everyone happy and that causes problems.""

"Spurs Q&A: Savinho, Eze latest - and should expectations be lowered?",It has been a topsy-turvy week for Spurs in the transfer market.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13410523/tottenham-hotspur-transfer-news-qa-on-savinho-eberechi-eze-nico-paz-and-other-thomas-frank-targets,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 11:43:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"It has been a topsy-turvy week for Spurs in the transfer market.
The departure of Heung-Min Son and the pre-season injury to James Maddison have hampered the start to the Thomas Frank era in north London, with a 4-0 defeat at Bayern Munich last week showing how far Spurs are from the elite.
It has left Spurs scrambling around for transfer targets - particularly in the attacking area - with just under three weeks to go in the window.
What now for Frank's start to life at Spurs and how will Daniel Levy respond?
Sky Sports News' Michael Bridge answers the key questions involving Spurs - as they prepare to start their season with the UEFA Super Cup final against PSG on Wednesday...
The main players Spurs want are a No 10, a defender and a winger.
For the No 10, it's an absolute necessity that they bring someone creative in. News of James Maddison's ACL injury has really rocked Spurs. They tried to get Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White to be alongside Maddison - but have now ended up with neither player for the season.
On top of that, Dejan Kulusevski is out until probably mid to late October. You're losing a lot of goals and assists from even last season, which resulted in a 17th-place finish in the Premier League.
Eberechi Eze is a player who's been on their radar for some time. But before now, it's never gone beyond someone they've got an interest in.
Now the Crystal Palace midfielder can be considered among their top targets. They are also assessing other targets, including Como's Nico Paz - but that is looking like a difficult deal to do.
The long-term injury to Maddison means two attacking players are needed and Frank also said they would be in the market after Son's departure.
Spurs have approached Man City over Savinho. However, City do not want to sell him. He only signed for them last summer from sister club Troyes.
There are widespread reports a fee of around £43m (€50m) has been discussed in these talks. Sky Sports News understands the figure would need to be higher than that for City to consider selling him.
If Son is not replaced, you're then asking youngsters like Mathys Tel and Wilson Odobert to not only step up but to put some attacking figures down that they haven't produced yet in their careers. It's a lot for two youngsters.
You are then concerned about where the goals are coming from next season, especially with Dominic Solanke virtually missing the whole of pre-season with injury. Spurs will have to rely on Richarlison, who himself has had his fair share of injury problems.
There are no official names on Spurs' defender shortlist yet.
Spurs have Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero for centre halves who are probably their two best players to be honest. But they've both had some fairly bad injuries over the past couple of seasons, especially Van de Ven.
They have only Kevin Danso and Ben Davies in reserve, with Radu Dragusin out for another few months with an ACL injury and Luca Vuskovic expected to go out on loan.
Many thought Frank would have a difficult adjustment period, given how popular Ange Postecoglou was in north London.
But I have heard the all the players really like Spurs' new coach. When they beat Arsenal in Hong Kong - and yes it was a friendly - the Spurs group really liked the team talk he gave before the game.
Frank's style is a bit of a departure from that of Postecoglou - who would never really speak to the players at all on the touchline. Frank, meanwhile, will get his tactics board out on the pitch and explain things in detail to him.
But a lot of fans feel quite sorry for Frank in a way - because right now the club do not have enough depth and quality in the final third to really mount a challenge in all four competitions.
Even up front, you're relying on Solanke and Richarlison to lead the line in the Premier League and Champions League - when they've both had injury problems recently.
I don't think Spurs' squad is big enough at the moment. Of course, they had a memorable end to their campaign last season by winning the Europa League, but Daniel Levy has made it abundantly clear that they cannot sacrifice the league again.
Well, the current squad is not currently at Champions League level. In the most recent friendly against Bayern Munich, there were some concerning bits.
Again, it's only pre-season but it did look like men vs boys in certain periods - even in the second half when it was Bayern Munich's boys against Spurs' men.
Bayern were teaching Spurs a bit of a lesson and pre-season has given Spurs some warning signs.
For Spurs, a successful first season for Frank would be European qualification through the league, a decent cup run and make a good account of themselves in the Champions League.

Grealish signs for Everton on loan,Everton have completed the signing of Jack Grealish from Manchester City on a season-long loan.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13410126/jack-grealish-transfer-news-manchester-city-winger-joins-everton-on-season-long-loan,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:30:00",,['Manchester City'],"Everton have completed the signing of Jack Grealish from Manchester City on a season-long loan.
Speaking to evertontv after sealing his move to Merseyside, Grealish said: ""It's massive for me, honestly. This is a great club, with great fans.
""As soon as I spoke to the manager, I knew there was only one place that I wanted to go. On social media, I've been flooded with messages from Everton supporters, so there's that side of it as well and that's another reason why I chose Everton.
""I want to say thank you to the fans for all of the messages I've had already. Thank you for all of the love and support. I hope I can repay you now and I'm sure I will.""
The 29-year-old will wear the No 18 shirt for Everton - which has a special meaning for the England international.
""There is a reason for it,"" he explained. ""There were other numbers but my two favourite English players ever are Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne and I know they both wore number 18 here.
""So, as soon as I knew this deal was close, I had a look and number 18 was free, so that was perfect for me and it was the only number I was going to take from that point.
""I spoke to Wayne before I came here and I mentioned that to him - about the number 18 - so I hope he's happy as well!""
Grealish, who turns 30 next month, is a player much admired by Everton boss David Moyes. City recognised Grealish's need to play consistent Premier League football in a World Cup year, and that was partly behind their decision to leave him out of the Club World Cup squad.
They wanted to give him a full pre-season to find the best move for him.
Sky Sports News has reported this summer that the England international is desperate for more game time as he looks to force his way into Thomas Tuchel's thinking for next summer's World Cup.
Grealish has been working with a personal trainer in a bid to make sure he is in the best possible condition for the season to come.
Grealish had also been a target for Serie A champions Napoli earlier this summer, but will now remain in the Premier League and help Everton launch a new era at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.
City's £100m club-record signing has fallen out of favour under Pep Guardiola.
Grealish made just one Premier League start last season and was an unused substitute at Wembley for the FA Cup Final defeat to Crystal Palace.
The ex-Aston Villa attacker helped City win the Treble in 2023, playing a part in their Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup success.
Grealish could make his debut in Everton's Premier League opener at Leeds on August 18 in Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports.
Sky Sports' Paul Merson on Grealish's move to Everton boosting his World Cup chances with England:
""It's a brilliant move for both parties.
""For Grealish, he's been at Man City for a good few seasons now and it's a case of playing teams with everyone behind the ball. Teams have been doubling up on him and there's been no space. He now goes to Everton, and he'll have space. He'll be one vs one in a lot of games. He'll get the ball and be able to attack players, commit them and take them on.
""For Everton, they are getting an £100m player on loan. It's phenomenal for Everton.
""I just think this move ticks a lot of boxes. I think we are going to see the Grealish from his Aston Villa days.
""First things first, Grealish needs to focus on Everton and get going with his new club, but Grealish has given himself a chance with England with this move.
""England have so many players now. It's phenomenal, but a place in the England squad is in Grealish's hands. At City, it was out of his hands because he wasn't playing, but this move gives him a great chance to get back in and get to the World Cup.
""If he performs to the ability he can, Grealish will be on that plane to America to the World Cup.""

Merson says: Isak could have left Newcastle a hero but his legacy is now tainted,Paul Merson says Alexander Isak could have left Newcastle a hero this summer but his actions in trying to force a move to Liverpool have tainted a legacy that saw him play a key part in winning the Carabao Cup last season and ending the club's 70-year wait for a domestic trophy.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13410498/paul-merson-says-alexander-isak-could-have-left-newcastle-a-hero-but-his-legacy-is-now-tainted,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 11:55:00",Paul Merson,['Liverpool'],"Paul Merson says Alexander Isak could have left Newcastle a hero this summer but his actions in trying to force a move to Liverpool have tainted a legacy that saw him play a key part in winning the Carabao Cup last season and ending the club's 70-year wait for a domestic trophy.
Newcastle have endured a hugely-frustrating summer, missing out on a host of transfer targets while having to cope without Isak.
The striker is training away from the first team and will miss the weekend's Premier League opener at Aston Villa on Saturday lunchtime after telling the club he wants to explore his options elsewhere amid interest from Liverpool, who had a big-money bid rejected for the Sweden striker.
Reports now suggest Isak is adamant he will not play for Newcastle again and retains a desire to join Liverpool in a saga that has dominated, and will continue to dominate, the transfer window right up until the deadline on Monday September 1.
Read on for the Magic Man's exclusive thoughts on all things Isak, Newcastle and Liverpool...
It's an unbelievable situation Isak has put himself in.
He's taking a big gamble by reportedly saying he'll never play for Newcastle again.
Newcastle is a big city but it is a fish bowl in terms of football with it being a one-club city.
I wouldn't want to be in his shoes if he doesn't get his move. He's upset a lot of Newcastle fans with his actions.
If he now doesn't get away before the transfer window closes, he will need to score some serious goals to get the Newcastle fans anywhere near back on side.
If he leaves, he won't be leaving Newcastle as a hero.
Had he kept quiet, he still could have potentially gone for big money, giving Newcastle serious profit after giving his all to the club. He was a big part of that trophy success last season, and he would have been rightly remembered for it.
Everyone could have shaken hands and been happy with the deal eventually.
But that's now completely gone.
The situation is totally ridiculous. It just shows you the players have all the power.
Heads get turned in football.
There were so many saying Isak wouldn't leave, he wouldn't leave Newcastle.
In the end, when players decide they want to go, that's it.
It's just unbelievable.
Newcastle have just won their first trophy since before I was even born. Everything is great there and Isak is such a big part of that.
Suddenly, bang. An absolute spanner has been thrown into the works by Isak.
Newcastle rejected an opening offer of £110m plus add-ons but now, after what Isak has said and done, Liverpool are not going to offer any more. Why would they?
They know the situation and know Newcastle don't want an unhappy player.
The timing from Isak is interesting. Maybe he thought a deal over £110m would be enough. Newcastle held firm but now he obviously just wants to get away from St James' Park.
His hand has now been forced and that's why he is saying he won't play again for Newcastle.
He potentially thought the initial offer would get accepted and he wouldn't have to do anything. He thought he'd be leaving a hero but now that has gone.
It looks like Isak won't play against Aston Villa. He probably won't play against Liverpool and then Leeds, providing Newcastle hold firm and don't sell him.
If Newcastle lose two of those games, they are up against it already this season.
It's mind-blowing how this situation is allowed to happen.
Players sign big contracts and Isak is on a good few quid. He has three years left on his deal too so Newcastle should hold the cards really.
But someone comes in for him and he wants to leave, but now he won't play. I just don't get how it can happen.
This is a club that put him on the map.
He was obviously decent before he arrived at Newcastle but how many people knew about him? Now, he's a world-wide star and Newcastle helped him achieve that.
I don't like what is happening.
If Isak would have kept quiet, trained with the team and let things run its course, this probably all gets sorted out.
If a deal didn't happen, it's not like he's not good enough for it to happen again.
Liverpool wouldn't have just dropped their interest. He's not a one season wonder. He's a quality player.
A deal would eventually have happened, even if it wouldn't have happened in this window. Someone would always want to buy a player of Isak's quality.
He just needed to get his head down, train well, score goals when presented with the chance and this could have been so different for him.
After the work he's done at the club, he could have left a hero. But now, a lot of people associated with Newcastle are going to think differently, and that's a shame because of what he has achieved at St James' Park.

'Only one place I wanted to go' - Grealish joins Everton on loan,Everton sign Manchester City and England winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz93j5vxy55o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:17:43",Tom Mallows,['Manchester City'],"Jack Grealish says ""there is only one place he wanted to go"" after signing for Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City.
The 29-year-old becomes Everton's sixth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Charly Alcaraz, Thierno Barry, Mark Travers and Adam Aznou.
He says talks with Toffees manager David Moyes were decisive in him choosing to move to Hill Dickinson Stadium.
""I'm over the moon to have signed for Everton - it's massive for me, honestly. This is a great club, with great fans,"" said the England winger.
""As soon as I spoke to the manager, I knew there was only one place that I wanted to go. On social media, I've been flooded with messages from Everton supporters, so there's that side of it as well and that's another reason why I chose Everton.
""I want to say thank you to the fans for all of the messages I've had already. Thank you for all of the love and support. I hope I can repay you now and I'm sure I will.""
Grealish is in line to make his Everton debut in their Premier League opener at Leeds on Monday.
The England playmaker joined City from Aston Villa for what was a British record fee of £100m in August 2021 and has made more than 150 appearances for the club - winning three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.
But he fell out of favour last season, making only seven league starts before being left out of their squad for the Club World Cup in the United States.
A move to Everton gives him the chance to rejuvenate his career and take centre stage at their new stadium.
Grealish will also be aiming to win his place back in the England squad - something Moyes hopes Everton can help him achieve - after saying last summer he was ""heartbroken"" by being left out of the squad for the 2024 European Championship.
Everton boss Moyes said: ""I think we're getting him at a good time because he's experienced, he understands the Premier League and we're all fully aware of the levels he's capable of performing to.
""We're all looking forward to working with him and providing a platform for him to show the best version of himself.""
Grealish to follow Rooney and Gascoigne
Grealish will wear the number 18 shirt and says he chose that number so he could emulate two of his favourite players.
""There is a reason [for choosing number 18],"" said Grealish. ""There were other numbers but my two favourite English players ever are Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne and I know they both wore number 18 here.
""So, as soon as I knew this deal was close, I had a look and number 18 was free, so that was perfect for me and it was the only number I was going to take from that point.
""I spoke to Wayne [Rooney] before I came here and I mentioned that to him - about the number 18 - so I hope he's happy as well.""
Where will Grealish play at Everton?
Matthew Hobbs, BBC Sport:
Jack Grealish's signature is a real coup for David Moyes, but will the 29-year-old be more effective on the left or in a central role for the Toffees?
According to Opta, Moyes commonly employed a 4-2-3-1 formation in the Premier League after returning to Goodison Park last season, doing so 11 times in 19 matches and only really deviating when a back three was used instead.
Grealish has predominantly had a left-sided role during his top-flight career, spending 80% of his 5,698 Premier League playing minutes on the left wing at Manchester City.
In the top flight at Aston Villa, he played on the left 64% of the time, and 20% at number 10.
While Grealish is a statement signing sure to excite supporters, it does create an imbalance in Everton's squad, with the search for a right-winger so far unsuccessful.
Iliman Ndiaye played 2,350 minutes on the left wing last term and finished as the club's top scorer, while Dwight McNeil has also been a key performer in that role.
Should Grealish start on the left it may mean Ndiaye, McNeil and summer signing Carlos Alcaraz competing for the number 10 berth - or one playing out of position until a natural right-winger is recruited.
Moyes typically demands hard work off the ball, so if Grealish plays centrally in a position operated by Abdoulaye Doucoure last season, he may be required to do more defending than perhaps suits his natural game.

The people and places that made Liverpool icon Salah,"BBC Sport visits Egypt to discover what Mohamed Salah means to the people of the football-mad country, and how a small boy from humble beginnings became a national icon.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2xlk74llno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 05:36:01",John Bennett,['Liverpool'],"""Whenever I walk in here, I can't help but recall how he used to move and the way he controlled the ball. It was something else.""
One of Mohamed Salah's first coaches is opening the all-new dark green gates of the youth centre in Nagrig, a village about three hours north of Cairo. This is where it all began for one of the world's most prolific forwards - a player who propelled Liverpool to the Premier League title in May.
It was on the streets of Nagrig where a seven-year-old Salah, external would play football with his friends, pretending to be Brazil striker Ronaldo, France's legendary playmaker Zinedine Zidane or Italian maestro Francesco Totti.
""Mohamed was small compared to his team-mates, but he was doing things even the older boys couldn't manage,"" Ghamry Abd El-Hamid El-Saadany says as he points to the artificial pitch which is now named in Salah's honour.
""His shots were incredibly powerful, and it was obvious that he had determination and drive.""
Salah, 33, is about to embark on his ninth season at Liverpool, where the winger has scored a remarkable 245 goals in 402 league and cup appearances since joining in 2017.
Egypt's first global football superstar has won every domestic honour as well as the Champions League with the Reds, but has yet to taste success with his country.
With the Africa Cup of Nations in December and the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, BBC Sport visited Egypt to discover what Salah means to the people of the football-mad country of 115 million, and how a small boy from humble beginnings became a national icon.
""I still feel my father's joy when I watch Salah,"" says Lamisse El-Sadek, at the Dentists Cafe in the east of Cairo. ""After Salah joined Liverpool, we used to watch every match on television together.""
The cafe is named after the former owner's original profession and is now where Liverpool fans gather to watch matches on the big screen.
Lamisse is wearing a Liverpool shirt with her father's name on the back. ""He sadly passed away two years ago,"" she adds.
""Every Liverpool game was some of the happiest two hours in our household every week and even if I had to miss some of the game due to school or work, my father used to text me minute-by-minute updates.
""Salah didn't come from a class of privilege. He really worked hard and sacrificed a lot to reach where he is now. A lot of us see ourselves in him.""
You can listen to the full version of Mohamed Salah: The Egyptian King here.
'All the kids want to be Salah'
The small farming village of Nagrig in the Egyptian Nile Delta is nestled in swathes of green fields, growing jasmine and watermelons. Water buffalos, cows and donkeys share dirt roads with cars, motorbikes and horse-drawn carts.
It is here where one of the world's best and most prolific forwards, affectionately known as the 'Egyptian King', spent his early years.
""Salah's family is the foundation and secret behind his success,"" adds El-Saadany, who calls himself Salah's first coach after nurturing him when he was eight years old.
""They still live here with humility, values and respect. That's one reason people love them so much.""
The youth centre has been given an impressive upgrade recently in tribute to the village's most famous son, and the green playing surface would not look out of place at a professional training ground.
""They [Salah's family] made many sacrifices when he was young,"" says El-Saadany, who is standing next to a huge photograph that hangs behind one of the goals, showing Salah with the Champions League trophy.
""They were incredibly supportive from the very beginning, especially his father and his uncle, who is actually chairman of this centre.""
Salah's footprint is everywhere in Nagrig, where children run around wearing Liverpool and Egypt shirts with the player's name and number on the back.
There is a mural of Salah outside his old school, while a tuk-tuk rushes past beeping its horn with a large sticker of the player smiling on the front.
In the heart of Nagrig is the barber's shop where a teenage Salah would get his hair cut after training.
""I'm the one who gave him that curly hairstyle and the beard,"" says Ahmed El Masri.
""His friends told him not to get his hair cut here because we're from a village not a city, but he'd always come to me. The next day his friends would be surprised [at how good he looked] and ask him 'who's your barber?'.""
The hairdresser recalls watching Salah's skills at the youth centre and on the streets of the village.
""The big thing I remember most is that when we all played PlayStation, Salah would always choose to be Liverpool,"" he adds. ""The other boys would choose Manchester United or Barcelona, but he'd always be Liverpool.
""All the young kids now living in the village want to be like him.""
Salah's football education included a six-year spell at Cairo-based club Arab Contractors, also known as Al Mokawloon.
He joined them at the age of 14 and the story of Salah being given permission to leave school early to make daily round trips, taking many hours, to train and play for Arab Contractors has become legendary in Egypt and beyond.
Shaped by a famous bus journey
A couple of the passengers on board the cramped, seven-seater Suzuki van on the edge of Nagrig are getting jittery.
""Are they getting on or not?""
This is not a bus service which runs to a timetable. In fact, the driver only leaves when it fills up.
As a teenager this bus stop was where Salah started his long journey to training at  Arab Contractors. ""It was a tough journey and also incredibly expensive,"" El-Saadany says.
""He depended on himself and travelled alone most of the time. Imagine a child leaving at 10am and not returning until midnight. That journey required someone strong; only someone with a clear goal could bear such a burden.""
When we do jump on the bus, we are squeezed at the back behind a mother and her two sons and we head in the direction of a city called Basyoun, the first stop on Salah's regular journey to Cairo.
He would then jump on another bus to Tanta, before changing again to get to the Ramses bus station in Cairo where there would be another switch before finally reaching his destination.
After the early evening sessions it was time for the same long trip back to Nagrig and the same regular changes in reverse.
The white microbuses darting around the roads at all hours are one of the first things you notice when you arrive in Cairo, packed with travellers hopping on and hopping off.
""These vehicles handle around 80% of commuters in a city home to over 10 million people,"" Egyptian journalist Wael El-Sayed explains.
""There are thousands of these vans working 24/7.""
Just the small journey to Basyoun is tough in hot and uncomfortable conditions at the back of the bus, so you can only imagine how challenging the much longer journey, several times a week, would have been for a teenage Salah.
The coach who gave Salah his first international cap believes such experiences have helped provide the player with the mentality to succeed at the top level.
""To start as a football player here in Egypt is very hard,"" says Hany Ramzy.
Ramzy was part of the Egypt side that faced England, external at the 1990 World Cup and spent 11 years playing in the Bundesliga. He handed Salah his senior Egypt debut in October 2011 when he was interim manager of the national side.
He was also in charge of the Egypt Under-23 team that Salah played in at the London 2012 Olympics.
""I also had to take buses and walk five or six kilometres to get to my first club of Al Ahly and my father couldn't afford football boots for me,"" adds Ramzy.
""Salah playing at the top level and staying at the top level for so many years was 100% shaped by this because this kind of life builds strong players.""
'Don't defend!'
Driving into Cairo over one of its busiest bridges, a huge electronic billboard flicks from an ice cream advert to a picture of Salah next to the Arabic word 'shukran', which means 'thank you'.
Waiting at a nearby office is Diaa El-Sayed, one of the most influential coaches in Salah's early career.
He was the coach when Salah made his first impact on the global stage, at the 2011 Under-20 World Cup in Colombia.
""The country wasn't stable, there was a revolution, so preparing for the tournament was tough for us,"" says the man everyone calls 'Captain Diaa'.
""Salah came with us and the first thing that stood out was his speed and that he was always concentrating. He's gone far because he listens so well, no arguments with anyone, always listening and working, listening and working. He deserves what he has.""
'Captain Diaa' recalls telling a young Salah to stay away from his own penalty area and just concentrate on attacking.
""Then against Argentina, external he came back to defend in the 18-yard box and gave away a penalty,"" he says, laughing.
""I told him, 'don't defend, why are you in our box? You can't defend!'.
""After Liverpool won the Premier League title last season, I heard him saying Arne Slot tells him not to defend. But I was the first coach who told him not to defend.""
Egypt's 'greatest ambassador'
Salah has played for the senior national team for 14 years and his importance to Egypt is such that high-ranking government officials have been known to get involved when he has been injured.
""I even had calls from Egypt's Minister of Health,"" recalls Dr Mohamed Aboud, the national team's medic, about the time Salah suffered a serious shoulder injury in Liverpool's defeat to Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final, leading to speculation he could miss the World Cup in Russia a few weeks later.
""I told him not to panic, everything is going well.""
Speaking from his medical clinic in the Maadi area of Egypt's capital, Dr Aboud adds: ""I was younger and the pressure from inside the country was intense.
""I had calls from so many people trying to help. One of our board members told me I was now one of the most important people in the whole world.
""This situation changed me as a person.""
For the record, Salah did recover to play in two of his country's three group games but was unable to prevent Egypt from making a quick exit after defeats to Uruguay, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
""I need to tell you that Salah was involved in every single goal in our 2018 World Cup qualification campaign,"" says former Egypt assistant coach Mahmoud Fayez at his home on the outskirts of Cairo.
Salah had scored a dramatic 95th-minute penalty against Congo in Alexandria to secure a 2-1 win and book Egypt's place at the World Cup, with one qualifying game to spare, for the first time in 28 years.
In a nail-biting game, Salah put Egypt ahead before Congo equalised three minutes from time.
""Do you know when you can listen to silence? I listened to the silence when Congo scored - 75,000 fans and silence everywhere,"" adds Fayez.
Then came the penalty that turned Salah into a national hero.
""Imagine it, a nation of nearly 120 million waiting for this moment to qualify,"" says Fayez. ""He had the toughest and most difficult moment for one player, a penalty in the 95th minute that Mohamed had to score.
""He scored it and he made us all proud. In the dressing room afterwards he started to dance, hug everyone and he was shouting 'we did it, we did it', after 28 years, we did it.""
In Cairo is a football academy called 'The Maker', founded and run by former Tottenham and Egypt striker Mido, who is hoping to produce players who will follow in Salah's footsteps.
""I played for the national team in front of 110,000 people when I was only 17, the youngest player to represent Egypt,"" Mido says. ""I love to feel that people depend on me and Salah is the same.""
At the time of our visit, a classroom lesson for young players about the mindset required to become a top professional is taking place.
Underneath Salah's name on a whiteboard, one of the coaches has written ""discipline, dedication and motivation"".
""The reason Salah is where he is now is because he works on his mental strength daily,"" Mido adds.
""He is the greatest ambassador for Egypt and for African players as well. He made European clubs respect Arab players, this is what Salah has done.
""I think a lot of European clubs now, when they see a young player from Egypt, they think of Salah. He has made our young players dream.""
Giving back to where it all started
Back to Nagrig and we meet Rashida, a 70-year-old who sells vegetables from a small stall. She talks about how Salah has changed her life and the lives of hundreds of other people in the village where he was born and raised.
""Mohamed is a good man. He's respectful and kind, he's like a brother to us,"" Rashida says.
She is one of many people in the village who have benefited from the work of Salah's charity, which gives back to the place where his journey to football stardom started.
""The aim is to help orphans, divorced and widowed women, the poor, and the sick,"" says Hassan Bakr from the Mohamed Salah Charity Foundation.
""It provides monthly support, meals and food boxes on holidays and special occasions. For example [with Rashida] there's a supplement to the pension a widow receives.
""When Mohamed is here he stays humble, walking around in normal clothes, never showing off. People love him because of his modesty and kindness.""
As well as the charity helping people like Rashida, Salah has funded a new post office to serve the local community, an ambulance unit, a religious institute and has donated land for a sewage station, among other projects.
When Liverpool won the English league title for a record-equalling 20th time last season, fans turned up at a local cafe in Nagrig to watch on television and celebrate the village's famous son.
With there be more celebrations in Salah's home village in 2025-26?
Despite helping Liverpool to the Premier League title in 2019-20 and 2024-25, the player has yet to lift a trophy for his country.
The generation before Salah won three Africa Cup of Nations titles in a row between 2006 and 2010. Since then, there have been two defeats in finals, against Cameroon in 2017 and Senegal in the 2021 edition, which took place in early 2022.
With the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations starting on 21 December - six months before the World Cup - do Egyptians feel that the 33-year-old now needs to deliver on the international stage?
""Salah has already done his legacy. He's the greatest Egyptian footballer in our history,"" says Mido.
""He doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, he's a legend for Liverpool and a legend for Egypt.""

'Glass half-full' & 'enthralled by details' - Spurs' new era under Frank,BBC senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel looks at how Tottenham are shaping up for the season under new manager Thomas Frank.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr4eqzggwqgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:37:30",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"What is it they say about London buses?
Tottenham waited 17 years for their first trophy. By the end of Wednesday night, they could have clinched their second in three months.
With last season's Europa League triumph still fresh in the memory, opportunity beckons for new manager Thomas Frank to not only get his first season in charge off to a flying start, but to chalk off the first major milestone.
Of course, success against Champions League winners Paris St-Germain is likely to have little bearing on how the next nine months develop.
But victory against the European champions would certainly garner immediate buy-in from players, colleagues and supporters.
Not that Frank is having trouble in making a good first impression.
A few days after his appointment, Frank called a first-team meeting at the club's Enfield training headquarters.
This is standard fare - an opportunity for 'tracksuit staff' to acquaint themselves with the new coaching team and for the manager to start laying down his philosophy.
But this was a gathering with a twist.
Frank invited everyone - from the technical and non-technical staff in the building who have contact with the first-team squad to the catering, administration and cleaning staff.
It may have been a small gesture, but it did not go unnoticed behind the scenes.
Frank's ethos of inclusivity
This kind of inclusive effort is indicative of how Frank operates.
Those who worked with him at Brentford could recall similar anecdotes about Frank's keenness to nurture a sense of inclusivity.
A source describes the Dane as a glass half-full type of manager. He is said to be an emotionally available individual - not necessarily a given in the unforgiving confines of professional football.
That is not to say his predecessor Ange Postecoglou wasn't. The gushing appraisals and messages that followed his sacking were a clear indication of the strength of feeling towards him.
But it has been noticeable during Frank's opening weeks in the job just how determined he is to emphasise the collective.
At the heart of his ethos is the notion that, regardless of position at the club, everyone should be treated the same. There should be no preferential treatment - every member of staff is part of the journey.
His decision to leave Yves Bissouma in London for persistent lateness before the PSG match is indicative of his straight approach. His culture is rooted in hard work and honesty, and that means being upfront with issues.
If someone has a problem, Frank expects that person to air it openly. He won't accept backstabbing or whispers.
Frank is at the centre of each day's training session. He will delegate elements of daily coaching to his staff, but he is said to be the protagonist in most sessions.
That is a clear step away from Postecoglou's regime - where the Australian would observe most training days at the side of the pitch during the week, before taking the reins on the final session before a match.
Frank is enthralled by details. His attention to the smallest of tactical specifics has already surprised members of the team and, even in largely meaningless pre-season friendlies, his tactical clipboard has stayed close to hand.
Frank having significant say in transfers
Frank's preparations, whether it be his team composition or bedding in his philosophy, have been hampered during pre-season.
He has been without Dominic Solanke and Destiny Udogie for much of the summer, while Dejan Kulusevski is yet to feature because of injury.
Frank has also lost James Maddison to an ACL injury, while captain Heung-min Son has left for Los Angeles FC.
While setting the tone for team spirit has been evident, Frank's long-term vision of how he wants Tottenham to play is, arguably, less clear.
Sources have indicated that summer signing Mohammed Kudus is becoming a key player for Frank, with an emerging pattern of trying to get the ball into the Ghana international as often as possible.
Frank will also drill his team to be flexible. Don't be shocked to see him start games with a back three and finish with a four.
The 51-year-old is also having a significant say in the club's transfer business.
He is said to have been a driving force behind the deal for Kudus, while the club's efforts to sign Savinho from Manchester City are described as having Frank's seal of approval.
Nevertheless, the window hasn't been without its difficulties.
The high-profile pursuit of Nottingham Forest attacker Morgan Gibbs-White - and its ultimate failure owing to legal issues related to the England international's £60m release clause - was a blow.
Spurs would also like to sign Marc Guehi, but the Crystal Palace captain prefers Liverpool as a destination.
So far, only Kudus and Joao Palhinha - on a season-long loan from Bayern Munich - have arrived.
For some supporters, that isn't enough.
Talks of fan protests at the perceived lack of squad investment has been an unwanted narrative that has followed the club this summer, since the move for Gibbs-White fell through.
There is money to spend, with owners Enic understood to have injected a level of cash into the club.
Landing Savinho and Palace attacker Eberechi Eze - who Tottenham have held talks over - would go some way to appeasing disgruntled supporters.
""This transfer window, we are definitely in the market and will do everything we can to make the best possible and strong squad,"" Frank added.
""There are a few things in the air, shall we say, along the way.""

Liverpool stepping up bid to sign Palace's Guehi,Liverpool step up their bid to sign Crystal Palace and England centre-back Marc Guehi.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ypkrgp8p6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:29:16",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have held initial talks with a view to signing Crystal Palace and England centre-back Marc Guehi this summer.
Palace captain Guehi has a year left on his contract, but chairman Steve Parish said earlier this week he could be sold to avoid him moving on a free transfer in 12 months' time.
Sources have told BBC Sport that Liverpool are looking to sign the 25-year-old before the summer transfer window shuts.
If the clubs do agree a deal for Guehi, the defender may need to be persuaded that a move to Anfield is the right one for him.
Aside from the financial element of his personal terms, the level of playing time he will be afforded will also be a factor.
The defender is a regular at Palace and, in a World Cup year, first-team football will be a crucial consideration for the centre-back.
Liverpool are also trying to sign 18-year-old Parma centre-back Giovanni Leoni.
The Italy Under-19 international is not seen as a potential rival for Guehi but more as one for the future.
He began his career at Padova and had a short spell at Sampdoria before joining Parma last summer.
Guehi has made more than 150 appearances for Palace since joining from Chelsea in 2021.
He won the first of his 23 England caps in 2022 and was part of the Three Lions squad that reached the Euro 2024 final.
Guehi was the subject of bids topping out at £65m from Newcastle last year.
FA Cup winners Palace are believed to want £40m for him now, given he only has 12 months left on his contract, but Liverpool want to pay less than that.
The Reds have already spent about £270m this summer, though they have recouped about £170m through player sales.
They have also had a £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle, though sources have told BBC Sport the Swede remains determined to move to Anfield.
Signing Guehi and Isak would take Liverpool's summer spending above £400m.
'It's Liverpool or nothing for Guehi' - analysis
Ultimately for Guehi, it is Liverpool or nothing this summer.
That isn't an ideal scenario for Crystal Palace, who were hoping for an auction. But the alternative is losing him for nothing next summer - when he may end up joining the Reds on a free transfer anyway.
While Palace ideally want £40m for Guehi, it may be that they get a deal worth around £35m plus add-ons.
The south London club have reluctantly engaged in talks to sell their captain and if all goes to plan, an agreement should follow in the coming days.
Parish will sanction Guehi's sale through gritted teeth.
He'd like the defender to stay and sign a new deal, but the likelihood of that is virtually non-existent.
Selling to Liverpool - or losing Guehi for nothing - now appear to be Palace's only options.

PSG look to add fifth trophy against Tottenham,"One month after the end of the best season in their history, Paris St-Germain kick off the new one with the chance to win yet another trophy, against Tottenham.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clym8gr79vmo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 07:06:43",Emlyn Begley,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"One month after the end of the best season in their history, Paris St-Germain kick off the new one with the chance to win yet another trophy.
The French club won the Treble last season, including their first Champions League trophy, but lost 3-0 to Chelsea in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey last month.
Now the European champions face another London club, as they meet Europa League winners Tottenham in Udine, Italy in the Uefa Super Cup.
Playing fantastic football with a young, hungry squad, PSG blew nearly everyone away in the latter stages of last season with devastating pace, passing and pressing - and look like a team who could dominate for some time to come.
They will hope that Chelsea defeat was just a blip - it came six weeks after they demolished Inter Milan 5-0 in the most one-sided Champions League final ever.
In the US they also won 4-0 against both Madrid sides, Atletico and Real - and saw off Bayern Munich despite ending with nine men.
The trophies...
PSG have the chance to win a joint-record six trophies in a calendar year. Losing to Chelsea ended the opportunity for a historic seven.
Beat Spurs and it would be PSG's sixth trophy of 2025, including the Trophee des Champions - France's version of the Community Shield - in which PSG beat Monaco 1-0 in Doha in January.
The Ligue 1 title was clinched on 5 April, with six games to go, and the club still unbeaten. They lost two of their final four games in the league, but the trophy was already in the bag.
PSG beat Reims 3-0 in the French Cup final to complete a domestic Double - and then beat Inter 5-0 in the Champions League final in Munich to secure the Treble.
If they beat Spurs, they then have the chance for that joint-record sixth piece of silverware when they play one of the other continental champions (who have to fight their way through qualifying rounds) in the Fifa Intercontinental Cup final in December.
Barcelona - in 2009 - and Bayern Munich -  in 2020 - are the only two teams to have won six trophies in a calendar year.
That was the maximum either side could win at the time, with the Fifa Club World Cup in its previous form - when it was the continental champions who took part - being considered the forerunner of the Intercontinental Cup.
The new Club World Cup, featuring 32 teams from around the world, is considered to be a new competition - and the seventh piece of silverware now up for grabs each season.
The young players
The worrying thing for PSG's rivals is the youth of their team.
They named the youngest starting XI in a Champions League final in the 21st century - 25 years and 96 days - and beat Inter Milan by the biggest margin of victory in a European Cup final ever.
Most of their players are just approaching their peak years, while forward Desire Doue - who scored twice against Inter - and midfielder Joao Neves are just 20.
Their oldest regular player is captain and centre-back Marquinhos, who turned 31 in May.
However, Chelsea had an even younger team when they beat PSG at the MetLife Stadium in July.
Best front line, best midfield, best defence, best goalkeeper?
There is no position on the pitch that PSG look weak in.
Their rapid front three of Dembele, Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia cause problems for any opponent.
The passing and running of midfield trio Fabian Ruiz and Portugal duo Neves and Vitinha is hard to play against.
On either side of their back four are arguably the two best full-backs in the world - Nuno Mendes and Achraf Hakimi - who both play almost as wingers at times.
And in the centre, Marquinhos is one of the world's best defenders - and plays alongside 23-year-old Ecuadoarian Willian Pacho (who was suspended for the Chelsea defeat).
In goal is Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is also one of the best on the globe in his position - and still only aged 26.
How Enrique binned the egos and turned it around
One major plot in the story of PSG's upturn has been the binning of the egos.
At one time the Parisians had three of the world's best players up front - Neymar, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe.
All wanted to be centre stage. None helped the club win the Champions League.
And Messi, with Inter Miami, and Mbappe, with Real Madrid, both got a close look at what PSG have become without them - with the French side beating both of their new teams 4-0 in the knockout stages of the Club World Cup.
PSG are still shelling out the money on transfers, but instead of going for star names they have recruited talented youngsters.
Last summer, Portugal midfielder Neves cost £50m from Benfica, Doue was a £42m recruit from Rennes and Pacho cost roughly £42m from Eintracht Frankfurt.
All highly talented youngsters, but none would have been household names before PSG came knocking.
But things really picked up when their one big January signing, Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, came in for £59m.
Dembele finds top form
One of Luis Enrique's biggest achievements has been turning Dembele into a player who is now considered the leading candidate to win the Ballon d'Or.
His previous club, Barcelona, shelled out £96.8m for him but never saw the best of the 28-year-old - his highest number of goals in a season for them was 14.
It appeared his career was never going to live up to the early hype.
In England, he was perhaps best known for missing a huge chance to put Barca 4-0 up against Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League semi-finals. The Reds went on to win 4-3 on aggregate.
But now his name has become synonymous with being one of the most exciting and devastating players in the world - thanks to one tactical switch.
In mid-December Enrique played Dembele as a number nine instead of on the right wing in a league game against Lyon.
He had scored five goals in 2024-25 before that date - and then went on a run of 18 goals in 10 matches.
""It was genius because everyone saw him as a winger,"" said L'Equipe journalist Pierre-Etienne Minonzio.
""He imagined for him a new role like a false nine with a lot of press. He's very demanding with what he asks of him and Dembele managed to do it perfectly well.
""It's very hardy to find a number nine who can do what Luis Enrique asks.""
Dembele ended the season, including the Club World Cup, on 35 goals and 16 assists in 53 games.
He was the Champions League's player of the season and Ligue 1's Golden Boot winner - in addition to all those trophies.
Could they become one of the great club sides?
Bar perhaps Marquinhos, who is 31, Ruiz, 29, and Dembele, 28, there is nothing to stop PSG keeping this team together for the next six years.
Do that - and add some more players in the coming years - and they could take some stopping.
They are not planning any big signings this summer, despite earning prize money of about £78m in the Club World Cup alone, having learned lessons from the past.
""What we know is they won't want to make a huge transfer with all the money they have earned from the Club World Cup,"" said journalist Minonzio.
""It's not the idea to do what they did in the past and buy someone like Neymar, the huge names.""
This PSG team are sensational to watch when they get going - and will take some stopping.
Unless other teams can learn from what Chelsea did in the final and repeat the trick.
""The idea was go man-to-man because if you leave spaces to PSG they will kill you, so we tried to be very aggressive and suffocate them early on and that intensity was crucial in the first 10 minutes,"" Blues boss Enzo Maresca said.
""We had a lot of success exploring the left side of their defence. Things worked perfectly for us due to the effort the players put in.""
As a benchmark, only four clubs have ever managed to win three European Cups in a five-year spell - Real Madrid, Ajax (1971-1973), Bayern Munich (1974-1976) and Liverpool (1977, 1978, 1981).
Real have done it three times - including winning the first five (1956-1960), and four out of five between 2014 and 2018.
And AC Milan and Barcelona both managed three in the space of six years.
PSG could themselves be about to embark on a run of dominance, but equally fatigue could be an issue in 2025-26.
They played 65 games in all competitions last season - and there is only one month between the Club World Cup final and Uefa Super Cup.

Newcastle striker Isak still determined to join Liverpool,Newcastle striker Alexander Isak is still determined to join Premier League champions Liverpool before the transfer window closes.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czxp05re72po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 14:47:55",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Alexander Isak is still determined to leave Newcastle United and join Liverpool this summer.
The Athletic reported on Tuesday, external the striker, 25, was ""adamant he will never represent Newcastle again"".
BBC Sport has not been able to verify this, but it is understood it is still the Swede's ""determined"" ambition to join the Premier League champions before the deadline closes on 1 September.
The Magpies rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool for Isak on 1 August, with the Reds subsequently claiming that they were prepared to walk away from a deal.
Liverpool have also stepped up their attempts to sign Crystal Palace and England centre-back Marc Guehi, 25.
Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said following a pre-season friendly defeat by Atletico Madrid that ""everything is in play"" when it comes to Isak's future, but stressed it was ""clear"" he ""cannot involve"" the striker in his current plans.
As such, Isak is expected to miss Newcastle's Premier League opener at Aston Villa on Saturday (12:30pm BST).
The former Dortmund forward missed Newcastle's pre-season tour of the far-east with a ""minor"" thigh injury.
He then trained alone at former club Real Sociedad, before returning to the UK last week.
Isak, who scored 27 goals in 42 appearances across all competitions last season, has three years to run on his deal in the north east.
Newcastle have failed with several moves for strikers this summer, with Liam Delap opting to join Chelsea, Benjamin Sesko choosing Manchester United and Hugo Ekitike moving to Liverpool.
Interest remains in Brentford striker Yoane Wissa, who left the Bees' pre-season camp in Portugal in July because of his desire to join Newcastle.
The 28-year-old returned to first-team training last week following constructive talks with head coach Keith Andrews.
But the DR Congo striker remains keen on moving to Newcastle should a fee be agreed.
Howe's side are also closing in on the signing of AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw.
The German centre-back is due to fly to Tyneside on Sunday night to finalise his £34.62m move to St James' Park.

"Critics motivate me, says 'heartbroken' Maddison","Tottenham midfielder James Maddison says the people who ""doubt, hate and mock"" him will only motivate him to come back stronger from his serious knee injury.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8jpmpwmmd3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 20:23:54",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham midfielder James Maddison says the people who ""doubt, hate and mock"" him will only motivate him to come back stronger from a serious knee injury.
The 28-year-old suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the pre-season draw against Newcastle in South Korea earlier this month.
Maddison, who is expected to miss the majority of the new season, said his ACL reconstruction surgery was successful.
While he thanked family, friends and fans who had reached out across social media to offer support for his recovery, Maddison added: ""Lastly to those of you who doubt, hate and mock. You truly motivate me to levels I didn't know I had inside of me so again, thank you. See you all on the other side.""
Maddison, who won the last of his seven England caps in 2024, injured the same knee that ruled him out of the Europa League final victory against Manchester United in May.
Posting on Instagram,, external he said the injury was the ""lowest low I've ever had"".
""Heartbroken at the fact this injury has occurred at this time in my career,"" wrote Maddison.
""With the [Uefa] Super Cup tomorrow, the Premier League season on the horizon, the exciting Champions League campaign and it being a World Cup year for England it all feels very, very cruel.""
Tottenham face Champions League winners Paris St-Germain in the Super Cup final on Wednesday, before hosting Burnley in Saturday's opening Premier League fixture.
Maddison joined the club from Leicester City in 2023 and scored 12 goals in 45 appearances for the north London club last season.
Tottenham are interested in Eberechi Eze as they look to strengthen their side following Maddison's injury.

Tottenham interested in Crystal Palace's Eze,"Tottenham are weighing up a bid for Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze, having lost midfielder James Maddison to injury for most of the upcoming season.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c36jkpl22rdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 08:20:41",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham are exploring a deal for Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze.
Thomas Frank is looking to bolster his options in the final third after attacking midfielder James Maddison was ruled out for the majority of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.
South Korea forward Son Heung-min left the club after 10 years earlier this month having scored 173 goals in 454 appearances, while midfielder Dejan Kulusevski is still out after knee surgery.
Eze scored 14 goals across all competitions for Palace last season, including in their 1-0 win against Manchester City in the FA Cup final.
Asked directly about Eze in a news conference before Wednesday's Uefa Super Cup against Paris St-Germain, Frank said: ""I think there are a lot of good players out there.
""There are also a few from the PSG team but I don't think we can buy them right now.
""In general, players in or players out, I always speaking about something that is done or not done. In general, I will speak about my own players.""
Eze, 27, made his England debut in 2023 and has won 11 caps for the Three Lions, including three appearances at Euro 2024.
Tottenham are also in talks with Manchester City over a move for Savinho but multiple sources have indicated Eze is now emerging as a player of serious interest for Spurs.
There is no confirmation whether Tottenham will look to progress with deals for both Brazil winger Savinho and Eze.
Arsenal also have an interest in Eze but are currently looking at trying to move players on, with the likes of Leandro Trossard, Reiss Nelson and Fabio Vieira set to leave.
It remains to be seen whether Tottenham's active interest in Eze results in Arsenal accelerating a move for the England international.
Eze joined Palace from Queens Park Rangers in a deal worth £19.5m in 2020 and has scored 40 goals in 168 appearances.
His contract at Selhurst Park is due to expire in the summer of 2027.
How could Eze fit in at Spurs?
Eze has improved his total number of goals and assists in each of the past three seasons and scored or created 26 goals in all competitions last term, the highest figure of his career.
That growth has been aided by his switch from the left wing to a more central role as one of two attacking midfielders in the 3-4-2-1 formation used by Palace boss Oliver Glasner.
Eze finished last season with a flourish, becoming the first player to score in six consecutive appearances for Palace since Darren Ambrose in 2009.
If he moves to Tottenham, Eze could also play centrally as the attacking midfielder in Frank's 4-2-3-1 system, filling the creative void left by Maddison's knee injury.
Maddison and Eze both created two chances per 90 minutes in the most recent Premier League campaign, though Maddison's passing range means he is perhaps better suited to stretching play.
He averaged 3.9 long passes and 8.6 passes into the final third per 90 last season, compared to corresponding figures of 2.3 and 4 for Eze. While Eze gets on the ball less because of Palace's counter-attacking style, Maddison appears the more progressive passer.
Eze, meanwhile, has the edge in terms of running with the ball, averaging 4.6 dribbles to Maddison's 3.4, with a similar advantage when it comes to taking on players in the opposition half.
Another option would be to use Eze as a replacement for Son on the wings, where he could compete for a starting spot with Mohammed Kudus, Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel.
One of Son's biggest strengths was his finishing ability with either foot. The South Korean attempted 33 shots with his right in the league last season and 24 with his left. Though not quite at that level, Eze is also relatively good with both feet, registering 72 right-footed efforts and 28 off his left.
Regardless of where Eze may operate, Spurs would be getting a player who excels in wriggling his way out of tight spaces and making things happen. Eze ranked highly for most combined shots and chances created in the Premier League last season, with only a handful of big names faring better.

Thomas Frank eyes chance for Spurs to take star billing on Super Cup stage,"New head coach hopes team steal limelight on Wednesday against PSG, who only returned to training last week",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/thomas-frank-eyes-chance-for-spurs-to-take-star-billing-on-super-cup-stage,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 07:00:42",Nick Ames,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"For your first trick, please show us Tottenham can trade blows with the best team Europe has produced this decade. If Thomas Frank wanted to make a statement two months after crossing London then defeating Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night would set this season’s bar for performance somewhere beyond the stratosphere. His new role, or at least the relentless public scrutiny of it, begins in earnest beneath the Friulian foothills and it is an opportunity to form the kind of first impression that leaves a lasting signature.
Hearts have never been won or lost through showings in the Uefa Super Cup, which has traditionally been as much a late-summer beauty parade as a high-octane heave between the previous campaign’s big winners. There is certainly no guarantee that a hot night in the beguiling surroundings of Udine, whose modest solar-powered stadium has been feted for its environmental credentials, provides hard evidence of sustainable progress on the pitch.
Nonetheless there is, as Frank was keen to point out, an opportunity to take.
It may be popularly held that Spurs stumbled upon the Europa League trophy in May; they certainly did not win many marks for artistic impression in doing so and the feat sat in direct contrast to a miserable league season. The latter, after all, is the reason for Frank’s presence.
But it has given an embattled group the vivid afterglow of something all too few sample in the course of a career: the kind of elite-level victory that, harnessed correctly, presents a launchpad to even greater heights.
“We have set the tone, and we want to repeat and do it again,” said goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, who expressed pride at the prospect of appearing in his home city.
“We have tasted the feeling before, and this feeling is amazing. We are there because we have earned the right to be there.”
If they prove that again in front of Uefa’s watching glitterati, the sense of a ship turning around will be sharpened. Frank’s squad has gaping holes, particularly in attack, but the condition in which they have arrived may be a short-term leveller. PSG’s latest final comes exactly a month after their sparkling young group, flat and knackered in their last game of a relentless 2024-25, were comfortably dismissed by Chelsea at the Club World Cup. Their senior players returned to training only last Wednesday; it begs the question of whether they are overcooked or underdone, but in either case this has been the pre-season that never was.
For their part Frank and company have been, to some extent or other, out on the grass since the second week of July. “We have had a more normal pre-season which is what I think every coach would prefer,” Frank said, before countering that by stating the blindly obvious. “Over a whole season, they are probably in a better place to perform better but for one game we will be ready.”
Frank will require evolution from last week’s bleak 4-0 defeat by Bayern Munich and is likely to pick the same starting XI. Cohesion is a must during injury-addled times in which the departure of Son Heung-min has been joined, at the worst possible moment, by hammer blows in the losses of James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski. More of the grit shown in overcoming Arsenal amid the humidity of Singapore will be in order on this occasion. Tottenham’s new captain for the season, who Frank will name before kick-off, will be integral in instilling it.
Results can oscillate wildly at this time of year; performances can be forgiven for that, too, when a new style is being bedded in. The Spurs players must learn on the job and it was instructive to hear Vicario speak openly about the more varied approach Frank, who was never averse to going from back to front at Brentford, will expect from his goalkeepers. “Something has changed,” Vicario said. “I need to read the situation in front of me: sometimes it’s to build from the back and play, sometimes it’s to go long.” Sitting next to him, Ben Davies hinted that the quixotic ways fostered by Ange Postecoglou may be diluted by a shot of pragmatism. “I think we’re definitely going to have a different gameplan depending on the opposition this season,” he said.
When PSG have been banished to memory, whether grisly or glittering, Frank will attend to a bulging in-tray. He must decide what to do with the errant Yves Bissouma but, more importantly for Tottenham’s future, will pray they can get ambitious moves for Eberechi Eze and Savinho over the line.
Those deals would assuage the frontline woes and suggest things are clicking into place more broadly. Earlier in the summer, Frank suggested it would take time to build the degree of understanding he had forged with Brentford’s recruitment staff. It is a process that needs to move swiftly.
Even if definitive judgments must wait, Spurs’ latest new era begins here. “The right time is now, so we need to be ready,” Frank said of their gala assignment. What a boost it would be if they meet the moment again.

Jack Grealish joins Everton on loan and hopes to emulate Rooney and Gascoigne,"‘It’s massive for me, honestly,’ says England winger",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/jack-grealish-joins-everton-on-season-long-loan-from-manchester-city,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 15:48:26",Andy Hunter,['Manchester City'],"David Moyes believes Everton can provide a platform for Jack Grealish to showcase “the best version of himself”, with the midfielder targeting an England recall before the World Cup.
Grealish completed his move from Manchester City on Tuesday on a season’s loan that will cost Everton more than £12m in wages and fees. The 29-year-old had been marginalised at City by Pep Guardiola and was not included in his 27-man squad for the Club World Cup this summer.
The attacking midfielder was also omitted from Gareth Southgate’s squad for the European Championship last summer but Moyes is confident that Grealish, after two seasons of decline at City, can recapture the form that prompted his £100m move to the Etihad Stadium in 2021.
“I think we’re getting him at a good time because he’s experienced, he understands the Premier League, and we’re all fully aware of the levels he’s capable of performing to,” the Everton manager said.
“I know Jack’s ambition is to get back into the England squad so hopefully we can help him achieve that over the course of the season. We’re all looking forward to working with him and providing a platform for him to show the best version of himself.”
Grealish had several offers to leave Manchester this summer, including from Napoli, but was sold on the prospect of relaunching his stalled career in the Premier League with Everton during talks with Moyes. The deal moved swiftly over the weekend once Grealish gave the green light to Everton’s interest.
The England player, who passed a medical on Monday, said: “It’s massive for me, honestly. This is a great club, with great fans. As soon as I spoke to the manager, I knew there was only one place that I wanted to go.
“On social media, I’ve been flooded with messages from Everton supporters, so there’s that side of it as well and that’s another reason why I chose Everton. I want to say thank you to the fans for all of the messages I’ve had already. Thank you for all of the love and support. I hope I can repay you now and I’m sure I will.”
Grealish hopes to feature in Everton’s Premier League opener at Leeds on Monday and has chosen to wear the No 18 shirt. He said: “My two favourite English players ever are Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne and I know they both wore No 18 here.
“So, as soon as I knew this deal was close, I had a look and No 18 was free, so that was perfect for me and it was the only number I was going to take from that point. I spoke to Wayne before I came here and I mentioned that to him – about the No 18 – so I hope he’s happy as well.”

Transfer latest: Liverpool advance Guéhi talks as Manchester United eye Baleba,Liverpool also interested in Parma defender Leoni,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/transfer-latest-manchester-united-eye-brightons-baleba-while-liverpool-track-giovanni-leoni,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 17:16:23",Andy Hunter,"['Manchester United', 'Liverpool']","Liverpool are advancing in talks with Crystal Palace over Marc Guéhi and are considering a move for the Parma centre-half Giovanni Leoni as they attempt to increase Arne Slot’s defensive options.
Guéhi has been Liverpool’s main defensive target all summer and the club were encouraged to make an approach by an admission from the Palace chair, Steve Parish, that it would be better to sell the England international than lose him on a free next summer.
Palace rejected bids of up to £70m from Newcastle for the 25-year-old defender last summer and Liverpool refused to consider the initial asking price at the start of this transfer window. However, with Palace taking a financial hit after losing their Europa League place and Guéhi in the final year of his contract, the Premier League champions hope to secure a deal for £35m. Negotiations are understood to have progressed smoothly on Tuesday.
Liverpool are also interested in the 18-year-old Leoni, who impressed in the second half of last season for Parma and is regarded as one of the best defensive prospects in Europe. The club would like to add him and Guéhi to their squad.
Leoni is also wanted by Inter. Their coach, Cristian Chivu, was in charge at Parma last season and could prove an influential factor in the player’s decision, although Liverpool have greater financial resources. Liverpool are ready to step up their interest in the 6ft 5in defender if they receive encouragement that he is open to leaving Italy. The Merseyside club have not made an approach to Parma.
Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté are the only established central defenders available to Slot for the Premier League opener against Bournemouth on Friday. Liverpool have sold Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen and Joe Gomez missed the final games of pre-season with a minor achilles injury. Slot admitted after the Community Shield penalty shootout defeat against Palace that Liverpool’s defending in pre-season had been a cause for concern.
Manchester United are exploring a move for Carlos Baleba, but are expected to have to pay a transfer record for an African player if they can persuade Brighton to sell the Cameroon midfielder. The 21-year-old has three years on his contract, which Brighton have an option to extend by 12 months.
Sources close to Baleba have indicated he is keen to join United if an agreement can be reached. Brighton are adamant he is not for sale, and it would require an offer well above the £72m Arsenal paid Lille for the Ivory Coast forward Nicolas Pépé in 2019 to tempt them into changing their stance. It may take more than £100m to sign a player rated as one of the best emerging talents in world football.
Any United bid for Baleba is understood to be dependent on players being moved on, with Chelsea still in talks over a deal for Alejandro Garnacho and Milan interested in Rasmus Højlund. They have been trying to offload two others attackers, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who are on big wages. United have spent more than £200m this summer on the forwards Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, another Cameroon international.
Baleba, who joined Brighton in 2023 from Lille for £23m, told the Guardian in March that he was happy at Brighton but said: “I want to be a big midfielder, to be a legend, across the world.”
Brighton’s chief executive, Paul Barber, said last week at a fans’ forum that United had yet to be in touch, but acknowledged Baleba could leave. “Carlos is a fantastic talent,” he said. “We hope he’ll be here for years to come – but it’s subject to the dynamics of the football world, which isn’t always predictable.”
West Ham’s opening offer of £30m for Mateus Fernandes has been rejected by Southampton. Fernandes is their top target in midfield, but the clubs are a long way apart on his valuation and a compromise is not close.
Southampton, who signed Fernandes for £15m from Sporting last year, have quoted £50m for the 21-year-old. West Ham are understood to have offered an initial £28m plus £2m in add-ons. They believe Southampton, one of the favourites for promotion from the Championship, want too much for a player with one season of Premier League football behind him.
West Ham are prepared to explore alternative targets. They like Jacob Ramsey, but face a battle to convince the Aston Villa midfielder to join them. Newcastle have been linked with Ramsey. West Ham are also tracking Lille’s Ngal’ayel Mukau.
Graham Potter wants more energy, dynamism and creativity in midfield. He regards Fernandes as a No 8 and is also keen to bring in a No 6, but West Ham will need sales if they are to sign more than one midfielder. They are struggling to find buyers for Edson Álvarez, Guido Rodríguez and Tomas Soucek. Álvarez is available for £20m, but is on big wages.

Premier League 2025-26 preview No 14: Manchester United,"Ruben Amorim has to turn the ailing club around this season, after £200m on a new forward line, or he could be the next to pay the price",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/premier-league-2025-26-preview-no-14-manchester-united,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 11:00:18",Will Unwin,['Manchester United'],"Guardian writers’ predicted position: 9th (NB: this is not necessarily Will Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)
Last season’s position: 15th
Prospects
The big hope is that Manchester United hit rock bottom last season and things cannot get any worse. They are in effect starting again because ending up 15th in the Premier League resulted in many executives, fans and players waking up in a cold sweat. Expectations within the fanbase are impressively low, not knowing what to expect from a team that stumbled through an entire campaign.
There is no European distraction for Ruben Amorim, allowing him plenty of time on the training ground to get his ideas across. When the Portuguese head coach succeeded Erik ten Hag last November, his role was more firefighter than problem solver. He was allowed to evaluate the squad quickly and made his decision on who were and were not up for the battle that the club found themselves in. Those players have either left or are in the process of doing so, leaving behind those who possess the character, if not the technical expertise, that Amorim thinks can benefit his plans.
Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have arrived in the hope they will ignite an underperforming team and club. United scored a pitiful 44 goals in 38 Premier League games, causing much embarrassment. The pair have the capabilities to create and score goals, skills that were lacking among the players Amorim inherited. After those deals were completed for a combined £130m, the search for a competent No 9 eventually concluded with Benjamin Sesko joining from RB Leipzig for £73.3m to fill the void, leaving plenty of pressure on the new front three.
Winning only seven home games out of 19 last time around was a stain on the club. Amorim will need to ensure his solutions work as they cannot be repeated. Arsenal visit on the opening weekend; the display and the result will provide an indication as to whether things will be different this time around.
The manager
Arriving mid-season is always difficult for a head coach, especially when his ideas did not align with what was available within the squad, but Amorim was insistent on playing 3-4-3 regardless. He was given a relatively free ride because what had gone before was so utterly awful, but a 15th-placed finish and a meek Europa League final loss to Tottenham were clear indicators of the rebuild required. Ideally, Amorim would have carried out a complete overhaul of the squad but finances have dictated otherwise. If things do not start well, he may need to alter his ideals and become more pragmatic, or he may become the latest coach to fail to turn the ship around.
Off-field picture
After a plethora of redundancies and constant cost-cutting measures, United are aiming to return to stable ground soon but these actions do little for the morale of the employees who have stayed. Many more long-serving staff left in the final weeks of last season and over the summer, pleased to get out of the club. A lack of European football will irritate the accountants at Old Trafford but Sir Jim Ratcliffe will hope the promise of a new stadium will appease fans. A lot are angry over an increase in ticket prices and some being forced to move seats, creating an uneasy atmosphere.
Star signing
A lot – but not all – the eggs have been placed in a Cunha-shaped basket. The Brazilian is exactly the sort of player Amorim wanted as one of his No 10s and he has shown at Wolves what he is capable of. He likes the ball at his feet and can do amazing things when he is given the freedom to do so. The Brazilian is a natural talent, a street footballer who has matured into a Premier League player, but one man does not make a team. His temperament has come into question, too, after two suspensions following losses of composure last season, but United need some fire after looking meek for far too long.
Stepping up
Rasmus Højlund really does try extremely hard but does not look up to the job and his scoring record (26 goals in 95 games) reflects that, leaving opportunities for Chido Obi to be Sesko’s support act. Amorim offered Obi opportunities late in the season to come off the bench to try to bring greater energy to the forward line. Obi arrived from Arsenal a year ago, a sign of intent that the club want to bring in high-potential players as part of a long-term strategy. He scored 14 goals across 23 matches in various age groups and will be eager to build on that.
A big season for …
It is quite difficult to pick one individual considering almost no one impressed throughout last season, at least on a consistent basis. Kobbie Mainoo never fitted into what Amorim had planned and was moved around or sat on the bench, while the head coach insisted the England midfielder had plenty to improve on and needed not to listen to the hype. Amorim does not think he can play regularly in the defensive role he was utilised in under Ten Hag, requiring someone with greater mobility in the position, so he will need to decide if he can adapt or he may need to depart.

‘Disappointed and disheartened’ Donnarumma dropped from PSG’s Super Cup squad,Goalkeeper has been linked to Premier League move,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/psg-sign-illia-zabarnyi-bournemouth-transfers-latest,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:47:31",Nick Ames,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United', 'Manchester City']","Luis Enrique has opened the door to a Premier League move for Gianluigi Donnarumma after dropping him from Paris Saint-Germain’s squad for the Super Cup, saying he requires a goalkeeper with different qualities and leaving the Italy captain “disappointed and disheartened”.
Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea have all been linked with moves for Donnarumma, who shone in PSG’s triumphant Champions League run last season. The Ligue 1 winners appear to have signed his replacement in the highly-rated Lucas Chevalier, who joined from Lille last week. Luis Enrique emphasised that the decision to leave Donnarumma behind, and seemingly end his PSG career, had been a technical one.
“These are always difficult decisions to make,” he said. “I can definitely talk about Gigi, because he’s one of the best players in his position, without a doubt. He’s even better as a person. We’re looking for a goalkeeping profile that is different to Donnarumma. It’s always difficult to make the decision in these kinds of situations. My decision is a decision that’s been taken, it’s been supported by my club.”
Donnarumma offered his own perspective in an Instagram post that suggested his manager’s view was not shared. “Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success,” a section of it read. “I am disappointed and disheartened. I hope I have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done. If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.”
Even though Luis Enrique appeared to be implying that Donnarumma’s ability on the ball required improving on, a clamour for the 26-year-old’s services is expected in England and beyond. He has made 74 appearances for his country, winning Euro 2020, and has won four Ligue 1 titles since joining PSG from AC Milan in 2021. Premier League clubs will be on high alert for a player who has entered the last year of his contract and could be available at a cut price.
“If we are champions of Europe, we owe him a lot,” said the PSG captain, Marquinhos. “He is part of this history and always will be. We’re so proud of what he’s done, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts. We don’t know if he’s staying or going yet and if he’s staying we welcome him with open arms.”
PSG hope to back up their thrashing of Inter in Munich by defeating the Europa League winners Tottenham. They have added to their defensive ranks by signing Ilia Zabarnyi, the Ukrainian centre-back, from Bournemouth for an initial £54.5m.
The 22-year-old joined Bournemouth in January 2023 from Dynamo Kyiv and made 86 appearances for the Premier League side. “I’m very happy to join Paris Saint-Germain, the best club in the world, with the best project,” he told the club’s website. “I am here to give everything I have on the pitch and I’m looking forward to making my debut and meeting the fans.”
Bournemouth have been pushing to sign the Lille centre-back Bafodé Diakité as Zabarnyi’s replacement and have generated close to £150m from sales of defenders this summer, with Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen joining Liverpool and Real Madrid respectively.

Spanish football is famed for nothing if not its integrity. Whether it’s Franco using his influence to elevate Real Madrid, in general, but with particular regard to the Di Stéfano affair; the way the government facilitated the sale of Madrid’s training ground for a gazillion euros; Barcelona conjuring then pulling their beloved levers; the way it treats the women’s game, in general but with particular regard to the Luis Rubiales affair; racism more suited to a dissertation or police report than a tea-timely email; to say nothing of the Fuentes blood bags.
But even La Liga has always stayed true to one essential necessity: every team plays every other team twice, once at home and once away … until now, with this season’s Villarreal v Barcelona match, the Yellow Submissives v Mes Que Un Cash Cow, scheduled for Miami. The various suits tried this one a few years ago only for US Soccer to block the move citing a Fifa statute forbidding games from being scheduled outside their home territory. But since then, Relevent Sports – a company that clearly loves the game and, by amazing but unrelated coincidence, recently signed a six-year deal to be Uefa’s global marketing and sales partner for men’s club competitions – and whose owner, by amazing but unrelated coincidence, also owns the Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium – sued both official bodies to make more money for themselves. If you’re still reading, the case eventually settled with the understanding that Fifa would revisit the legislation and, shonuff y’all, as of yesterday they’ve been invited to do so.
This is because Spanish football has had, for many years, el humpo with the Premier League, deeming its financial dominance unfair. This is, of course, hilarious – Real Madrid and Barcelona, its two richest institutions, have won 18 of the last 20 titles with its third-richest, Atlético, claiming the other two; Madrid have won five of the last 10 Bigger Cups; and Spanish clubs have paid eight of the 20 largest transfer fees of all time – but it is also a fact, mid-to-lower ranking Premier League clubs are able to outbid far more successful ones from across Europe. The problem, then, is not one of diagnosis but of treatment. To improve competitiveness and overall product, Spanish football might try to share TV revenue more evenly between clubs, helping make the chase for the title actually interesting; authorities could announce kick-off times more than 10 minutes before games, allowing more people to attend; take serious action against racism and sexism; stop clubs, the richest ones included, from living beyond their means; shrink the country so that away fans can travel and create atmosphere.
Instead, though, Villarreal and Barcelona are being sent to the USA USA USA where, presumably, fans will show just how much they love and care for the game by putting its needs above their own and boycotting such an egregious and competitive disgrace. Football is capable of many wondrous things, but what it cannot do is change the history and geography of the planet and, though it is possible for people from elsewhere to understand the vibe, history and tradition of eastern Spain’s Castellón region – all power to them – clubs have names, names which represent a place. To take an example entirely at random, Villarreal are called Villarreal because they come from Villarreal, play in Villarreal and represent Villarreal; to significant extent, they are Villarreal. That’s how it effin’ well works. So, though it’s brilliant to see this thing of ours traverse the world, mankind’s only creation able to cross every border, without that locus, no quantity of pounds, euros or dollars can make it worth anything, or mean anything. It is not just about what is integrity, but what is integral.

Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink now being reduced to doing Strictly Come Dancing is quite depressing but seeing a big picture of him smiling is even more unsettling (he should always be stood by the corner flag grimacing after smacking a goal into the top corner against Arsenal). However, the pièce de résistance, is the quote attributed to him: ‘I’m looking forward to tackling a fun challenge! Bring on a new type of footwork, with hopefully no own goals’, which was clearly written by a PR intern who has no idea who Jimmy is and appears to have never even seen an actual game of football” – Noble Francis.
