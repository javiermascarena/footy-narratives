Gyokeres has lift-off at Arsenal as Man City toil - hits and misses,,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13416627/man-city-produce-a-worrying-display-in-defeat-to-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-hits-and-misses,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 12:08:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester City']","
Following a difficult debut against Manchester United, Viktor Gyokeres endured more of the same in the first half of Arsenal's meeting with Leeds. There were heavy touches, a snatched shot inside the box and a general over-eagerness to impress.
But it only took three minutes of the second half for everything to change. Finally given a chance to run in behind by Riccardo Calafiori's ball over the top, the striker showcased his power and cutting edge, driving inside and sending a low finish past the goalkeeper.
""It's clear that Viktor is really dangerous,"" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta in his press conference afterwards. ""That's his superpower. Let's put him as much as possible in those kind of scenarios, because something will happen.""
Kai Havertz's injury has added to the onus on Gyokeres' shoulders but this was exactly the response Arsenal needed. Clearly, there is still work to do to provide him with the level of service he requires. As at Old Trafford, his touch count was low against Leeds.
But his first goal altered the trajectory of his performance and Arteta will hope it serves as the lift-off he needs. The impact on his confidence could certainly be seen in the manner in which he dispatched the late penalty won by the brilliant Max Dowman.
He will need that same confidence at Anfield next weekend. But following a short pre-season, he is sharpening up physically too. ""It was important for me to get 90 minutes, get the rhythm and to get to know the team even more,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I felt more comfortable in how we're playing. I think you can see that as well.""Nick Wright
Manchester City fans will have left the Etihad on Saturday with more questions than answers after a performance that was the complete antithesis of last weekend's win over Wolves. Creative, fluid patterns were replaced by unimaginative, misplaced passes.
James Trafford's mistake will hit hardest because it led to a goal but he was far from the worst offender. City were sloppy, undone by a team who looked more confident and assured in their specific roles.
Cristian Romero did a number on Erling Haaland. Joao Palhinha, who won more duels than any other player, and Rodrigo Bentancur were more assertive than Tijjani Reijnders and Nico Gonzalez in midfield. Mohammed Kudus more direct in attack.
Defensively they were excellent, too, drawing particular acclaim from Thomas Frank for a 'top mentality'. No signs of Spursy Spurs here.
As for Man City, this is a confusing start. Are they back in contention as title candidates or was matchday one just a ruse? Pep Guardiola insisted his side would ""make the click"" - but offered no assurances as to when that might happen.
Until then, we will be left to ponder what this Man City side, complete with its extravagant summer remodel, are truly capable of.Laura Hunter
Some players might be different but the ethos and tactics remain the same for Bournemouth. That is why perhaps the best bit of business the Cherries did this summer was to keep hold of Andoni Iraola. This was very much business as usual for them.
Wolves were swept away at times by the brave Bournemouth press and aggression without the ball. That was on show for the only goal of the game where Tyler Adams robbed Jean‐Ricner Bellegarde in a typical Iraola pressing trap that the visitors fell into. It ended up the game-winning moment. It's this style of football that has played a huge part in the captures of Ben Gannon-Doak and Amine Adli, who offered the home fans a glimpse of his talents in an impressive cameo. With Iraola at the helm, another season of excitement awaits.Lewis Jones
There was, understandably, some doom and gloom around the Gtech after Brentford saw Bryan Mbeumo leave for Man Utd this summer and then Yoane Wissa also ask to join Newcastle United, a double blow compounded by a limp opening-day loss at Nottingham Forest - but Dango Ouattara's impressive debut in the win against Aston Villa has given the Bees and new head coach Keith Andrews a real spring in their step.
It did cost the west London club £42m to replace Mbeumo with the Bournemouth forward, but that looks money well spent on the basis of his match-winning display that saw off Villa on Saturday afternoon to give Andrews his first win as the new Bees boss.
It was not just the confident manner in which the 23-year-old took his goal after being played clean through by Igor Thiago's clever flick that caught his boss' eye.
But also the way the Burkina Faso international spent much of the rest of the game tracking back, man-marking Lucas Digne and going on to win more duels than any of his team-mates, before rightly receiving a standing ovation when he was substituted late on.
""His goal will get the headlines but for me, it was the aspects of the game, the selfless nature of how he approached the game, and knew what was needed to get a result,"" Andrews said after the game.
""If he didn't stick to that it would've been very difficult to deal with them. He was amazing in the space of a few days [since joining]. I know he'll be a big player for this club, his attributes are there for everyone to see.
""You'll see that more as we get more control of games and feed him a bit more, but the out of possession shift he put in was selfless. I'm not too surprised, right from the first moment I spoke to him I was really impressed with him.""Rich Morgan
The third statistic should worry Aston Villa more than the second because results will not follow until Unai Emery's side can look more dangerous.
For a second weekend in a row they were ineffective in front of goal and despite improving after a below-par first 45 at Brentford, managed just a solitary shot on target from their second-half showing.
Emery pointed out after the game that the backs-to-the-wall shift the Bees put in was reminiscent of each of his side's visits to the Gtech since he took over.
But this victory for the hosts ended a six-game unbeaten streak for the Villans. Yes, these are normally tight affairs, but Villa normally have the guile to edge things.
It is easy to point to the loss of attacking players since the end of last season but this was still a line-up including Morgan Rogers and Youri Tielemans, with one of the Premier League's most willing runners - and deadliest finishers - in attack.
On the odd occasion, patterns of play worked well and they looked dangerous. But something is not clicking, and it's not just a lack of new faces.Ron Walker
It took until October for all three promoted sides to win a game in the Premier League last season. This season, it has only taken two weeks.
Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds United have already won half as many home games as last Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton last season, too.
It is early days for the newly-promoted trio but all three teams are showing the bravery, determination and quality to secure points in the top-flight.
Whether or not they can maintain this momentum throughout the course of the entire season remains to be seen. However, the early signs are promising.
All three promoted teams dropped back into the Championship last season - that might not be the case this time round. Patrick Rowe
It's mid-August and West Ham look like they're heading for a relegation fight. Just two games into the season, alarm bells are ringing and fans made their frustrations felt during the dismal thrashing by Chelsea.
On the pitch, there are goalkeeper questions, defensive lapses, a midfield lacking power and a toothless attack.
Off it, head coach Graham Potter - who has the second-worst record of West Ham managers in the Premier League - is under pressure but can also point to an underwhelming window of transfer business.
The 3-0 loss at promoted Sunderland was a terrible start but the 5-1 dismantling by Chelsea will leave their followers wondering where they go next. It needs to be to the transfer market, if they are to significantly shift the way this season is going.Peter Smith

"Arsenal injury woes deepen as Saka, Odegaard off against Leeds",Arsenal's injury concerns deepened further on <em>Saturday Night Football </em>as Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard were taken off against Leeds.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13417223/arsenal-injuries-bukayo-saka-and-martin-odegaard-taken-off-against-leeds-with-liverpool-showdown-next-weekend,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 19:05:00",,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal's injury concerns deepened further on Saturday Night Football as Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard were taken off against Leeds.
Gunners captain Odegaard went down under a challenge in the first half and suffered a shoulder injury, coming off having initially played on.
Arsenal's woes worsened in the second half when Saka - who had scored Arsenal's second goal on the stroke of half-time - went down with an issue in his left hamstring.
The England international missed four months of last season with a serious hamstring injury, and was replaced by Leandro Trossard in the 53rd minute.
""Martin felt something in his shoulder when he landed,"" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, who added the captain would have a scan on Sunday.
""Bukayo, carrying the ball, felt something in his hamstring. I think it's the other one, not the same as the previous injury.
""He felt something sprinting, that's never a good sign. We have to speak to the doctors [on Sunday]. Let's wait.""
Reacting to Saka's injury, Gary Neville said on co-commentary on Sky Sports: ""You can read his lips. He said: 'Oh my God'. This is something he doesn't like. He's a tough kid. He doesn't go down injured easily, if ever.""
And Sky Sports' Nick Wright added: ""Saka looks worried as he goes off. So do the Arsenal fans around us. There are a few words in the ear of Arteta and his assistant, then it's down the tunnel, shaking his head as he goes.""
Once again, the injury issues for Arsenal are piling up ahead of an early season showdown with Liverpool next weekend, live on Super Sunday.
Kai Havertz had already been ruled out ahead of the game against Leeds, although the extent of his injury has not yet been revealed.
""In two weeks, already we lost Kai [Havertz], Bukayo, Martin,"" said Arteta. ""It shows how well equipped you have to be in this league.""
Summer signing Christian Norgaard is also yet to make his debut as he continues to recover from an injury, while Ben White did not pass a late fitness test for Saturday's game.
Jurrien Timber's minutes are continuing to be managed - although he scored twice and assisted against Leeds - while Gabriel Jesus continues his recovery from an ACL injury.
The injury concerns come after a jubilant pre-match introduction of Eberechi Eze, who was introduced to the home crowd wearing the No 10 shirt after signing from Crystal Palace on Saturday.
Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp:
""They need Eze. He may start at Anfield. I would like to see him play centrally. It could be difficult for him to play wide. Right now the player under a little bit of pressure is Martin Odegaard. He'll be looking at Eze thinking he could be a problem for me. If you asked Eze, he'd want to play centrally.
""There are lots of players that can come in but there's only one Bukayo Saka. When he had surgery on his other hamstring, it deflated the whole team - they weren't the same and lost a goal threat.
""He was their talisman. Saka is the one that when he gets the ball everything will be alright. To not have him at Anfield will be a major blow.""
Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta on new signing Eberechi Eze:
""The talent is unquestionable. He's done it in this league. The personality, unbelievable.
""He has the capacity to create these magic moments. He can do it from different positions, different situations.
""He's got that flair. He's got that charisma as well about him that is very contagious.""

PL predictions: Fulham to inflict another defeat on Man Utd,Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Fulham will inflict another defeat on Man Utd on Sunday.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415691/premier-league-predictions-and-best-bets-including-a-9-1-jones-knows-weekend-treble,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 09:31:00",Lewis Jones,['Manchester United'],"Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Fulham will inflict another defeat on Man Utd on Sunday.
My first port of call whenever a key player leaves or suffers a serious injury is the with and without data to try and quantify how much a team will miss that player's output. Well, since the start of the 23/24 season, Eberechi Eze - on his way to Arsenal - hasn't started 21 games in the Premier League and in that time Palace's win percentage goes from 40 per cent to 19 per cent and their points per game drops from 1.5 to just 1.0 per game.
Oliver Glasner has a difficult job in keeping confidence and mentality levels high within his squad after losing such an important and well-liked player.
Forest are a trustworthy team as you know exactly what you're going to get in that they're very good in both boxes, and are led impeccably by Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo in defence - one of the best defensive pairings in Europe.
This looks a great time to head to Selhurst Park and the away win at 21/10 with Sky Bet does appeal.
One lazy narrative that has stuck out during the pre-season chat is how Everton could struggle without the fortress of Goodison Park and may suffer from new stadium nerves. However, the last five teams in the top two tiers of English football that have moved stadiums possess a healthy record across their first five games.
From those 25 games, they won 16 of them, losing just four.
Hill Dickinson Stadium has been strategically built to keep the atmosphere hot and hostile and when Everton fans turn up the noise, they remain one of the most passionate set of fans in the country. Brighton are a team overrated by the markets in my view and the 19/10 with Sky Bet on Everton starting with a win at their new home looks a solid wager.
The market likes what it saw from Manchester United against Arsenal based on their win price here. They are 21/20 with Sky Bet although it doesn't feel like particularly smart money is driving the United price into what it is. They still looked very timid in central midfield without the ball and doubts remain about whether the wing-backs - a key cog in any 3-5-2 system - provide enough attacking output to turn United into a functional and exciting team.
I like backing Fulham when they are overlooked. Marco Silva's men are mostly ignored by the market but they took 30 of their 54 points last season against top-half teams. That's a huge return and one that made them very profitable to back as outsiders when the price was right. You can get 6/4 with Sky Bet here on Fulham on the draw no bet market meaning stakes are refunded if the game ends level.
Eddie Howe is doing a great job at using the Alexander Isak situation to bring the club together as best he can.
When St James' Park smells disrespect, it bites back. You can expect the atmosphere to be a bearpit on Monday. Every Liverpool touch booed. Newcastle players pumped to play aggressively from the first whistle as they look to utilise that hotbed of noise to their advantage.
And that's when the Toon are at their most dangerous.
Despite the win vs Bournemouth, Liverpool appeared more vulnerable on the break than last season as they faced more fast breaks (5) in that game than in any Premier League game at Anfield last season.
And Newcastle are built to counter-attack with a front three of Anthony Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes perfectly equipped to hit Liverpool in transition. The hosts look a great bet in the double chance market at 4/5 with Sky Bet.

"Amorim: Everything feels different this season, I'm excited","With Manchester United, there is hardly ever a middle ground but instead an ever expanding extremes of a scale",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13416578/ruben-amorim-manchester-united-will-be-different-this-season-and-im-excited,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 10:00:00",Danyal Khan,['Manchester United'],"With Manchester United, there is hardly ever a middle ground but instead an ever expanding extremes of a scale
Let me explain.
Last season, United had a clear problem with their goalscoring and build-up play - that was simply highlighted by their 44 goals scored in the Premier League, only three teams scored fewer.
So what did United do in this window? They spent around £200m on addressing that problem with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.
After a positive first performance of the season in their defeat to Arsenal - much of the conversation has now been centred around the opposite end of the pitch with the goalkeeping department the latest area to be under focus after what seemed to be a mistake by Altay Bayindir against Mikel Arteta's side.
Ruben Amorim admitted in his first news conference of the season that he learned a lot last season. This included realising just how much he needs to protect his side from the amount of noise around the club on a weekly basis.
When I sat down with the United boss ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham, live on Sky Sports, it was an easy question - how did you go about protecting the under-fire goalkeeping department this week?
""The first thing I've already said to my players is when you see so many critics, you get upset and that is normal,"" Amorim explained to Sky Sports News.
""For me, the only way to protect myself and my players it to tell them not to see anything.
""You have to be like a monk, especially when you have problems and then I try to present the facts because sometimes there is a narrative that is not true.
""Altay made one mistake, but last year he had very good performances, so I try to tell that to the players and then try to battle that narrative.
""But in the end, it's with the players, they have to enjoy their life, go to work, enjoy their family and try not to see anything on the TV or on the internet.""
Many of the players have highlighted that they feel the vibe and bond around the team has been different.
Yes, there is some hesitancy to believe that after previous managers and false dawns, but there does seem to be genuine optimism after the re-opening of their training ground, new and exciting players joining the club and a positive first performance against Arsenal.
Amorim said: ""Last year, sometimes I was worried going to the games, but now I'm excited, it is completely different.""
""We suffered together so much (last season) and that can bond people - the spirit is really good.""
""When you feel the team is playing well, you get confident and you feel more free to play and if you feel more free to play, you are happier.
""If you are happier, your day-to-day is better and it's like a snowball.""
Amorim's attacking options have been bolstered with Premier League tried and tested Mbeumo and Cunha - both who can play as No 10s or as the main striker to share the load alongside the young Sesko.
The threat they showed against Arsenal, whether it was Cunha's mazy runs or Mbeumo's movements in behind, left fans at Old Trafford with a renewed sense of optimism and Amorim feels the same.
""We have different options this year, but sometimes football is more than just on the pitch,"" Amorim said.
""They [Mbeumo and Cunha] are coming in at a moment where the spirit is different, the place is different - sometimes we have a lot of very good players but the scars were there and that influenced the dynamic of the team.
""They can help us, not just on the pitch but off the pitch too, I feel the guys are more free because they were not here in the very, very difficult moments - they are seeing a different thing.""
A big component of whether Amorim's United will truly be a ""different thing"" this season could be the young Slovenian Sesko - who Amorim had called 'football obsessed'.
He had already spoken about the potential of Sesko, 22, but I wondered - how exciting can it be for Amorim himself to work and develop a young player like the Slovenian?
Amorim explained: ""When you are in a club like this, you want to have the best players but you also have to imagine the future.
""That is so exciting - I like to know the players, I like to see the videos of the players and to try to get all the information, but you want that confirmation and I felt Sesko was even better than what I was thinking.
""I have to be careful, Sesko is going to be our striker for many, many years so we need to put that in his head and let him settle down, to stay calm and enjoy his day because he's really like you said, obsessed.
""I'm really happy - not just with him but with Cunha, Diego (Leon), and Mbeumo - we know that we have the players and we know that in our future we are going to have that base and that is really important for us.""
We are only one game into the season, but if United can replicate their performance against Arsenal most weeks, especially without the distraction of European football, it could present a promising opportunity for United to improve on last season's 15th-place finish.
However, United need to earn that optimism from those outside the gates of Carrington and, as Amorim said previously, it is only up to them to fight and change their own narrative.
They will only do that by showing up on the journey rather than focusing on the destination.
""Success is to win titles, and we don't know if we are going to achieve that (this season),"" Amorim said.
""We are not in the moment that we can say we are clearly fighting for the league - we just need to get the small steps and the small steps is to prepare every game like it's a final.
""We want to be really competitive, trying to dominate games, trying to score goals and not get our fans bored to see our games… so if we have the small things and we put check, check, check - in the end, it's going to be better.
""I think everyone knows that we have a goal - not for this season but in three years to win the Premier League title.
""We are going to do these steps to reach that goal, but in this club, you know that every week the narrative is going to be different so we need to be prepared for that, block the noise, do the job and try to win games.""

Has Frank managed to stamp the Spursy out of Spurs already?,"For the second straight year Tottenham triumphed at the Etihad, beating Manchester City 2-0 with a composed and clinical performance to end City's 10-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13417196/tottenhams-perfect-premier-league-start-continues-and-they-have-thomas-frank-to-thank,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 18:21:00",,"['Manchester City', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","For the second straight year Tottenham triumphed at the Etihad, beating Manchester City 2-0 with a composed and clinical performance to end City's 10-game unbeaten streak in the Premier League.
Spurs are only the second side to win away to a Pep Guardiola-managed team in back-to-back seasons. And this one was far too easily achieved.
City fans will have left the Etihad on Saturday with more questions than answers after a performance that was the complete antithesis of last weekend's win over Wolves.
Creative, fluid patterns that led to goal-scoring opportunities were replaced by unimaginative, misplaced passes, that resulted in very little positive. City underwhelmed for the majority, but you have to wonder how much of that underperformance was down to Spurs' organised and aggressive gameplan.
From the first time James Trafford was offered the ball in open play, it was evident that Thomas Frank had directed his players to rush the City box. Richarlison nearly nicked the ball off his toe in the ninth minute of the game. They swarmed in packs and never let City settle, eventually forcing the mistake for Joao Palhinha to score a well-timed second goal. City had no response.
The visitors were content conceding possession, but hit City where it hurt, with more efforts at goal and a greater number of shots on target. Each of the two big chances they created ended in a goal. The two Man City generated ended in a miss.
City were being confronted by a team who looked more confident and assured in their specific roles, like they had played this way for years. Like it came naturally.
Cristian Romero did a number on Erling Haaland. Palhinha, who won more duels than any other player, and Rodrigo Bentancur were more assertive than Tijjani Reijnders and Nico Gonzalez in midfield. Mohammed Kudus more direct in attack.
""I have a feeling the performance was a little bit better than the result,"" reflected Guardiola, generously. His reading of the game will be incompatible with most others.
Saturday's result was not only a statement victory for the Frank regime, but a triumph of managerial style.
Having also won with Brentford in November 2022, Frank becomes only the third manager to beat Guardiola away from home with two different clubs. There's no coincidence in that. ""I definitely believe in the aggressive press, as you saw today, and as you saw with my Brentford team.
""I believe in being front-footed. I like that mentality, it's a more offensive way of defending. It's more fun to defend on the opponents' half. So, yeah, let's go for it.""
Spurs may have started the campaign under the highly Spursy contradiction of having endured their worst domestic season for nearly 50 years, while simultaneously landing a first trophy since 2008, but Frank is out to change perceptions for good.
""We have been working so hard on our defensive principles. Mentality is the key thing - you need mentality to win games like this,"" he added post-match.
Tottenham have long been mocked for an absence of big-game mindset. The term Spursy is rooted in that all-too-familiar shortcoming, evident just three weeks ago in Super Cup defeat to PSG after blowing a 2-0 lead.
But they have passed the real acid test with flying colours in these opening two weeks, with Frank's fingerprint also all over the 3-0 downing of Burnley.
Even failed pursuits to sign a No 10 - losing out on Eberechi Eze to Arsenal just this week - have not derailed focus. Spurs' creative side has shone, scoring five times, while registering two clean sheets.
Six points and a goal difference of +5 represents their best start to a league season. A small sample size, yes, but a big change in identity and fortitude. The question now will be: how long can it last?

Eze joins Arsenal from Crystal Palace,Eberechi Eze has signed for Arsenal in a &#163;67.5m deal from Crystal Palace after his move to Tottenham Hotspur was hijacked by their north London rivals.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13416014/eberechi-eze-joins-arsenal-forward-signs-from-crystal-palace-in-67-5m-deal-after-tottenham-hotspur-move-hijacked,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:00:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Eberechi Eze has signed for Arsenal in a £67.5m deal from Crystal Palace after his move to Tottenham Hotspur was hijacked by their north London rivals.
The Gunners, who revealed the signing ahead of Saturday's game against Leeds, will pay a guaranteed fee of £60m plus £7.5m in add-ons for the forward, taking their summer transfer spend to £267m.
Eze has signed a four-year deal with Arsenal, with the option of a further year, and will wear the No 10 shirt - previously worn by the likes of Dennis Bergkamp, Mesut Ozil and Robin van Persie - as well as academy players Jack Wilshere and Emile Smith Rowe.
Spurs felt they had an agreement in place with Palace and Eze on Wednesday before their north London rivals reignited their interest and swooped in following an injury to Kai Havertz - though it is understood the German's injury is a contributing factor - not the primary reason - for signing Eze.
Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta described the dramatic deal on Wednesday as ""one of the fastest and one of the most probably unexpected"".
He also praised the decisiveness with which the Arsenal hierarchy moved. ""It showed an incredible determination. Starting from the ownership, starting from Josh [Kroenke] and then all the board to recognise that we had to act.
""It was our choice, obviously. That shows the level of determination and how much we want to take this club to a different level.""
Eze was one of a number of players Arsenal looked into in the first few weeks of the window, where, significantly, a lot of the work was carried out in June when they explored the conditions of a deal. The Gunners consider Eze as an option on the left, in the middle of the pitch - but also on the right.
Spurs were considering offering Richarlison in a deal for Eze. That would have freed up striker space for them to try and sign Yoane Wissa, who played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Wissa still wants to join Newcastle, who had a second bid rejected on Wednesday.
Mikel Arteta explained how one Eberechi Eze phone call to him stopped the midfielder moving from Tottenham - and got him a move to Arsenal instead.
The Gunners completed the £67.5m move to the club when it looked for so long that he would end up at Spurs.
It was reported by The Athletic that on Wednesday, when Arsenal's deal accelerated, Eze was set for Spurs - but then called Arteta to double check if Arsenal were definitely not an option for him.
The Arsenal manager then reportedly summoned a board meeting, which convinced the club hierarchy to sign Eze.
""That shows you how much he wanted to come,"" said Arteta to BEIN Sports after the Leeds game when asked about that phone call.
""It's very difficult sometimes because you want to be very open and transparent with the players, and they have to make decisions about their careers. It was very, very important. I'm delighted to have him. You can tell how much it means to him and his whole family.
""Welcome to our family and I'm sure we're going to have some great moments together.""
Asked about what Eze brings to Arsenal, Arteta said: ""The talent is unquestionable. He's done it in this league. The personality, unbelievable.
""He has the capacity to create these magic moments. He can do it from different positions, different situations.
""He's got that flair. He's got that charisma as well about him that is very contagious.""
Arsenal have held a long-standing interest in Eze, who was previously on the books of their academy and has said he was a supporter of the club growing up. It us understood Arsenal were very evident Eze wanted to join the club from their first conversation with him.
They explored a potential deal earlier in the window, but chose not to pursue a deal at that stage as they prioritised strengthening other areas of the squad and agreeing new contracts with existing players.
Spurs then came in for Eze after Morgan Gibbs-White chose to sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest and they lost James Maddison to an ACL injury.
Talks were held between Tottenham and Palace, and Spurs felt they had an agreement in place on Wednesday with the club and the player.
However, Arsenal then came in to hijack the deal in a major twist on Wednesday evening. The Gunners consider Eze as an option on the left, in the middle of the pitch - but also on the right.
The Eze deal also means Premier League clubs have now broken the record for the most spent on transfers in a single window.
The previous record was the summer of 2023 with the record at £2.4634bn.
However, the £67.5m Eze deal means all 20 Premier League clubs have now spent £2,511,693,000 between them in this window.
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
Eberechi Eze is electric. The 27-year-old is a delight to watch with his poise and swagger on the ball and craft to open up defences, not to mention his penchant for scoring spectacular strikes himself.
He finished last season as one of the hottest prospects in the country, scoring in six games in a row, including both the FA Cup semi-final and final at Wembley as he helped inspire Crystal Palace to their first major honour.
Last season wasn't all plain sailing, though. ""I think Ebere has had a strange season,"" said Palace boss Oliver Glasner at the end of March. ""He hasn't had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going. He's also struggled with strange injuries.""
Those comments came after Eze had ignited Palace in an FA Cup tie at Fulham, scoring one and setting up another. That standout display came on the back of a first goal for England. Fit and full of confidence, Eze was back to his best during the run-in.
It is that livewire maverick Arsenal will hope can unlock deep defences and bring a spark to their previously at-times predictable patterns of attack. He offers something completely different to Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli, the current wide left options and Viktor Gyokeres will be relishing the prospect of latching onto the type of passes which have proved so productive for Jean-Philippe Mateta.
After being released by the Gunners as a 13-year-old, Eze will be motivated to seize a second chance in north London - and, in his prime, he looks set to do just that and make a big impact for Arteta.

"Skill, confidence & laughs - schoolboy Dowman takes to Premier League",Max Dowman becomes Arsenal's second-youngest player and wins a penalty on his Premier League debut against Leeds aged 15 years and 234 days.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crm4p9xkwlko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 20:51:17",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Max Dowman stood laughing as Declan Rice bounced the ball off his backside during an open training session on Arsenal's pre-season tour of Hong Kong in the summer.
The 15-year-old then tried to mimic the fun piece of skill before manager Mikel Arteta punched the ball away to stop Dowman completing the movement during a light-hearted moment.
It was a reminder that behind the enormous talent he has shown during his outings for the Arsenal first team in pre-season - and now on his Premier League debut - that Dowman was a year 10 student until last month.
That training session took place just a day before he replaced Gunners talisman Bukayo Saka against Tottenham Hotspur in the Kai Tak Stadium. The teenager came on and looked like Arsenal's brightest attacking spark.
Dowman's introductions as a substitute were some of the highlights of Arsenal's pre-season, dazzling with his runs down the right-hand side and winning two penalties against Newcastle United and Villarreal.
At 15 years and 234 days old, he has now become the second-youngest player to play for the club, only behind his team-mate Ethan Nwaneri, who made his debut at 15 years 181 days in September 2022 against Brentford.
The winger came off the bench in the 64th minute and excited the home crowd with a weaving run that was only ended when he was brought down by Leeds left-back Gabriel Gudmundsson, who was booked.
Then in added time, Dowman again showed quick feet before being dropped by Anton Stach in the penalty area, with Viktor Gyokeres slamming home the spot-kick to complete a 5-0 rout.
'Dowman can deliver things I've never seen in my life'
""This is what we see every single day in training,"" Arsenal boss Arteta said when asked by BBC Sport about the Dowman's impact.
""We gathered the information about how he handles certain situations, in terms of training, being in the squad and not being selected afterwards in Manchester [against United], coming on the bench and feeling ready.
""Again, big compliments to his family. I think they raised a kid with a level of maturity, stability and hunger that is very difficult to see.
""And to the academy - Per [Mertesacker] and all the coaches and everybody that has been involved in that journey.
""Because there is a kid here that has zero hesitation and is so convinced that at 15 he can go and deliver, which I have never witnessed in my life.
""For us he brings joy, he brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great.""
The talent of Dowman is no shock to anyone who has been around Arsenal. He has been training with the first-team squad since he was 14.
He was taken on the team's warm weather training camp to Dubai in January and there were calls from supporters for him to be used during the last campaign when Arteta's squad was decimated by injuries.
Dowman played for England at the European Under-17 Championship in May, and became the competition's youngest scorer when he netted in a win over the Czech Republic.
He featured three years above his age group when playing for the Under-18s at Arsenal. Last season he scored 19 goals and provided five assists in 23 games, with 17 of those goal involvements coming in the last seven matches of the Under-18 Premier League South season (14 goals, three assists).
Age restrictions stopped him from making his Premier League debut last season but now he is eligible and with a potential hamstring injury to Saka, the young winger could be about to be thrust into the spotlight more often.
Dowman replaced Saka in four of the pre-season matches before being given time off to rest against Athletic Bilbao, but the winger looks full of energy in what could be his breakthrough season.
Arteta also said that he needs to ""protect"" Dowman on his journey but that has not stopped his team-mates heaping praise on him.
""I think everyone can see the potential he has. Playing against grown men. He is a joy to watch, for the crowd too he is a joy to watch. Hopefully, he will have many amazing years here."" Jurrien Timber said after the match.
And with injuries for Arsenal trio Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and Saka, there may be more Premier League opportunities heading Dowman's way.

Why Frank could be Spurs' best signing of the summer,"Two games, two wins, two clean sheets. Tottenham's Thomas Frank is off to a fine start as manager.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czer22pn87yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:34:46",Sean Kearns,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Thomas Frank said he was ""falling in love"" with Tottenham after the side's 2-0 win at Manchester City - and the feeling is mutual with supporters.
The Dane could not have made a much better start to life in the Premier League with his new side.
Saturday's result means it is consecutive wins and successive clean sheets, with some eye-catching attacking football along the way.
Frank, named as Ange Postecoglou's replacement after the Australian coach guided Spurs to the Europa League trophy last May, has already begun to win over hearts and minds in north London.
His impressive start has come against the backdrop of widespread supporter discontent at the club's perceived failings in this summer's transfer window and disillusionment with chairman Daniel Levy.
But bringing in Frank from Brentford may be the club's best signing of all.
A summer of discontent
The mood at Spurs has been peculiar this summer.
After the high of winning the Europa League at the end of last season, supporters were desperate for the side to kick on after a 17th place finish in the Premier League.
But Mohammed Kudus, a £50m signing from West Ham, and Joao Palhinha, a season-long loan signing from Bayern Munich, have been the only additions to the first-team squad since Postecoglou's departure.
On the club's pre-season tour, captain Son Heung-min said farewell to the club, while James Maddison suffered a knee injury that has ruled him out of the majority of the season.
Supporters have then had to deal with the ignominy of the collapse of two deals for high-profile transfer targets.
The club activated a £60m release clause in Morgan Gibbs-White's contract at Nottingham Forest, only for the England midfielder to sign a new deal with the club less than a week later.
Spurs then thought they had tied up a deal for England winger Eberechi Eze, only for the Crystal Palace playmaker to choose rivals Arsenal at the 11th hour.
""What is 100% sure is that we brought two top players into the club - Kudus and Palhinha - and both of them have performed very well,"" said Frank.
""And Palhinha, wow. You know, sometimes players need confidence, and they need to be on top.""
Club chairman Levy has been criticised following the collapse of the Eze deal and for the club's transfer failings this summer.
There seemed to be added venom to the chants of ""Levy out"" from the 3,000-strong away following at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
But it was Levy's decision to part with Postecoglou and to hire Frank.
'Attacking freedom but big on details'
Despite finishing 17th last season, Spurs scored 64 times in the Premier League - only five fewer than second-placed Arsenal managed.
There was no doubting that the side played some swashbuckling football under Postecoglou, but they conceded 65 times last term, to finish with a negative goal difference of one.
Though Frank has only taken charge for two Premier League matches, Spurs have been solid in both with the side keeping clean sheets in both.
Asked about the difference between the two managers, 2023 signing Brennan Johnson said: ""They are two different coaches. I'm really enjoying it. A lot of detail goes into the set-pieces, but at the same time he (Frank) gives us a lot of attacking freedom.
""We have kept two clean sheets and against Manchester City it is not easy. I have played here a lot of times and conceded a lot of goals.""
'Frank's masterstroke'
One of the main criticisms of Postecoglou was his refusal to adapt to the opposition.
When Spurs were winning games, the Aussie's approach of ""it's just who we are, mate"" went down well with supporters.
It wore thin when the likes of Ipswich and Leicester were leaving north London with three points.
But Postecoglou's biggest weakness is arguably Frank's biggest strength.
In the Super Cup defeat by Paris Saint-Germain earlier this month, Spurs came within 60 seconds of beating Luis Enrique's side.
Frank opted for a 3-5-2 formation, utilising Richarlison and Kudus in attack with an extra centre-back to nullify the threat of false nine Ousmane Dembele and suffocating the space for wingers Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.
In Spurs' Premier League opener against Burnley - when they were favourites to win and would be expected to have the majority of possession - Frank switched to a 4-3-3 formation and selected a midfield of Lucas Bergvall, Archie Gray and Pape Matar Sarr.
Frank stuck with the same formation against Manchester City on Saturday but brought Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur - two defensively-minded midfielders - back into his starting line-up.
""The way the head coach has been able to adapt so early in his tenure – sometimes using a back four and sometimes a five - even bringing in in Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur, that was a masterstroke,"" said Match of the Day pundit Micah Richards.
""Thomas Frank's brought a knowhow of how to see games out.""
Palhinha's role
After a successful two years with Fulham, Palhinha joined Bayern Munich for around £44m in 2024.
But within 12 months the 30-year-old found himself back in England after failing to win over manager Vincent Kompany at the Allianz Arena.
While there's no doubting his off-the-ball work, Palhinha's struggles at Bayern  raised questions over his suitability to playing possession football
But the midfielder has impressed at Spurs and was named player of the match at Etihad Stadium after winning more duels (eight) and making more tackles (four) than any other player on the pitch.
""The coach (Frank) pushed me to come here and showed me the project,"" Palhinha told TNT Sports.
""It is such a great club, and I am really glad to be in the Premier League again.
""I am so happy, me and my family. Now I want to enjoy this top club and top atmosphere again.""

'Is Trafford really top drawer?' - Guardiola's keeper conundrum,James Trafford's performance in the home loss against Tottenham has given Pep Guardiola a decision to make on his number one goalkeeper.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czr62er2035o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 15:24:30",Shamoon Hafez,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"""It's happened again, it's happened again, Manchester City, it's happened again.""
That was the chant bellowed from the Etihad Stadium's away end at full-time after City were again humbled at home by Tottenham Hotspur.
Spurs were scintillating on their visit here last November and inflicted a 4-0 thrashing, but they were given a helping hand on this occasion and it was one they gleefully accepted.
This time it was 2-0. The visiting Spurs contingent, who have suffered as targets of the ""it's happened again"" jibe in the past, made sure to enjoy the moment.
Deploying a high defensive line cost Pep Guardiola's City side the opening goal, while goalkeeper James Trafford did not cover himself in glory for the second in an overall jittery performance on his home debut.
Ederson has been City's undisputed number one for eight years, but the Brazilian watched on from the bench after missing the Wolves game through illness last weekend amid heavy links with a move to Turkish giants Galatasaray.
What is clear is that Guardiola has a big long-term decision to make about the goalkeeper role.
""James made a good first game and I decided to continue [with him],"" said Guardiola, explaining Trafford's selection.
""The keeper is a special position, of course, to have more consistency in the goal.
""When I take decisions in the first part of the season for all the players who play one or two games, everyone thinks 'OK this is the starting line-up, these are the players who are going to play', but with these amount of games, everyone will play.
""It was just today I decided that.""
Trafford 'poor' for second goal
Trafford was in celebratory mood earlier in the week when he collected the PFA's Championship player of the year award at the Opera House in Manchester city centre, reward for his performances in the second tier for Burnley.
The 22-year-old kept 29 clean sheets in the league last season for the Clarets, and after joining City he was quickly on song, as Guardiola pointed out, in the opening win at Wolves.
But this was a different story, a difficult first showing in a City shirt at Etihad Stadium.
Trafford came through the City ranks and rejoined the club for £27m from Burnley this summer having not made a senior appearance in his first spell.
He will have been dreaming of playing Premier League football for City at the Etihad, but it turned into an uncomfortable afternoon, Trafford slipping away from centre stage at the final whistle with songs from joyful Spurs fans ringing in his ears.
Guardiola has turned to youth in his rebuild.
Saturday's team, with an average age of 24 years and 326 days, was the youngest starting XI named by the Spaniard in the Premier League and they have plenty to learn.
Tottenham's Richarlison pressed relentlessly all game and forced Trafford into conceding a corner, while the keeper was lucky not to be dismissed for a collision on the edge of the box with Spurs winger Mohammed Kudus.
And at 1-0 behind, with the crowd beginning to get anxious, those shaky moments then turned into a calamity as Trafford played a loose pass inside the area to Ruben Dias, who failed to control, and Joao Palhinha eventually smashed in.
City failed to recover, slipping to defeat in their first home game of the campaign.
""City were well beaten today,"" former Premier League striker Chris Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I've got to say I'm not sure about the goalkeeper situation.
""Is James Trafford really top drawer? If it's a choice between Trafford and Ederson, I'm going with Ederson.
""It was poor for the goal, a weak pass into Dias, not even passing on to the right side, and that absolutely killed them with Spurs going in 2-0 at half-time.""
Goalkeeping decision to make for Guardiola
Paris St-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma is rumoured to be of interest to City and sources have not totally ruled out a move for the Italian, but it would need Ederson to move on.
Guardiola, though, now has a decision to make as to whether he sticks with Trafford, brings Ederson back into the fold, or sells the Brazilian and signs Donnarumma.
The manager seems unsure himself, having said before the start of the season that Ederson was his number one, but then on Friday saying he will pick ""who trains good"".
Trafford was given the nod, but the decision raises more questions than answers.
Similar to counterpart Ruben Amorim across the city, the managers of both Manchester clubs each have a goalkeeping conundrum to deal with if they are to claw their way back to the top.
""There was a lot of talk after week one that this Man City team were back,"" former Everton midfielder Leon Osman said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I think this lets everybody take a step back and reassess that.
""They were way off the level that Spurs were at today.""

Son and Muller celebrate first MLS goals,Former Tottenham captain Son Heung-min and ex-Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller score their first Major League Soccer goals.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj0yg46zve8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 24 Aug 2025 06:35:29",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Former Tottenham captain Son Heung-min and ex-Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller both registered their first Major League Soccer goals on Saturday.
South Korea star Son, 33, scored a stunning free-kick just six minutes into his second start for Los Angeles FC, who drew 1-1 with FC Dallas.
It was Son's third appearance since ending his 10-year stay in the Premier League for a record MLS fee in excess of £20m.
""I'm glad I scored [my] first goal [in] the MLS and also for LAFC. But for me, the most important thing is to get three points. I'm really, really disappointed for that,"" Son said.
""I need still a lot of time to be connecting with the team. It's been only two weeks - maybe a little bit more - but I'm enjoying every single moment.""
German Muller, 35, converted a penalty in the 14th minute of stoppage-time to clinch a dramatic 3-2 victory for Vancouver Whitecaps against St Louis City.
Muller, whose 25-year association with Bayern Munich ended with the expiration of his contract this summer, captained his new side in his first start after making a substitute appearance last week.
""That I was able to score the final goal in front of our crowd here, it was an amazing feeling, amazing,"" Muller said.

'A creative and explosive talent' - Eze signs for Arsenal,Arsenal complete the signing of England forward Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y077p4z7vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 23 Aug 2025 16:44:11",Tom Mallows,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have completed the signing of England forward Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace.
The Gunners agreed a deal worth £60m, including £8m in add-ons, for the 27-year-old to become their seventh summer signing.
Eze had been one of Tottenham's prime targets this summer and Spurs had agreed terms with both Palace and Eze.
But Spurs' north London rivals then made a move for Eze on Wednesday and the boyhood Arsenal fan chose to rejoin the Gunners having started his youth career with the club.
A relaxed Eze, wearing an Arsenal shirt and jeans, sauntered out to a rapturous reception from fans before the match against Leeds.
Sporting director Andrea Berta described Eze as a ""creative and explosive talent with huge technical quality"".
Manager Mikel Arteta said: ""He is a powerful and exciting player who will give us a new dimension in our attacking game. What stands out just as much as his talent and intelligence as a player, is the way he has worked hard throughout his career to get where he is today.
""His journey, his mentality and his ambition are exactly what we want in our team, and we love how much it means to him and his family to be joining our club.""
Eze, who was raised in Greenwich, south-east London, began his senior career with QPR after leaving Arsenal, before making a £19.5m move to Palace in 2020.
In June 2023 he earned his first England cap and five months later he signed a contract extension with Palace to 2027.
Eze scored 40 goals in 169 games for Palace and claimed 14 goals and 11 assists in all competitions last season, including the only goal in the FA Cup final.
He started the Eagles' Premier League opener at Chelsea last week but missed Thursday's Europa Conference play-off.
How did Gunners hijack Spurs deal?
Arsenal had a long-standing interest in Eze but secured other attacking targets earlier this summer, allowing Tottenham to move to the brink of securing his signature.
Although Eze had agreed to join Spurs, Palace wanted to keep him for Thursday's game with Fredrikstad so the move was not completed.
Meanwhile, Arsenal were assessing a knee injury to forward Kai Havertz and decided to make a move for Eze, submitting a bid on Wednesday afternoon.
Given his connection to the club, Eze chose to join the Gunners over Spurs, which is sure to make him an instant fans' favourite at Emirates Stadium.
It seemed Arsenal were not going to pursue a deal for Eze after signing Chelsea winger Noni Madueke, while youngster Ethan Nwaneri signed a new long-term contract.
But Havertz then got injured and instead of looking to bring in a loan signing as cover, the Gunners sensed an opportunity to deny their rivals another transfer target after Spurs failed to secure a deal for Nottingham Forest attacking midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White earlier this summer.
Eze's arrival takes Mikel Arteta's spending beyond £200m this summer as Arsenal aim to end a run of five straight seasons without a trophy.
'Palace will live in my heart forever'
Shortly after the deal was announced, Eze posted an emotional thank you message to Crystal Palace on social media, describing his relationship with the fans as a ""love shared that will last a lifetime"".
He said: ""It feels like just yesterday I was walking through the doors joining from QPR. The day you gave me the chance to realise my dream of playing in the Premier League, for south London's biggest club.
""They call us a family club because it's impossible to truly understand what it's like to be part of this club unless you're in it. They're not wrong.
""Throughout the challenges of the Covid times, from the day I tore my Achilles and the long road of recovery, to that night at Selhurst against Villa when I came back, up until this very day, the love you have all shown me, the way you have all supported me, and how we've stood together no matter what, these are things that will live in my heart forever.""
