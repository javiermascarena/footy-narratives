Man Utd hopeful of finalising Mbeumo deal in time for US tour,Manchester United remain optimistic of agreeing a deal to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo in time for the forward to be part of their pre-season tour of the United States.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13394462/bryan-mbeumo-transfer-news-man-utd-hopeful-of-finalising-deal-for-brentford-forward-in-time-for-preseason-tour-of-us,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 12:00:00",Dharmesh Sheth,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United remain optimistic of agreeing a deal to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo in time for the forward to be part of their pre-season tour of the United States.
United kick off their US tour with a game against West Ham in New Jersey on July 26.
Sky Sports News understands there is a cautious optimism at United that a deal can be struck and discussions continue internally over the next steps.
There remains a gap in valuation, but United are not far away from the overall fee Brentford want - believed to be £65m - however there is still work to do on the structure as the west London club want the majority, if not all, of the fee to be paid up front.
Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.
Bees sporting director Phil Giles told Sky Sports News last week that Mbeumo would be happy to stay at the club if a deal - which has to be ""right for Brentford"" - does not materialise.
United are also still working on outgoings and, despite being given extra time to find a solution on his future, Marcus Rashford has returned to the club's training ground at Carrington.
The striker is training away from the first team and using the club's medical and rehab facilities.
Rashford's preference is a move to Barca, who have explored the conditions of a deal, but they have other targets in that position too such as Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.
Williams has signed a new contract at Athletic Club and Liverpool have rejected all approaches for Diaz, however.
Antony is another player United are happy to sell and Real Betis are still pushing for a deal for the winger.
Talks between the clubs have been over a permanent deal - but it is thought the idea of another loan has been broached.
However, for United to consider another loan this summer, it is thought they would want an obligation to buy him attached.
The Betis president has admitted a permanent deal is difficult to do given the finances involved.
Antony impressed on a straight loan in the second half of last season at Betis, scoring nine goals in 24 appearances.
Elsewhere, Juventus and Napoli remain interested in a deal for United forward Jadon Sancho.
Both clubs have been made aware by United what fee it would take to sign Sancho - believed to be £25m, with the sides both discussing terms with the England international's representatives.
Juve have other targets, including Porto's Francsico Conceicao, however, and Sky in Italy are reporting that the Portugal international is their preferred choice.
Conceicao was on a season-long loan in Turin last season and, until and including July 15, his release clause is €30m, which Porto want paid up front in full, although it goes up to €45m on July 16.

Spurs agree £55m deal for West Ham's Kudus,Tottenham have agreed a deal with West Ham to sign Mohammed Kudus.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13393510/mohammed-kudus-transfer-news-tottenham-agree-55m-deal-to-sign-west-ham-forward,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:00:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have agreed a deal with West Ham to sign Mohammed Kudus.
The fee for the 24-year-old forward is understood to be around £55m.
Kudus is set to begin his medical with Spurs on Thursday ahead of signing a six-year contract.
Chelsea and Newcastle also showed interest in Kudus earlier in the window; however, Sky Sports News understands that the player only wants to move to Spurs at this time.
Spurs are looking to sign a forward who can play across the front line and Kudus fits that bill.
The former Ajax forward has scored 13 goals and set up 12 in 65 Premier League games since arriving from the Eredivisie in the summer window of 2023.
If it goes through, this will be the first transfer between the two rivals since Scott Parker joined Spurs from West Ham in 2011.
Spurs remain interested in Brentford's Yoane Wissa after the expected arrival of Kudus.
Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth:
""With Mohammed Kudus' imminent arrival, there have been question marks as to whether this will impact any of Tottenham's other activity.
""Well, they are after one of Thomas Frank's former players, Yoane Wissa. That pursuit, I'm told, will not be impacted by Kudus' imminent arrival.
""There's been no club-to-club contact between Tottenham and Brentford as of yet, but we expect that to be pretty soon.
""Wissa is into the final year of his contract and turns 29 in September, with those ingredients, Tottenham may feel that there is a deal to be done.""
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
Kudus is an exciting signing. Spurs rarely do business with West Ham - the Ghanaian is the first purchase from their rivals in 14 years - but Kudus was deemed talented enough to be the exception.
Kudus is just about to turn 25, adds much-needed depth to Spurs' wide attacking positions and, after two seasons in east London, is well aware of the demands of the Premier League.
But how much of a concern should his second season for West Ham be?
Kudus was named as the division's best newcomer by Sky Sports' Gary Neville in the Monday Night Football awards at the end of the 2023/24 season. A £38m purchase from Ajax looked like a bargain for West Ham, with Kudus scoring 14 times across all competitions, setting up nine more goals and bringing excitement to the London Stadium with his lightning, direct dribbles.
But there were just five goals in all last term. As well as one at Spurs, his only other goals came home and away against Brighton and Ipswich, with his final strike of the season arriving with just three minutes to play against relegated opposition at Portman Road.
Statistically it was a disappointing dip from the promise of that first campaign. There were, though, caveats around West Ham's form and also the positions Kudus was asked to play during the 2024/25 season, plugging gaps across the frontline as injuries struck.
Will a Tottenham team that finished three places below the Hammers but scored 18 more goals provide the environment to help Kudus fire like he did in that first year in England?
The approach of new Spurs boss Thomas Frank will be significant. Bryan Mbeumo, a left-footer like Kudus, starred on the right side of Frank's attack at Brentford, scoring 20 times last season. Could Frank help Kudus get near those levels?
Spurs believe the answer is yes to both of those questions and now Kudus has a fresh platform to reignite the buzz which came with his first campaign in England.

Tottenham agree £55m fee for West Ham's Kudus,Tottenham agree a £55m fee with West Ham to sign midfielder Mohammed Kudus.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62dv0n74ryo,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:04:01",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have agreed a £55m fee with West Ham to sign midfielder Mohammed Kudus.
The Ghana international is now set to have a medical before signing a long-term contract.
BBC Sport reported on Saturday that the Hammers had rejected an initial £50m but a deal has now been clinched.
Kudus, who has an £85m release clause, joined West Ham in a £38m deal from Ajax in 2023. He has made 65 Premier League appearances for the club, scoring 13 goals and providing nine assists.
At least six top clubs have enquired about Kudus in recent weeks but well-placed sources told BBC Sport the 24-year-old had prioritised a move to Spurs.
Meanwhile, Tottenham are also exploring a move for Brentford forward Yoane Wissa.
'Kudus highly rated by many'
Phil McNulty, chief football writer
Kudus is highly rated by many very good judges.
When I spoke to Danny Murphy at the end of last season about players Liverpool should be looking at this summer, he named Kudus as one. The player is sought after - despite being as underwhelming last season as he was electrifying in 2023-24 following a £38m move from Ajax.
He only scored five goals in the most recent campaign, down from 14 the year before, and was often ineffective in the system preferred by head coach Graham Potter, who took charge in January and favours wing-backs over wingers.
Kudus was often utilised up front by Potter and seldom featured wide on the right, arguably his best position, but one in which West Ham already have captain Jarrod Bowen.

BBC Sport reported that the Gunners had already agreed personal terms with Madueke last week ahead of any potential move, but they have now made an official approach.
It is understood Chelsea are looking for a fee in the region of £50m for the 23-year-old England international.
Madueke is currently part of Chelsea's squad at the Club World Cup and came on as a substitute as the Blues reached the final of the competition after beating Brazilian side Fluminense 2-0.
The wideman has played 92 times for Chelsea since joining them from PSV Eindhoven in January 2023 and scored 20 goals.
Madueke was in Tottenham's academy before spending four and a half years in the Netherlands.
Arsenal are looking to increase their attacking options with both Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze under consideration.
The Gunners have also stepped up efforts to sign striker Viktor Gyokeres, with Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta holding face-to-face talks with Sporting in Portugal.

Man Utd want to host 2035 Women's World Cup final,Manchester United want their new stadium to host the Women's World Cup final in 2035.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2v0nw2819o,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 19:52:10",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United want to host the 2035 Women's World Cup final in their new 100,000-seater stadium.
The club announced plans to build the biggest stadium in the UK - an ""iconic"" new £2bn ground close to Old Trafford - in March.
And they still hope to realise co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's desire for a 'new' Old Trafford to be completed within five to six years - despite widespread doubts outside the club over the likelihood of hitting that timescale.
The 2035 Women's World Cup is expected to be held across the four nations of the United Kingdom, which is the sole bidder.
The Football Association is working on a bid to present to football's world governing body Fifa by the end of the year, setting out its vision for the tournament.
Club sources say they anticipate the new stadium being open a long time before 2035 and believe Ratcliffe's stated timescale from his March announcement is still valid.
But they also acknowledge the potential for delays around such a complex plan.
The club's ambition was announced as Lord Coe was named as Chair-Designate of the Mayoral Development Corporation for the Old Trafford Regeneration project, a move which Manchester United have welcomed.
He was previously the chair of the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force set up by Ratcliffe last year to examine the feasibility of a new 100,000-capacity stadium for United, the first drawings for which were unveiled in London almost four months ago.
He has also chaired London's successful 2012 Olympic and Paralympic bid.
United chief executive Omar Berrada said: ""The continuity it brings for the wider project will be a huge positive.
""In addition, Lord Coe's proven leadership and track record in delivering transformational projects will be invaluable as we work together to turn our collective vision into reality.""
Challenges facing 2030 completion date
Industry and football experts outside Old Trafford have identified numerous reasons why completion in 2030 may be unlikely, with one saying privately if the spades are in the ground within two years, United will have done very well.
Early discussions over how to fund the £2bn project have begun, although this is being done at the same time as the club are in negotiations over the refinancing of significant chunks of United's current debt.
While those specific loans are not set to expire until 2027, informed sources say they need to be refinanced a year before that. In their latest financial statement in June, United confirmed £327.9m of its 'senior secured notes' and £180m of its revolving credit facility is set to mature on 25 June 2027.
It is thought highly unlikely United will look to load its stadium debt on to that sum at a time when global interest rates are rising.
Ratcliffe and co-owners the Glazer family have the option of putting in the sums themselves, or reducing their stake in the club through a share sale, but neither of these options are felt to be realistic either.
Outsiders think the most likely option is having a subsidiary company own the stadium, which could bring in investment.
Yet others feel the economics of building a 100,000-capacity stadium from scratch requires the men's first team to be a far more attractive proposition than they are now because a significant number of corporate tickets will have to be sold to make it financially viable.
A secondary complication is whether there is a possibility of being able to buy nearby land currently being used for the Freight Liner terminal.
There is still time to tone down some of the more expensive elements of the vision Ratcliffe unveiled in March.
United's chief operating officer Collette Roche will lead the club's drive on the project, with fan focus groups set to discuss key aspects, including seating and pricing options, in a series of meetings next week.
It is not known yet when planning permission will be submitted, although issues such as transport expansion will be dealt with at local government level, with United's input.
""This is about so much more than just a stadium,"" said Lord Coe.
""It's about listening to and working with residents to create a vibrant, inclusive district, with high quality housing, green spaces, world class leisure and education facilities, and improved transport links.
""Twenty years on from securing the Olympic and Paralympic Games for this country, I'm ready to help deliver a vision of equal scale and ambition. I can't wait to get started.""

BBC Sport understands Brentford have been made aware of their London rivals' interest in the 28-year-old, in a deal that could reunite the forward with his former manager Thomas Frank, now in charge at Spurs.
Sources have indicated that Wissa is open to a move across the capital. Wissa has courted major interest from Premier League clubs in recent months, Nottingham Forest failing to sign the DR Congo international in January.
But Spurs now have an interest in the former Lorient player, who scored 20 goals last season.
Wissa's current deal expires next summer - but there is an option to extend it by a further year.
It is understood Brentford are reluctant to lose Wissa this summer, having already lost manager Frank, captain Christian Norgaard to Arsenal and goalkeeper Mark Flekken to Bayer Leverkusen.

While their offer hasn't been accepted, negotiations remain positive, with the 25-year-old keen to leave Stamford Bridge to become a first-team starter.
The Cherries have been tracking Petrovic's situation for more than a year and are looking to sign a replacement for Kepa Arrizabalaga, who spent last season with them on loan from Chelsea, but joined Arsenal permanently at the start of July when his £5m release clause was triggered.
Bournemouth have been made aware of an image rights issue that needs resolving to sign Serbia international Petrovic, who is valued at around £25m and agreed an initial seven-year contract with the Blues from New England Revolution in 2023.
There is interest too from Sunderland, Monaco and also Strasbourg, where Petrovic enjoyed a successful loan spell in the previous campaign and won their player of the season award.
Strasbourg are also owned by the same Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital ownership as Chelsea, and Petrovic ended up at the French club after being deemed not good enough with his feet by manager Enzo Maresca.
He has made substantial improvement in that area during his spell in Ligue 1, but Petrovic has pushed to leave the Blues, opting against a call-up to their Club World Cup squad.
Robert Sanchez, Filip Jorgensen and summer signing Mike Penders are in the United States, where Chelsea have reached the final of Fifa's extended tournament.

‘We didn’t put the brakes on’: Luis Enrique denies PSG spared Real Madrid,Several key players substituted as PSG romped to 4-0 win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/10/we-didnt-put-the-brakes-on-luis-enrique-denies-psg-spared-real-madrid,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 23:15:17",Sid Lowe,['Chelsea'],"On the afternoon that Paris Saint-Germain reached the final of the Club World Cup, placing them 90 minutes away from winning every trophy available this season, Luis Enrique underlined how far they had come by recalling: “In January, people said we didn’t have leaders and didn’t score goals.” Since then they have scored more than 100 and won their first ever Champions league with a 5-0 victory against Inter in the final. Here they put four past Real Madrid with a display so dominant that he had to deny that they had taken their foot off the gas.
In doing so, however, the PSG head coach did reveal that he had made changes with Sunday’s final against Chelsea in mind. PSG were two goals up inside 10 minutes and had made it 3-0 before they had played half an hour, the game effectively over, before Gonçalo Ramos added a fourth in the dying minutes.
The second half had been played out at a reduced pace and PSG made a series of substitutions involving key players with Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Fabián Ruiz, Nuno Mendes, Ousmane Dembélé and Désiré Doué all removed. At times it felt like the only thing that prevented them from scoring more was that they did not need to and there was no desire to keep tearing into their opponents.
“My phone is full of messages from Barcelona fans, which tells you about how big this game was,” Luis Enrique said. “You go at 100% for everything this shirt represents and we know what Real Madrid are, what they were and what they will always be, how great they are. We didn’t put the brakes on but of course with the heat, with the final in three days’ time, with cramp and the risk of tiredness, you act. The first thing is the objective, which is to reach the final and compete. But at no point do you put the brakes on.”
“This was an objective from the start,” the PSG head coach added. “And now we are just one game away from building PSG’s history, and winning all the trophies we have participated in this season. It means a lot for us, for our fans and it is a pleasure to work at this club. We have scored 100-plus goals and we let in very few. These players are exceptional.” Asked for the key, Luis Enrique said: “The insuperable play of my players and their generosity, the way they give everything at the service of the team.”
Xabi Alonso insisted the defeat “hurt” but that he had learnt a lot over the six games he has been in charge of Real Madrid at this Club World Cup. “I leave here with lots of certainties, and next year will be different,” he said. “There are positive things and we leave here as a better team even if it is difficult to say that right now. This game and this competition has told me lots of things about what we are, what we need to improve, the changes there will be. These were the last game of 2024-25, not the first games of 2025-26.”

Spurs agree £54.5m deal to buy Mohammed Kudus from West Ham,Ghana attacker will sign six-year deal subject to medical,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/09/spurs-agree-deal-buy-mohammed-kudus-west-ham,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:26:17",Jacob Steinberg,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have reached an agreement to sign Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for £54.5m.
Kudus is due to undergo a medical on Thursday and will sign a six-year deal. The Ghana attacker will become the first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker in 2011.
West Ham’s decision to sell Kudus to their London rivals is down to their needing to revamp their squad without inviting a potential breach of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations. Sources at the London Stadium are adamant that West Ham must sell to buy. They want a goalkeeper, a left centre-back, a left wing-back, at least two midfielders and a striker.
Kudus had an £85m release clause valid for Premier League sides for the first 10 days of July but West Ham were always likely to accept a lower fee. He was deemed the club’s most sellable asset and has attracted plenty of interest. Spurs have made the strongest push for the 24-year-old and had a £50m bid rejected last week. The payment is to be spread over three years.
West Ham are comfortable with allowing Kudus to leave, reasoning that he is best playing on the right – the same position as the captain, Jarrod Bowen. Graham Potter does not feel that Kudus is capable of playing in a central role in the Premier League. It is understood Kudus was twice late for training this week and had requested a transfer.
Kudus impressed after joining West Ham from Ajax for £37m two years ago but struggled last season. He clashed with Potter’s predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, and managed four goals in all competitions. He served a lengthy ban after a red card during a 4-1 defeat by Spurs last October.
That dismissal has not stopped Tottenham from going for him. Kudus will boost Thomas Frank’s options in the final third and his arrival represents a show of intent as Spurs look to rebuild after replacing Ange Postecoglou with the Dane.

"Transfer latest: Arsenal open Madueke talks with Chelsea, Everton sign £27m striker Barry",Madueke not expected to end Arsenal’s interest in Eze,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/09/arsenal-open-talks-chelsea-signing-noni-madueke,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 15:09:05",Jacob Steinberg,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Arsenal have opened talks with Chelsea over signing Noni Madueke. Personal terms have been agreed with the winger, who is increasingly likely to move to the Emirates Stadium.
Chelsea have been revamping their attack and decided they were open to selling Madueke after winning the Conference League in May. The 23-year-old has had a bit-part role during his side’s run to the Club World Cup final and is likely to benefit from a change of scenery. Madueke made a late substitute appearance during the win over Fluminense in the semi-final.
Arsenal are looking to boost their options on the flanks and identified Madueke as a key target last month. Chelsea will use Anthony Elanga’s £55m move to Newcastle from Nottingham Forest as a guide for Madueke’s valuation. Arsenal are likely to push for a lower fee, with negotiations continuing.
The England international’s appeal lies in his speed and ability to play on both flanks. He could provide cover for Bukayo Saka on the right and give Arsenal a left-footed option on the opposite side. Madueke has scored 13 goals and provided seven assists in 67 Premier League appearances. The move is not expected to end Arsenal’s interest in Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze.
Enzo Maresca has spoken positively about Madueke but there is a feeling at Chelsea that the former PSV attacker has not progressed enough.
Madueke has predominantly played on the right for Chelsea but is likely to be behind Pedro Neto and Estêvão Willian next season, and Geovany Quenda is due to join in 2026. Chelsea have also boosted their wide options by signing Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund. João Pedro and Liam Delap have also been bought and Christopher Nkunku could provide further depth if he stays. Tyrique George is likely to go on loan.
Bournemouth have submitted a £25m bid for Djordje Petrovic. The goalkeeper is poised to leave Chelsea and has also been targeted by Sunderland but the Cherries are favourites to sign the Serb.
Everton have confirmed the signing of Thierno Barry from Villarreal for a fee understood to be £27m. The 6ft 5in striker, part of the France squad at the recent European Under-21 Championship, scored 11 goals in La Liga last season. The 22-year-old is David Moyes’s second summer signing, after the £12.6m deal to sign Carlos Alcaraz permanently.
Barry, who joined Villarreal from Basel last summer, named Wayne Rooney and Romelu Lukaku as former Everton players he enjoyed watching and hoped to emulate. He is hoping to make an impression on Everton’s supporters. “I think the fans here are, like, crazy people ... I like this,” he told the club’s website. “I like to score for these people.”
The Belgian winger Chemsdine Talbi has become Sunderland’s fifth summer signing, joining from Club Brugge. The 20-year-old, who has signed a five-year contract, is understood to have cost about £19.5m.

The most aggressive set-piece team in the world plays in Minnesota,"Under the guidance of a former Manchester United assistant, Minnesota United are finding MLS success with a surprising tactic",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/09/minnesota-united-set-pieces-throw-ins-free-kicks-tactics,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 09:00:46",MLS,['Manchester United'],"Not many soccer players are as passionate about dead balls as Anthony Markanich. Then again Minnesota United, under the 33-year-old first-time head coach Eric Ramsay, don’t play soccer like most teams.
“All the guys get really excited about set pieces, especially myself,” Markanich gushed last Friday after scoring a goal off a long throw-in by the center back Michael Boxall for the second time in a week. “I told Boxy I love when he has the ball for throw-ins and stuff – I get so excited about that.”
The wingback’s match-winner against FC Dallas marked the third straight game Minnesota have scored from a long throw into the penalty area. It was their sixth throw-in goal before the MLS All-Star break – which falls about two-thirds of the way through the season. That’s as many as Brentford’s famous long throws produced all last season in the Premier League.
Even though they’re chucking more balls into the box than any Major League Soccer side in at least a decade, long throws might not be the Loons’ most distinctive set piece routine. They’ve also borrowed a page from Sean Dyche’s playbook by bringing their goalkeeper up to wallop free kicks into the opposition’s box from around the halfway line, where almost any other team would tap the ball sideways to resume ordinary midfield possession.
Minnesota’s oddball tactics aren’t just outliers in MLS. According to an analysis by Soccerment, a soccer data company, they take more long throws and deep free kicks than any other club in 30 of the world’s top leagues, from the Bundesliga to the Brasileirão. The low-budget overachievers sitting third in the MLS Western Conference just might be the most aggressive set piece team on the planet.
Ramsay’s commitment to putting any possible dead ball into the mixer may look strange, even old-fashioned, but there’s evidence to support continuing to do it. Across leagues, seasons and playing styles, long throws into the box are twice as likely to lead to a goal in the next 30 seconds as other throw-ins in the final quarter of the pitch. The same goes for deep free kicks into the “Dyche Zone” at the top of the opponent’s box, which are twice as valuable as other free kicks taken between the edge of a team’s defensive third and the halfway line.
Like the Moneyball-era Oakland A’s, Minnesota found an analytical edge out of financial necessity. Ramsay’s squad ranks 26th out of 30 MLS teams for player compensation, which has put an expensive passing game all but out of reach. “It’s not that we’re a club that is unwilling to spend, but since I’ve been here, there’s been a real efficiency drive,” he said. “Ultimately where we use set plays, it comes from wanting to squeeze every advantage that we possibly can from the group of players that we’ve got.”
Ramsay joined the MLS side last year from an assistant role at Manchester United, where he studied how teams like Brentford, Newcastle and Dyche’s Burnley used direct set pieces to punch above their weight in the Premier League.
“Obviously it’s not escaped my attention that teams with smaller budgets can out-compete teams right at the top end through set plays,” he said. “It was one of the things I looked at from afar and thought prior to coming in that we could find an advantage.”
In the Twin Cities, he found a squad well suited for long set pieces. Their strengths are a sturdy defensive line and a pair of tall strikers who excel on fast breaks, so there hasn’t been much downside to bypassing midfield possession for booming free kicks from the goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair or throw-ins from the New Zealand international Boxall, who can hurl the ball 30 yards from a near-standstill.
“I think particularly when it comes to how we use throw-ins and deep free kicks, we probably give away between five and 10% what would be very easy possession in order to be high value in those situations,” Ramsay explained. “If we wanted to have 47% of the ball consistently, we could do it like that. We would just choose to use set plays in a different way.”
Their unstoppable long throw-ins can look hilariously easy. Markanich’s two goals last week came from near-mirror image throws to a trio of Minnesota players jostling for position at the near corner of the six-yard box while he waited behind them in the center of goal and the striker Kelvin Yeboah peeled off from the penalty spot to help hunt for a flick-on header. “Everyone’s just wanting to flick the ball on,” Markanich said. “I think everyone knows their roles, especially on set pieces.”
Deep free kicks have more tactical variety depending on where they’re taken, but every set piece starts from principles that Ramsay rattles off like a pop quiz: “Do you have the right number of players in the contact area? Is the thrower or the set piece taker able to, with a real degree of accuracy, put the ball into a certain spot? Are you really well set for the second contact, and are the players on the move for the second contact?
“How is it that when the ball breaks to the edge of the box for a second, third or fourth phase, you can recycle the ball in order to get a second or third chance and continually upgrade the quality of your opportunity as you go?”

This is the big idea behind Ramsay’s set pieces: not that they’ll score every time from a perfect routine, but that by using each stoppage to cram a bunch of bodies and the ball into a small area around the opponent’s goal, his side can force errors, win second balls and string together chance after chance, set piece after set piece, always ratcheting up the pressure.
New phase-of-play data from the livescore app Futi supports this line of thought. (I co-founded Futi with the data scientist Mike Imburgio, who consults on Minnesota’s recruitment but isn’t involved with set pieces.) Though only 14% of Minnesota’s throw-ins into the box produce a shot, they lead to another set piece 20% of the time. Similarly, 45% of the team’s deep free kicks reach a second phase where the ball bounces around the box while the defense is still disorganized. The Loons haven’t managed a single shot in the first phase of a Dyche Zone free kick but they’ve scored three goals during those dangerous second phases, plus another from a subsequent corner kick.
Add it all up and the value of Minnesota’s aggressive set pieces is astonishing: their 10 goals within 45 seconds of a long throw or deep free kick represent nearly a third of the team’s season total. Though their entire squad earns about half of Lionel Messi’s salary at Inter Miami, Minnesota are perched above Miami in the Supporters Shield standings and doing a pretty good job of recreating Messi in the aggregate just by lobbing dead balls into the box.
Fans have bought into a style that might have been a tough sell if it weren’t so hard to argue with results. “There’s a bit of an aura around us in set plays, particularly at home,” Ramsay said. “Our crowd are wild for set plays. At corners, every single member of the crowd is swinging the scarf around.”
After years of decline, long throws into the box are on the upswing in MLS and the Premier League. A new generation of managers such as Eddie Howe and Graham Potter are reconsidering deep free kicks, which like Dyche himself had fallen out of fashion as too “pragmatic.” What looks exotic now may one day be as normal as putting kickoffs out of bounds near the corner flag or building out of the back from a short goal kick.
“I don’t think anything we do is rocket science. I don’t think it will take the opposition long to work out what sits behind our success,” Ramsay said of his team’s extraordinary set piece record after the win in Dallas. “But stopping it is very different.”

Football transfer rumours: Ferran Torres to swap Barcelona for Aston Villa?,Today’s tell-all is faxing in its offers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/09/football-transfer-rumours-ferran-torres-to-swap-barcelona-for-aston-villa,"Wed, 09 Jul 2025 08:57:36",Tom Davies,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Fresh from selling their women’s team to their wholly separate, er, parent company, Aston Villa feel in the mood for waving their wedge about, with Ferran Torres their target. The Spanish site Fichajes says that Barcelona, no strangers themselves to imaginative accountancy flexes, have been sounded out for a £43m move for the forward.
Eberechi Eze to Arsenal seems to have acquired some momentum since the Mill first mulled it over on Tuesday, and the Sun is now touting the Gunners as clear favourites to gazump their rivals Tottenham to the Crystal Palace attacking midfielder’s signature. Palace are holding out for £68m but Arsenal’s sporting director, Andrea Berta, has apparently held talks with Eze’s people as interest is stepped up.
Liverpool have been busy buying forwards this summer but one big name heading out the door might be Luis Díaz. Goal.com reports that the Colombian is weighing up his options and being notably noncommittal amid interest from Bayern Munich, Barcelona and the Saudi Pro League, though he has also insisted he remains happy on Merseyside. Darwin Núñez is a likelier departure, with Napoli lodging a £42m bid for the Uruguay frontman.
If Bayern don’t land Díaz, they might have a better chance of snapping up Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku. The Bundesliga champions have sounded out a loan move for the 27-year-old French forward in the past but Chelsea want a straight sale and Bayern remain interested.
Wednesday’s Jadon Sancho news has the winger being prepared to take a pay cut to facilitate a move from Manchester United to Juventus. United are still holding out for a £25m transfer fee but the wage bill on top of that would be substantial. Il Corriere dello Sport reports that Sancho is ready to accept a £7m-a-year deal but Juve want no more than €6m (£5.2m) plus add-ons.
Everton, eager to boost a threadbare squad, have been linked with the highly regarded Middlesbrough midfielder Hayden Hackney, though they may face competition domestically from Brentford, Fulham, Crystal Palace and West Ham, not to mention abroad from Porto and Stuttgart.
Sunderland are closing in on a deal for Club Brugge’s Chemsdine Talbi, reports transfer news guru Fabrizio Romano. The winger is poised to complete a €23m (£19.8m) move to Régis Le Bris’s newly promoted side. Their fellow promotees Burnley could be losing Maxime Estève to Tottenham. According to L’Equipe, Spurs have “resumed discussions” with Burnley over a move for the 23-year-old French centre-back, who was an ever-present in Scott Parker’s side last term.
And Saudi Arabia’s Al-Qadsiah have made a £45.7m offer for Mateo Retegui but Atalanta are having none of it apparently, and want around £6m more for their valued Italy striker.
