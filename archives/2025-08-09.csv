"Liverpool target Isak to miss Newcastle PL opener, says Howe",Newcastle boss Eddie Howe insists Liverpool transfer target Alexander Isak still has a future at St James' Park - but says the striker cannot currently be involved with the squad and will miss their Premier League opener with Aston Villa.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13408864/alexander-isak-transfer-news-eddie-howe-says-liverpool-target-cannot-train-with-newcastle-squad-but-still-has-future-at-club,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 22:16:00",,['Liverpool'],"Newcastle boss Eddie Howe insists Liverpool transfer target Alexander Isak still has a future at St James' Park - but says the striker cannot currently be involved with the squad and will miss their Premier League opener with Aston Villa.
Isak was back at Newcastle's facility on Monday morning having missed their pre-season tour and trained away from the rest of the squad, as instructed by Howe.
The Magpies rejected an opening offer of £110m plus add-ons from Liverpool on August 1, after Isak told the club he wanted to explore his options in the transfer window.
Isak was not involved in Newcastle's penultimate friendly of the summer against Espanyol, a 2-2 draw which saw William Osula start up front, with Howe refusing to put a timeline on when the Sweden international would return to the first-team fold.
Howe does not expect any resolution to the situation before their season opener at Villa Park next Saturday. He said on Friday: ""I'd want Alex to be playing today, I'd want him training tomorrow. We would love the player to be with us - let me make that absolutely clear. There's no part of me that doesn't want that outcome.
""But I don't see that changing before Aston Villa, the current situation we're in.""
Speaking further after the friendly at St James' Park, Howe said he had been in talks with Isak about finding a resolution.
""We've had discussions and it's clear at the moment we can't have him involved with the group,"" said Howe.
""I don't know how long that will be for. It's clear I can't involve him with the team at the moment.
""He is training later than the rest of the squad. There have been discussions since the tour. I don't think disciplinary action has happened.""
When pushed for an answer on whether Isak has a future at the club, Howe added: ""He is here, so of course he has a future at Newcastle. From our perspective, we would love to have him back with the team, but the situation has to be right for that to happen.
""He doesn't have a fitness issue. I'm aware of a feeling within the squad that there's something there not to the benefit of the group.""
Isak had previously been training at his former club Real Sociedad's headquarters on his own, after missing Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia.
Asked if the club could simply dig in their heels and refuse to sell their star frontman, Howe said: ""I don't think it's that straightforward, otherwise we'd have done that a long time ago. I don't think we're in a position to do that currently.
""I don't want to go into too much detail because I don't think that's right. I think I've said enough.""
The club's failure to land many potential signings has prompted suggestions that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which owns an 85 per cent stake, is not as engaged as it once was.
However, Howe, who admitted the Isak situation has unsettled a previously united squad, was unequivocal in his denial.
He said: ""The owners are very much engaged, as much as they always have been.
""This has been a challenging period where there'll be a lot of different opinions on different subjects, but I can assure everybody connected with Newcastle that the owners are very much behind the project and fighting every day for the club.""
Latest from Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth, Amar Mehta and Vik Varange:
Newcastle are set to miss out on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, with the player currently in the UK to finalise his move to Manchester United.
The deal breaks down to an initial £66.3m (€76.5m) and £7.37m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons.
The club's summer goes from bad to worse with Sesko becoming the eighth player they have been unable to secure.
The club has missed out on Dean Huijsen, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, James Trafford, Hugo Ekitike and now Sesko.
Seven of those players have signed, or are set to sign, for their Premier League rivals.
Newcastle first offered an initial fee of £65.3m plus £4.36m of add-ons (€75m+€5m) and then upped their bid to £69.7m (€80m) as a fixed fee plus add-ons.
Man Utd's agreed deal is an initial £66.3m (€76.5m) fee plus £7.37m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons.
From this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

"Pedro holds advantage over Delap as Estevao, Gittens shine vs Leverkusen","Chelsea secured a 2-0 win against Erik ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen in their first pre-season friendly. Here, we examine some of the big talking points from their performance...",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13408824/chelsea-joao-pedro-holds-advantage-over-liam-delap-as-estevao-willian-and-jamie-gittens-shine-against-bayer-leverkusen,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 21:27:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea secured a 2-0 win against Erik ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen in their first pre-season friendly. Here, we examine some of the big talking points from their performance...
Liam Delap's bid to become Chelsea's first-choice striker had started well before their friendly against Bayer Leverkusen had even begun, but it ended with him on the back foot.
Sky Sports News reported ahead of kick-off that Nicolas Jackson's absence from the matchday squad was due to the striker telling the club he wanted to explore his transfer options this summer.
Delap would have already been buoyed by being handed his first start at Stamford Bridge yet after 15 minutes, he had just one touch.
With his second, he sent a shot straight at goalkeeper Mark Flekken, who then made his best save, spreading himself to deny Delap's poked effort at goal.
Delap's movement in behind, to latch onto Tyrique George's curling cross, was faultless, but he had to score. Two shots, both on target, both big chances missed.
Joao Pedro then showed him how to do it. He composed himself in the area before clinically sending an effort into the bottom left corner to give himself the advantage. The battle recommences on Sunday.David Richardson
Debuts do not get much better than Estevao Willian's at Stamford Bridge.
Anticipation and excitement for the 18-year-old talent from Palmeiras was already high heading into this fixture but he exceeded all expectations in his first appearance in a Chelsea shirt.
From minute one, Estevao dazzled with his ability on the ball and confidence when driving at defenders.
A natural chemistry with star-man Cole Palmer was clear to see from kick-off and it eventually paid dividends when the Brazil international swept home the opener after Palmer's shot bounced back into the penalty area off the bar.
Carving a way into this Chelsea starting line-up is not an easy task but this performance will have put the young winger firmly in contention for a starting role against Crystal Palace in the Blues' Premier League opener next Sunday, live on Sky Sports.Patrick Rowe
Another debutant for Chelsea and another strong performance to endear himself to the home crowd at Stamford Bridge.
Jamie Gittens, a £51.5m signing from Borussia Dortmund this summer, replaced George on the left wing in the 64th minute and wasted no time in displaying his full array of talents.
The 21-year-old showed clear intent with the ball, regularly drifted into dangerous areas and looked to facilitate his team-mates.
""It makes me want to push harder in training,"" Gittens told Channel 5 after the game when asked about the competition for places at the club.
""Everyone is so competitive, and I need that to push myself to the max.""
With links to Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho intensifying behind the scenes, securing a regular role in this line-up could get even harder.
However, if Gittens plays like he did during his brief cameo against Leverkusen, it will be difficult for Maresca to look past the winger.Patrick Rowe
Levi Colwill's ACL injury came as a significant blow to Chelsea this week on their return to training. It's given Maresca a problem to solve.
Colwill enjoyed a fine season at left centre-back last campaign, bringing composure to the backline and defining Chelsea's possession-based style. He had built a promising partnership with Trevoh Chalobah, who forced his way into the side after returning from a loan spell at Crystal Palace.
Chalobah is expected to start, but who will partner him? Josh Acheampong was given the starting audition against Leverkusen. The 19-year-old academy graduate played at right centre-back, with Chalobah moved to the other side.
Acheampong completed all 76 of his attempted passes, although only one of those was a long pass. Tosin replaced Chalobah at half-time and also didn't misplace a pass, hitting four long balls.
Tosin's telling contribution came when he deflected Leverkusen's best chance behind after Acheampong had fallen over the ball deep in his half.
Tosin, 27, has significantly more experience than Acheampong, with loan spells at West Brom and Blackburn in the Championship before playing 119 times for Fulham and making 44 appearances for Chelsea last season. It's his spot to lose.David Richardson

"Inside Man Utd's new £50m training base - F1 simulators, barbers and smart urinals","""I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.""",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13408843/manchester-united-inside-carrington-the-red-devils-new-and-improved-50m-training-base,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 08:00:00",Danyal Khan,['Manchester United'],"""I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.""
The words of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he cut the ribbon to re-open their men's training facilities.
It marks the conclusion of a year's worth of work at Carrington, which has been disruptive to say the least.
The knock-on effect on the men's and women's teams was far from ideal, but the important news for United is that the redevelopment has now finished and importantly, on time and within budget ahead of the new season.
United partnered with Foster + Partners to lead the redesign of Carrington - the same company who are in charge of designing their ambitious 100,000 capacity stadium.
When Ratcliffe and INEOS first arrived at United 18 months ago, one of their first major decisions was to revamp and invest in Carrington, in their image, as the beating heart of the club.
Although Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating facilities in 2022, perhaps in hindsight, his actions, rightly or wrongly, had an everlasting impact that led to Carrington's improvement.
Diogo Dalot, one of the longest-serving players at United now, told Sky Sports News after the re-opening: ""Getting people United and creating this dynamic between each other where we fight for each other every single day - this facility brings that message.""
""It sends a message that you're playing for the biggest club in the world.""
United believe that after finishing this huge renovation that their facilities are back to being among the best in class when compared to their rivals - a familiar feeling to when Carrington first opened in 2000.
Dalot was pretty happy with the players' revamped facilities but what are they really like?
United goalkeeper Tom Heaton described the improved facilities as much of a 'flow' for the players. I did not know quite what he meant until I had a look myself, and actually, it made a lot of sense.
From the ground floor, you immediately step into the players' gym - this was one of the only aspects of the building relatively untouched.
However, as you meander through to the active recovery rooms, this is where you start seeing major changes that will benefit United players for years to come.
A new high altitude room with multiple bikes and rowing machines have been installed - one in which the levels of temperature, humidity and more can be altered for a group of players to train in. This room at Carrington is believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in elite sport.
Then onto the pool area. Sauna and steam rooms have been improved and enlarged, with new additions as well, such as a small pool with an underwater treadmill. The treadmill can be elevated up and down to the appropriate height to aid those who need it for rehabilitating from injury.
The ""flow"" of the layout Heaton mentioned made a lot more sense at this point, as you really do feel everything is one, meaningful order of facilities for these players with their gym and recovery work - this will make more sense as I go on... Probably.
As we continue the tour, naturally, after the gym, we find ourselves in a long, bright hallway with the changing rooms and player services areas.
However, just before you to get to the first team changing room - interestingly enough - there's a door that says 'U23'. This is seen as the 'emerging talent' dressing room - a room breaking through to the first team and giving them a taste of what it is like to be in the first team building.
The likes of Chido Obi and Sekou Kone are a few names that spring to mind who could be using that room at the moment as they continue to make their mark on the first team.
Into the first team changing room we go - more spacious and brighter than its predecessor - with touchscreens on each player's space to go through their routine for the day.
One of the more odd facts we learned is that the changing rooms is that they include… 'smart urinals' - these help measure whether a player is dehydrated and just how much liquid they may need to get back to their ideal hydration levels.
One aspect Ruben Amorim hopes his players won't see too often is the new and improved treatment room. United see this as a huge improvement to the previous edition, especially after feedback from former and current players alike.
The room is more spacious while also featuring more natural light for those recovering from their injuries, with views all around Carrington.
United's improved medical facilities will be warmly welcomed, especially now that they have an MRI, CT and a full body scanner in their armoury.
The whole body scanner - the recent addition - can, in seven minutes, find out everything about a player's body composition.
With these extra and improved facilities, United also hope players who pick up any length of injuries will be more motivated to get back to full fitness at Carrington rather than carry out their rehabilitation abroad.
As we make our way upstairs, we pass the trophies of United's past, the Premier League, the Champions League, it goes on - a reminder of the past but also the aims for the future, no matter how close or distant.
We find ourselves in the new player's lounge and kitchen. On first view, it is pretty stunning. Bright and open - much look the redesigned Carrington, it is understandable why the players have been excited about this redevelopment.
On one side of the lounge, there are two rooms. One is a barbershop - where players can bring in their own to get their fresh cut, a footballer's necessity!
Next to that, a F1 simulator, which has gone down pretty well too.
As we continue on past the open floor office spaces, we see where Amorim and his staff are based. Just down the hall from Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell's recruitment team. With much of Old Trafford's staff relocating to the training ground in the coming months, there is a clear message here: the club want this to be a new chapter for United with it's heart in Carrington.
My personal favourite, for obvious reasons - a new press conference room! In the same building, the first team will be conducting most of their business - this slight change will make a shorter walk for Amorim to come through and answer the tough questions every week.
Although United have no European football to offer this season, this new room is UEFA compliant and could, as United hope, host future Champions League news conferences rather than having to constantly switch back to Old Trafford.

AC Milan keen to sign Man Utd striker Hojlund,AC Milan are keen to sign Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwy3klpp4x4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 19:10:13",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"AC Milan are keen to sign Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund.
It is just over a week since the Denmark forward made a point of speaking to journalists after he scored in a 4-1 friendly victory over Bournemouth in Chicago to state his intention to remain at Old Trafford, even if there was increased competition for his place in the Ruben Amorim's side.
However, United have since agreed terms with RB Leipzig for Slovenia international Benjamin Sesko, with the likelihood he will be introduced to the crowd at Old Trafford before Saturday's lunchtime friendly with Serie A outfit Fiorentina.
A number of clubs are thought to have expressed an interest in Hojlund, 23, in the knowledge United are willing to negotiate over his release.
It is understood Milan are keen, although they would only want a loan initially as they, like United, are hindered financially by an absence from European competition this season.
Sources suggest the Serie A side are willing to pay an initial 4m euros (£3.47m) loan fee, with an additional option to buy next summer for 40m (£34.7m).
Whether that is acceptable to United is open to doubt, although it is anticipated there will be more clarity on the situation in the coming week.
Milan open their Serie A campaign against Cremonese on 23 August.

"Rodri has had injury setback, says Guardiola","Manchester City's Rodri has suffered an injury setback and is unlikely to be ""really fit"" until September, says manager Pep Guardiola.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp8z6y7nj0zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 06:25:35",Mandeep Sanghera,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City midfielder Rodri has suffered an injury setback and is unlikely to be ""really fit"" until after the September international break, says manager Pep Guardiola.
The Spain international spent most of the 2024-25 season sidelined as a result of suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament injury last September.
The 2024 Ballon d'Or winner returned to action when he came on as a late substitute in City's penultimate Premier League game of last season against Bournemouth.
The 29-year-old was also part of Guardiola's squad at the Club World Cup in the United States during in the summer when City went out at the last-16 stage to Al-Hilal.
Rodri came on as a second-half substitute against the Saudi Arabian side but went off early in extra time with what is thought to have been a groin issue.
""Rodri is getting better but he had a big injury in the last game against Al-Hilal,"" said Guardiola.
""He has trained better in the last few days. Hopefully after the international break, he will be really fit.""
City open their Premier League campaign at Wolves on 16 August and then play Tottenham and Brighton before the September internationals.
""Hopefully in these games, he can play some minutes, but what is important is that he doesn't have pain because we don't want Rodri coming back injured. We will try desperately to avoid that,"" Guardiola added.
""He has been training the last two sessions with us and that's good.""

"Barber's, F1 and smart toilets - inside Man Utd's £50m Carrington upgrade",BBC Sport takes a look around Manchester United's training ground after its £50m upgrade.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3r49l74197o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 19:45:06",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"""On the ground floor there were no windows. It felt like you were in a hospital in the basement. It was a slightly gloomy place, a gloomy rabbit warren.""
Sir Jim Ratcliffe's first impressions of Carrington gave him no illusions as to what one of his first tasks should be if he succeeded in buying into Manchester United.
Two years on, Ratcliffe is describing those initial thoughts at the re-opening of the club's revamped training ground. He has invested £50m in the upgrades. The work took 12 months and was ""on time and within budget"".
""Manchester United is one of the most recognised brands in the world. The club has to compete at the highest level,"" he said. ""A world-class training facility won't take us to that position alone but one of the key ingredients is a modern facility. Now we have one.""
On Friday the media were invited in for a look. Let's start with the aspects you wouldn't expect.
In the corner of the players' canteen, now huge and, like most of the building, light and open-plan, is the familiar sight of a red, white and blue barber's pole.
United's squad was canvassed about what they wanted from a training ground. There were so many suggestions, in the end, Ratcliffe had to tell them to stop.
But a barber's area was included. The club doesn't supply the barber - players are responsible for bringing them in when needed. Trimmings of brown hair suggested it had been in use shortly before the media tour.
""Not to throw any names out but he's over there,"" laughed goalkeeper Tom Heaton pointing at defender Diogo Dalot.
""He would have been odds-on to have the first haircut.""
A barber in a training ground seems odd, but elite players often have their hair cut close to games. Having the availability of this on-site has the capacity to reduce stress.
Next to the barber's room is a slightly bigger area that houses a Formula 1 simulator. The player log suggested Mason Mount and Ayden Heaven were among those to take early advantage of that.
Sir Alex Ferguson started the formal proceedings of the official opening by unveiling a plaque to beloved former receptionist Kath Phipps in the entrance area that was her domain from Carrington first opening in 2000 until not long before her death in December 2024.
The legendary manager approved of the open-plan aspect of the players area as it encouraged interaction.
And this is one of the key components. Large open-plan areas with lots of natural light to create an uplifting environment.
Head coach Ruben Amorim has his own office but chief executive Omar Berrada does not, though one can swiftly be made available should it be required.
The boardroom has windows -but a heavy curtain should it be required when matters of importance and secrecy are being discussed. Coaches, analysts, recruitment staff, scouting and club leadership work in the same area to make the exchange of information easier.
The 'cinema' room where players are shown slides and replays as part of pre-match preparation and post-match debriefs has seats with Italian leather, ensuring they will be comfortable even on days when what they are watching is not.
On the ground floor - which now definitely looks like an elite sporting environment and not nearby Wythenshawe Hospital - staff sit in the 'Hub' looking out on the first team gym. They can measure data in real time and load it on to big screens next to a bank of bikes to advise players of their physical condition and performance.
If there is a Big Brother element to this, then what about 'smart urinals' which offer instant analysis around hydration.
In the first-team dressing room - which still has allocated spaces for the unwanted quartet of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Tyrrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho - each player has a touchscreen where individual messages can be sent by the coaches or sports science team and routines for the day can be outlined.
Next to that is a treatment room containing nine beds, with windows looking out on to the first-team training pitches. It could be argued a professional athlete watching colleagues do something they are prevented from being able to might not be ideal but the positives outweigh the negatives according to those who are paid to know such things.
There are MRI, CT and whole body scanners - an entire medical could be conducted at Carrington now, although there was no sign of impending new signing Benajmin Sesko on Friday.
There are four pools - one to swim in, a cold plunge, hot plunge and another with an underwater treadmill, the depth of which can be adjusted as required. The sauna and steam room in the same area have been made much bigger.
Between the gym and the pool area is a 'high altitude room' containing bikes and rowing machines in which the oxygen levels can be adjusted.
The first team go right when they walk though the players' entrance. Youngsters making the transition to the seniors go left, to their own dressing room, saving them from traipsing across from the academy building on the other side of the complex for training.
Not everything is quite complete.
The area housing temporary structures that last season were home to the women's team - who have returned to the building created for them now the men's first team don't need it - will be turned into a padel court. Four sleeping pods are due to be installed, while there will also be an area for red light therapy and also dry flotation tanks.
United want to encourage players to stay at the training ground longer. The days of arriving at 10 and leaving at 12 are long gone.
In his damning critique of his old club in 2022, Cristiano Ronaldo claimed United was ""stuck in time"" and ""nothing had changed"". It certainly has now.
Is this building Ronaldo's legacy, the legendary United and Real Madrid star's close friend and international colleague Dalot was asked?
""I'm sure he would love it if he was able to see it,"" he said.
""Overall, I think the message was clear, that this club deserved even more. All credit to Sir Jim and his team. They did a fantastic job.""

Chelsea hope to receive at least double the £32m they spent to sign the Senegal forward in 2023 from Villarreal.

Katie says watching Everton at home is a ""safe space"" for her son Harry.
In our house, Everton means football. My son is selectively mute and autistic so it's his safe space. No matter if we win, lose or draw Harry still calls the players his superheroes.
We sing all the Everton songs for seven hours on our way up to Liverpool and sometimes will be bouncing all the way back. Sometimes the car is very quiet on the way home.
Leaving Goodison is the right decision for Everton but personally it comes with a new set of challenges for my boy. But as long as his superheroes keep going, so will Harry.
Spurs - Lineker, Gazza and Italia '90
Tottenham Hotspur fan Mikey fell in love with Spurs after Italia '90.
As an eight-year-old after Italia '90 and the heroics of Lineker and Gazza, there was only one team for me.
That was cemented in 1991 by that Gazza semi-final [when he scored in a 3-1 win against Arsenal] and, sadly, the last time we won the FA Cup.
Despite all the lows and those 'Spursy' moments, my heart has never wavered. Banishing years of torment in May [by winning the Europa League] was pure joy.
Seeing grown men cry and children who could not remember the last trophy celebrate at the stadium will never leave me. My boys don't know what they're in for!
Liverpool - grandad's ashes buried under Kop
Carl shared the very personal connection his family has with Anfield.
Liverpool FC is in the blood - my DNA is in the ground.
Bill Shankly often spoke of there being one casket buried under the Kop - many ashes were scattered but only one casket buried. The ashes of my grandad, about a foot down in the goal in the Kop. Shankly would say the man under the Kop would head goals in and head them out, he referred to him as the invisible menace.
It's something I've been hugely proud of, to know my DNA is in that ground. My roots are part of one of the things that makes Liverpool special and unique.
My grandmother wrote to the club and Shankly replied personally. He was buried on a cold and frosty morning - his name was Henry Jones.
Manchester United  - generations of fans
Marilyn has been able to share a love for Manchester United with her family through four generations.
My dad was a lifelong supporter but died at the end of 1992, just before we won our first league title since 1967 (the year I was born). I was so gutted that he had waited so long and then missed it, but I started watching and taking an interest and basically got hooked.
Then my son got into football and he also supports Man Utd, which has been a great part of our bond over the years!
Through the good times and the not so good, I'll always support United. This photo is of me and my grandson, who is also a United fan.
Brighton - a love for mavericks
Brett expressed his love for Brighton mavericks such as Julio Enciso and 1970s midfielder Brian Bromley.
I first watched Brighton in the 1963-64 season, on the ""chicken run"" at the Goldstone Ground. My first professional game and my team forever.
What excites me is the maverick who gets you out of your seat and when possession-based football takes a rest for a split second and something magical happens.
The epitome of a maverick in Brighton colours is Julio Enciso and his goal of the season in 2022-23 against Manchester City was such a moment.
Another maverick from an entirely different era was Brian Bromley and the above letter from manager Pat Saward in 1972 is something I will always treasure.
The view from our reporters
BBC reporters Jonathan Buchan, Nizaar Kinsella and Mike Taylor shared their own stories about what makes them proud to support their clubs.
'A journey that links generations' - Jonathan Buchan
BBC Radio Leeds sports editor Buchan says he forced his dad, who wasn't a football fan, to take him and a friend on a half-mile walk from their home in Wortley to Elland Road:
""Personally, I owe a lot to that trip - a lifelong passion, friendships lasting decades... oh, and my entire career.
""Listening to the away games on BBC Radio Leeds ultimately resulted in me ending up in the role I find myself in today.""
Chelsea supporters 'relentless and demanding' - Nizaar Kinsella
BBC Sport football news reporter Kinsella spoke of the ""relentless and demanding"" fans he has come to be familiar with over a decade of covering Chelsea:
""Blues fans travel in great numbers.
""Some of the supporters I could highlight include Cathy, who has not missed an away match for 47 years, Terry, who relocated from Japan to London purely to be close to the club, and Basil, described as a Chelsea Women superfan on the club's own website - and one you can hear chanting loudly at Kingsmeadow matches.
""It is these people that make a matchday and enrich my role covering the club.""
Wolves fans are 'a community' - Mike Taylor
BBC Radio WM reporter Taylor praised the collective spirit at Molineux.
""Listening on the concourses, you are reminded that football clubs are so much more than scores and numbers.
""They are a community, drawn apparently at random from all classes and generations, united by one devotion.
""Like all relationships, it goes through times of strain - and faith can be tested - but the love remains.""

Burnley sign Broja from Chelsea,Burnley complete the signing of Armando Broja from Chelsea for an undisclosed fee believed to be worth up to £20m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy0qj00j1jro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 16:17:31",Steve Sutcliffe,['Chelsea'],"Burnley have completed the signing of Armando Broja from Chelsea for an undisclosed fee believed to be worth up to £20m.
The Albania international striker has agreed a five-year contract at Turf Moor and becomes the second player this week to make the move from Stamford Bridge with Lesley Ugochukwu, also having made the switch to Lancashire.
""It's a really positive time to be joining this club ahead of the start of the new Premier League season. I can't wait to get going,"" said Broja.
""I'm feeling good, I'm ready and I'm excited about the challenge of playing for this club.
""I can already feel the support from the Burnley fans. I can tell you all that I will be giving my all every time I pull on the famous Claret shirt.""
The 23-year-old first played for Chelsea in 2020 and made 38 appearances for the Blues in all competitions.
However, he struggled for regular first-team football and has spent time on loan at Vitesse Arnhem, Southampton, Fulham and Everton in recent seasons.
Broja becomes Burnley's ninth signing of the summer and joins the Clarets squad prior to this weekend's home friendly against Lazio.
Scott Parker's side begin their Premier League campaign on Saturday, 16 August when they travel to Tottenham (15:00 BST).

‘We fought to achieve our dreams’: Fabinho on Diogo Jota and leaving Liverpool,Midfielder’s outlook on life has changed since the death of his former Anfield teammate in a tragic accident,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/09/fabinho-diogo-jota-liverpool-football-al-ittihad,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 07:00:49",Thiago Rabelo,['Liverpool'],"Fabinho attended Diogo Jota’s funeral unable to believe it was all true. His Portuguese friend, with whom he played for three years at Liverpool, had died in a tragic accident alongside André Silva, his brother. The Brazilian found himself reflecting extensively on life and how everything can be lost in a fleeting moment.
“It was very difficult to absorb because he had a routine and a life just like mine,” Fabinho says. “When that happens, you put yourself in that situation. We’ve lived through a period together. We fought to achieve our dreams. Professional dreams, but personal dreams too. We had a lot in common. And then you think about it. There’s no way round it. It makes you think that life is but a breath.”
Fabinho is talking from Spain, preparing with Al-Ittihad for his third season in the Saudi Pro League. Since joining the Portuguese club Rio Ave at the age of 18, he has lived outside Brazil. Over the following 13 years, he has become accustomed to the rhythms of travelling and working in football, but Jota’s death has changed his outlook.
“Whether you like it or not, you start to appreciate the details of your life,” he says. “I’m a guy who tries to make the most of the life I have with my family. I’m very grateful to God. But when something like this happens, you start to value even more what really matters.”
At Liverpool Fabinho enjoyed the most successful years of his career. He won the Champions League in his first campaign and was again a key player the following season as the club secured a first top-flight title in 30 years. Leaving in 2023 was not easy.
“Liverpool is a sensational club that helps us with everything,” he says. “Not just on the pitch but in your life too. Everything they’ve done for me and my family has been spectacular; I’ve never seen anything like it. Everywhere you go, not only in England, the supporters show a lot of love for the club and the players.”
Fabinho’s departure surprised many. First, because of his perceived importance: he made 219 appearances in five years, almost always as a first choice. Second, because it was not common for high-profile players to leave the Premier League for Saudi Arabia. He details, for the first time, what influenced his decision.
“I didn’t want to leave the club and go to any other club in Europe,” he says. “I thought it was the best place in the world to play, to keep developing as a player. I wanted my legacy and my history at the club to grow even more but our last season was very gruelling, tiring. We didn’t do well and failed to qualify for the Champions League. I lost my position as a starter for a few games, but that happens.
“I came back for the following season, even though the previous one hadn’t been good, with a very good mentality and wanting to fight for the Premier League title again. But before the season started, Al-Ittihad made an offer for me and the Liverpool directors said it was very good for the club and for me. I was afraid and decided to wait to see what [the coaching staff] would say. I thought I was an important player and that they would refuse any offer, but I realised that the club was open to selling me.”
Fabinho next asked Jürgen Klopp for his thoughts. The manager was a huge admirer, to the point that he had described Fabinho as one of the best No 6s in the world and criticised Tite for rarely using him for Brazil. The conversation they had came as a disappointment.
“He called me and asked me what I wanted,” Fabinho says. “I said that I’d heard the offer and liked it but that I wanted to hear from him what he thought. He said that if there are any players who want to leave, he won’t hold them back. It was a speech that kind of opened the door for me to leave. That conversation with the coach could have kept me at the club but he left it open and I didn’t like it very much. I always like to do a prayer before I make my decisions. Liverpool is a club I love but the things that happened at the time steered my life towards Arabia. I left in peace and happy with my decision.”
At Al-Ittihad, Fabinho has not lost his golden touch. In May a player who helped Monaco to a first league win in 17 years and was part of Liverpool’s long-awaited Premier League triumph celebrated the title with the Jeddah-based club, coached by Laurent Blanc. He last played for Brazil in December 2022 but dreams of a call-up from Carlo Ancelotti.
“My goal is to play in the [2026] World Cup,” the 31-year-old says. “I’m working towards it. I performed very well last season. That made me very happy and I was able to show myself that I still have a lot of quality and that I can help the Brazilian national team.”
Fabinho is also looking to the future and thinking about coaching. “I’m starting to take a more boring view of football. Boring isn’t the word; I think it’s more demanding. When you want to win, you have to be more demanding. I’m very demanding, I’ve had a lot of experience in my career and what has always helped me is my tactical vision and my game reading.
“It’s something I enjoy. I like watching games, observing and studying. I don’t know if this will make me a coach, but it’s something I really like and want to work on. I’m going to do a course to become a coach. I started to study it when I was at Liverpool but I didn’t finish. I’m going to prepare for that. Whether or not I go on [to coach professionally], that’s another story.”
He has role models to draw from if it comes to it. Despite not liking that chat with Klopp, the German remains his inspiration. “I really like Klopp’s idea, with his style that many people say is like rock’n’roll. It’s the style I’ve most enjoyed playing and watching. I have always been impressed by Tite as well. His set pieces are very good, he’s a coach who works a lot on the details. Today, with Blanc, I like the relationship he has with the players. He knows how to manage a team. But when people ask me who is my best coach I already had, I always say the coach I’ve won the most with. And that’s Klopp.”
Fabinho has a year on his contract and extending that deal is among the possibilities under consideration. “I’m happy at Al-Ittihad, I really like here,” he says. “The Brazilian league is also an option – it is getting stronger and stronger – but I also want to go back to Europe. I want to play and fight for another Champions League title. The Premier League is still the best league in the world, but I think I’d prioritise another country that I haven’t had the chance to play in yet.”

Downbeat Howe ‘doesn’t know what future holds’ for Isak at Newcastle,Manager admits his team have been disrupted by the transfer saga and ‘it’s not straightforward’ to insist striker honours his contract,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/08/downbeat-howe-doesnt-know-what-future-holds-for-isak-at-newcastle,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 22:50:50",Louise Taylor,['Liverpool'],"Alexander Isak’s old poster-boy image has been removed from the plateglass windows of Newcastle’s club store and, judging by Eddie Howe’s demeanour on Friday night, the Sweden striker could soon be erased from the attacking roll call.
Isak, currently engaged in a standoff with the club as he tries to force a move to Liverpool, was nowhere to be seen as Newcastle drew 2-2 with Espanyol in a St James’ Park friendly. Not that his absence prevented the night’s subtext being all about the man who was not there.
Afterwards Howe admitted he “does not know what the future holds” for Isak after revealing he will continue to train in isolation next week. “We’ve had discussions and it’s clear we can’t involve him in the group at the moment,” said Newcastle’s manager. “I don’t know how long that will last. He is training later than the rest of the squad.
“From our perspective we’d like to see him back with the team but the situation has to be right for the team. He’s contracted to us so, of course, there’s a chance he could play for Newcastle again. But I don’t know what the future holds.”
Given Newcastle’s continuing struggles to sign a replacement, Howe was asked if he could simply insist that a player who swerved the club’s pre-season tour of Singapore and South Korea should honour his deal but the manager, who said he did not think the board had yet disciplined the 25-year-old, demurred. “It’s not that straightforward,” he said. “We’d have done that if we could but we’re not currently in a position to do that.
“The team has, of course, been disrupted by this. But that doesn’t mean we can’t overcome this and come back even stronger.”
The sight of more than 20,000 empty seats on Friday night at a customarily full arena will alarm Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian ownership but the sparse crowd was arguably more about Howe saving most of his first XI for Saturday afternoon’s second La Liga friendly against Atlético Madrid than an outright mutiny at an admittedly dismal transfer window before a Champions League campaign.
In Isak’s absence, and with his fellow striker Callum Wilson having moved to West Ham, the endearingly enthusiastic but hugely inexperienced Will Osula led the attacking line as Newcastle, with the outstanding Lewis Miley looking like an England central midfielder in the making, were left without a victory in this troubled pre-season.
With a decent striker on the pitch they would arguably have won. The only problem is that the entire No 9 species seem to have developed an allergy to Tyneside. Bryan Mbeumo, João Pedro, Liam Delap and Benjamin Sesko rank among those forwards who have turned Newcastle down and the St James’ Park board will not countenance selling Isak to Anfield for a sum well in excess of £110m until two new attacking faces are secured.
With the transfer window’s closure fast approaching it is all turning into a race against the clock, not to mention a game of who blinks first. Despite excluding Isak from a training ground barbecue last week in the wake of the striker’s unsanctioned trip to train alone at his old club Real Sociedad, Howe still does not know where the striker who scored 27 goals for him last season will be playing when Liverpool visit on this month’s bank holiday Monday.
Despite, albeit weakening, protestations to the contrary, Howe’s demeanour suggested he feels he and his dressing room would be infinitely better off without a player who has evidently checked out, mentally at least, from Tyneside. It would surely be much better to reinvest Liverpool’s fee on some decent new players – the Coventry midfielder Jack Rudoni anyone? – and create a new hero or two.
Although a good-humoured, family-dominated crowd of just over 30,000 was not exactly typical of the more vehemently partisan Premier League crew, there is a sense that many Newcastle fans have already loosened the emotional ties that until very recently bound them tightly to Isak. Granted they feel more than a little let down but there is a mood of almost shrugging acceptance that Liverpool have turned his head and they will never again sing their former Abba-pastiche anthem, Gimme, Gimme a Striker from Sweden.
Should Yoane Wissa, Ollie Watkins, Nicolas Jackson – (not that Newcastle fans seem overly keen on him) – Jørgen Strand Larsen, Samu Aghehowa, Gonçalo Ramos or any other potential attacking recruits start scoring regularly it will surely be a case of “the king is dead, long live the king”.
In any case, Howe already has a Targett on his side. Matt, a veteran full-back, operating on the left of a midfield three, discovered his latent Isak streak as he met Miley’s cross to head Newcastle level after Edu Expósito has expertly half-volleyed Espanyol into the lead. After that Newcastle’s impressive debutant in goal, the Southampton loanee Aaron Ramsdale, saved Javi Puado’s penalty before Murphy’s goal preceded Kike García’s deserved leveller.
There is evidently much work to be done on Tyneside before next weekend’s Premier League opener at Aston Villa. “The balance of our squad isn’t quite right,” said Howe. “But I’m hopeful we can adjust that in the next couple of weeks.”

Community Shield brings hopes and fears but also an end to summer of civility,"After marvelling at Lionesses, Lions, Alcaraz and McIlroy, attention returns to English football and its cynicism",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/09/football-return-community-shield-hopes-and-fears-marks-end-of-summer-of-civility,"Sat, 09 Aug 2025 07:00:48",John Brewin,['Chelsea'],"The Community Shield marks beginnings and ends. Here come nine months of Premier League hopes and fears. Even if the eventual fate awaiting a team can become crystal clear as early as the opening weekend, there can be no backward glances. This means more, as the modern cliche goes. Many are happy to live by those words.
Regrettably, club football’s return also means the sun setting on a brilliant summer of sport, the closing of an ever-narrower window. Only the truly afflicted are not glad of the respite. The close season, as it was previously termed, lowers the cortisol, regulates the serotonin levels until it’s time to go again. The Club World Cup was not too much of a diversion, despite Gianni Infantino’s best efforts and corralling of Donald Trump, a month of unlovable fare that desperately searched for authenticity via its blaring, high-contrast cocktail of celebrity and Saudi Arabian money.
England’s modern-classic 25-day Test series with India, a British & Irish Lions rugby union tour to restore faith in the tradition, the emotions of Rory McIlroy’s Royal Portrush homecoming at the Open, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz playing out two thrilling grand slam tennis finals, both male and female versions of the Tour de France and, most of all, the rollercoaster ride the Lionesses took England on to defend their Euros crown. All have offered welcome relief from the Premier League’s self-important yet irresistible charms.
Each featured sport played at ultra-competitive levels, with plenty of needle around. England’s fielders attempted to distract their opponents with a circular set of sledges that often recalled the incantations from the Wicker Man. Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard eyed each other’s moves in the high mountains in predatory fashion, each trying to bury the other, but by Paris their admiration for each other was also made plain. Similar respect filled the air in the clinches shared between teams after India levelled at the Oval, and in Sydney as Australia signed off with a deserved consolation victory.
The spirit of cricket endures. This summer South Africa’s captain, Wiaan Mulder, declared his team’s innings with him on 367 not out against Zimbabwe, 33 short of the highest Test score, reasoning that “Brian Lara keeping that record is exactly the way it should be”, and showing clemency to a redeveloping opponent.
Where Wisden quoted a number of responses bemoaning “woke nonsense” and the like, Mulder’s gesture spoke to sportsmanship, legacy and a respect for his sport’s purity. The following weekend, the final of Infantino’s plaything ended in an on-pitch skirmish between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain players and Trump gatecrashing the celebrations.
So back into the football void we go, where “Respect” is a long-forgotten Football Association campaign, where video assistant referees mean the on-pitch official’s decision is less than final, where fans now pore over rivals’ published accounts in search of profitability and sustainability breaches. Such are the terms of engagement of the Premier League.
As a less modern cliche has it, Sunday’s the meeting of Liverpool and Crystal Palace is a traditional curtain-raiser, while also drawing the curtain on everything else. Though certain managers, Pep Guardiola among them, count it as a major trophy, it retains a status of glorified friendly, though it has often reflected the cynicism of the season ahead.
Its most famous match, when it was the Charity Shield, remains the first staging at Wembley in 1974, Liverpool’s Kevin Keegan and Leeds’ Billy Bremner dismissed for throwing punches. Leeds’ Johnny Giles has admitted his role as Keegan’s provocateur, saying in 2020: “He was in a bit of a temper … I actually did hit him.” The two miscreants, but not Giles, were banned for 11 matches each, among their chief offences being the ungentlemanly discarding of shirts as they left the field, these days common practice for the dismissed.
More recently, in the old Wembley’s last staging of the event, in 2000, Manchester United’s Roy Keane was sent off for a brutal studs-up clatter of Gustavo Poyet, reviving a personal feud begun in the same fixture three years earlier. Another serious casting of shade was at Villa Park in August 2012, Wembley in use for the London Olympics. London’s 16 days as the centre of the sporting universe, with its Super Saturday, a host rapt by the prospect of Team GB winning medals in even the most obscure sports, had reached its closing Sunday. Mo Farah had won double gold the previous night.
Enter Chelsea and Manchester City, whose grasping of the spirit of London 2012, sportsmanship bringing all together, was to kick blessed lumps from each other, the referee Kevin Friend all but losing control, Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic dismissed for a studs-up challenge on his Serbian compatriot Aleksandar Kolarov’s shin. Eight yellow cards were waved. Three years later, back at Wembley, Arsène Wenger and José Mourinho shunned each other in theatrical fashion rather than shake hands.
Scenes you won’t want to see … but actually really want to see? That Premier League football is played at the edge of sanity and acceptability is a leading reason why it holds the attention through the dark winter it beckons.

‘No excuses’: Manchester United admit new £50m training hub must spark success,New centre includes F1 simulation room and padel court,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/08/no-excuses-manchester-united-admit-new-50m-training-hub-must-spark-success,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 18:18:25",Will Unwin,['Manchester United'],"Diogo Dalot says there will be “no excuses” if Manchester United do not succeed after the opening of a new £50m training facility.
The minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe cut the ribbon on the building for the men’s team at Carrington after Sir Alex Ferguson unveiled a plaque to the long-serving club receptionist Kath Phipps, who died last year. Ratcliffe said the renovations were befitting of a club with ambitions to be one of the best in Europe, as he continues his plan to return United to previous heights.
Dalot said: “The big thing that I like the most is now there’s going to be no excuses. Ultimately, the thing that will define us is what we do on the pitch. I think what is going to bring joy to the fans, joy to ourselves is winning games. We’re getting all the conditions to put us in the best position to win. And then we just have to make that final step.”
The full squad attended the ceremony alongside the coaching staff, the chief executive, Omar Berrada, and the director of football, Jason Wilcox. The former chief executive David Gill and former captain Bryan Robson, a club ambassador, were among the dignitaries to attend.
“We are delighted with the outcome and are confident the new facility will play an important role in building a winning culture at the club,” Ratcliffe said.
United moved to Carrington from The Cliff at the turn of the century and had consistently adapted the site but created a disjointed layout. The comprehensive renovation, designed by Foster + Partners, aims to correct that. There is an emphasis on the flow of a player’s journey through the building, natural light plays a key role in what was previously a dark interior and additional communal spaces have been created to help players socialise. “Equipment and technology have been upgraded throughout, with a focus on fitness, nutrition, recovery and team unity,” United said.
After Cristiano Ronaldo returned to United in 2021 he lamented the lack of change at Carrington in the 12 years since he had left, saying it “stopped in time”.
It was accepted within the club that the training ground had fallen behind those of Premier League rivals and Ratcliffe identified it as an area to improve. It was prioritised as part of his £237.6m investment in infrastructure.
There is a barber’s shop on site, which the goalkeeper Tom Heaton suggested would be most frequently visited by Dalot, a Formula One simulation room and a padel court, a construction the players insisted on.
It is anticipated players will spend longer at the training ground than in previous years and it is designed to be more accommodating of the modern footballer’s requirements. An expanded first-team changing room and improved canteen have been installed. Sleep pods and dry floating tanks for relaxation are due to follow.
Medical and rehabilitation facilities have been revamped with a view to matching the elite amenities at other sporting organisations. A basement was dug to allow for recovery pools and there is a new altitude training room.
The men’s team going in will allow the women’s side to return to their facilities. They were moved out into temporary structures while the ­building work took place over the past 12 months, so the men could have the best of what was available.
“We’ve all been blown away by the opportunity this is going to provide in terms of a world-class facility,” said Heaton, who first trained at the site in the early 2000s in the academy. “Of course people make a building, players on the pitch bring performances and bring results, but in terms of what that [the new facilities] can give you, in terms of providing help and stability for that performance, I think everyone’s excited.”

Ethan Nwaneri targets bigger role with Arsenal after signing long-term deal,"Forward, 18, agrees five-year contract with Gunners",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/08/where-i-feel-at-home-ethan-nwaneri-signs-new-deal-to-stay-at-arsenal,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 17:17:10",Ed Aarons,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Ethan Nwaneri has said he feels at home at Arsenal after signing a new long-term deal and is determined to build on his breakthrough season. It is understood Nwaneri, the youngest Premier League debutant after playing for Arsenal aged 15 years and 181 days in 2022, has signed a five-year deal despite interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany.
The 18-year-old was the youngest member of England’s victorious squad at this summer’s European Under-21 Championship and has made 39 appearances for Arsenal, scoring nine goals. In January he became only the third player, after Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney, to score three Premier League goals before his 18th birthday.
Premier League regulations meant he had been using a separate changing room to the rest of Arsenal’s ­senior players until turning 18 in March and Nwaneri said on Friday he was ­looking forward to a bigger role at the club he joined as an eight-year-old.
“Signing this contract means every­thing to me,” he said. “I see this as my first real season in men’s senior football, as part of the squad in the changing room.
“I’m so excited for what I can bring to the team. I want to help us win as much as possible and bring happiness and glory to the club. This is where I feel at home. I think I’ve actually become more direct over the past few years and I’ve added more goals, so I’m excited for what will come next.”
Along with Myles Lewis-Skelly, who also signed a new long-term Arsenal contract this summer after breaking into the first team and ­making his senior England debut last season, Nwaneri is regarded as one of the best young prospects to have emerged from Arsenal’s Hale End academy in recent years.
Max Dowman has been tipped to follow in their footsteps and the 15-year-old was praised by Mikel Arteta after Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat by Villarreal in a pre-season friendly on Wednesday, when Nwaneri started in midfield.
“He continues to impress, without a doubt,” the manager said of ­Dowman. “The impact he had in the game again, the efficiency that he shows in every attack and action, it’s incredible. He deserves to have chances, and if he continues like this, let’s see what happens.” ­Arsenal start their season away against ­Manchester United on 17 August.

Wrexham return to the second tier for the first time in 43 years. Three consecutive promotions have taken the Red Dragons – the Welsh club with Hollywood backing and an unlikely global following – from the National League to an opening-day fixture at Southampton, freshly relegated from the Premier League. While some fans have been dreaming that Wrexham can make it four promotions in succession there is the danger that, after such a rapid rise, they find their ceiling – the jump from League One to the Championship is bigger than those they have bridged in the past couple of years. Ben Fisher reports from St Mary’s.
The noise around United never ceases and Ruben Amorin’s outlay on players to refresh a team that struggled so glaringly in the Premier League last season has kept them at the forefront of the transfer agenda over the summer. So for United’s final warm-up match, plenty of attention will be on his new signings, the boyhood supporter Bryan Mbeumo among them. Mbeumo was handed the chance to fulfil a dream with a £70m switch from Brentford. Amorim will hope the 25-year-old Cameroon forward adds pace, creativity and goals – he scored 20 in the league last season – as he attempts to improve upon last campaign’s desperately disappointing 15th-place finish. Will Unwin reports.
Next up in our coverage of the opening Championship weekend are another Welsh club with North American connections. Comparisons with Wrexham, who are owned by the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, have been unavoidable since the 53-year-old American rapper Snoop Dogg joined a growing list of celebrity investors in British football last month by becoming part of a Swansea ownership group that already included the Croatia midfield great Luka Modric. Snoop said Swansea’s “underdog” story “really struck a chord with me” and his vast following on social media – 89 million on Instagram and 20.5 million on X – quickly learned about the Welsh club and his love for Joe’s ice-cream in the city. A docu-series tracking life at Swansea, on similar lines to the Welcome to Wrexham, is understood to be already in the pipeline. Louise Taylor reports.
England’s final warm-up match before the Women’s Rugby World Cup takes John Mitchell’s side to the Stade Guy Boniface to take on old foes France, but again without the experienced Emily Scarratt, Claudia Moloney-MacDonald and Holly Aitchison. Also absent will be Marlie Packer following last weekend’s red card against Spain. Packer sparked fears about her availability for the first fixture of England’s home World Cup against the USA on 22 August after she was sent off in a 97-7 win for a clumsy clearout. A two-week suspension would have ruled the former Red Roses captain out of the opener at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light, but she will miss only this fixture after World Rugby handed out a one-match ban. Raphaël Jucobin reports from Mont-de-Marsan.
Tumaini Carayol reports on Emma Raducanu’s preparations for the US Open, the tournament she won in 2021, at the Cincinnati Open, where she received a bye in the first round and will face Olga Danilovic. The Briton’s form of late has been encouraging. She followed a round-three exit to Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon with a semi-final showing at the Citi Open in Washington, where she was eventually beaten by Anna Kalinskaya. The US Open begins later in August and Raducanu is improving under the guidance of Rafael Nadal’s former coach Francis Roig. “I’m working on the quality of my shots to be better,” she says. “I think against the very top that’s what it needs, it needs to improve.”

Arne Slot is relishing the challenge of facing Crystal Palace, the FA Cup winners, at Wembley, as the Premier League champions aim to begin the new season with silverware and prepare for their title defence. Liverpool are chasing a 17th Community Shield title, with their latest coming in 2022, but their last trip to Wembley ended in a surprise 2-1 League Cup final defeat by Newcastle in March. “It’s nice if you can start the season by winning something. We have a chance at the beginning of the season. We face a difficult Crystal Palace side. They have shown how hard it is to win a one-off game with them,” Slot says. “Palace hit the ground running again, it is still the same team. A good challenge for us to start the season.” Rob Smyth is your minute-by-minute host, while Ed Aarons and John Brewin report from Wembley.
In a turbulent past few months Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with several EFL-imposed embargoes for financial breaches, including failing to pay players and staff on time in May, June and July. That led to the 15 first-team players still on the books at the club to boycott a behind-closed-doors friendly against Burnley, which came to light on the same day Henrik Pedersen was announced as manager. The Dane is certain there will be no repeat in their Championship opener at Leicester. “I think I have a really good relationship with the players. I’m convinced we have a group who are really looking forward to Sunday’s game and will do everything they can for our club,” he says. Daniel Harris helms our live blog, with Billy Munday reporting from the King Power Stadium.

‘The attitude is despair’: Sheffield Wednesday fans push for end to Chansiri’s reign,Protests and a flyover will mark first game of season for 158-year-old club struggling to pay or recruit players,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/08/attitude-is-despair-sheffield-wednesday-fans-wish-for-end-to-chansiris-reign,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:47:34",Will Unwin,"['Arsenal', 'Liverpool', 'Manchester City']","There is little like the anticipation of a new season, not knowing what will come, optimistic this could be your club’s year. Sheffield Wednesday fans have sold out the away end at Leicester on Sunday to watch their team take on a club recently mixing it with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City in the Premier League. The excitement should be building at Hillsborough but instead there is only worry and anger.
It has been a summer of discontent at Wednesday, although the problems began years ago, and the only thing for supporters to cling to is that it may end Dejphon Chansiri’s reign. Those at the King Power Stadium are due to show their disdain for the ownership by leaving their seats empty for the first five minutes and covering the area with a large anti-Chansiri banner. A plane is scheduled to fly overhead with a further message aimed at the owner.
“The attitude among the fans at the minute is despair,” says Ian Bennett, the chair of the supporters’ trust. “In the short term, surviving is the biggest thing and I think it’s going to be a problem. We’re not going to be competitive at all. I think it’s just going to be an absolute nightmare and we’re very concerned about the future of the club.”
It is not the first protest against Chansiri and the reasons for complaints are so plentiful it would take a book to explain. To concentrate on some of the most recent elements, employees did not receive their full wages in June and July, leading Josh Windass and Michael Smith to hand in their notice and depart for nothing; the prized asset Djeidi Gassama was sold to Rangers for £2.2m – far below his market value – to belatedly fund June’s salary shortfall; there are 16 first-team players on the books, including a solitary goalkeeper; the club are under a transfer embargo until 2027, which stipulates they cannot pay fees; and Danny Röhl, the highly rated head coach, has departed.
Players took a stand by backing out of a friendly against Burnley and released a statement demanding a resolution. A strike has been mooted but the focus is to prepare as best they can for competitive fixtures for the sake of supporters under a head coach, Henrik Pedersen, who is aiming to bring tranquility amid the chaos. He took time to watch a staff member play padel this week. Even Pedersen, however, was uncertain on Thursday whether the captain, Barry Bannan, could be registered to feature on Sunday after signing a new contract. Money received this week via Premier League solidarity payments allowed wages to be paid on Friday, lifting certain embargo restrictions and enabling the club to sign players on free transfers and register Bannan, but the long-term picture is beyond precarious.
Players have been on trial, experienced unattached players such as Ben Mee and Liam Cooper have been offered to the Owls, and the club are scouring the loan market to strengthen depth. One player who has trained and was wanted by Pedersen did not meet work permit requirements.
The supporters’ trust created a fund for club employees to access if facing financial struggles. In a further sign of Wednesday’s problems the North Stand, which is emblazoned with Chansiri’s name and holds 9,000 supporters, many of whom are season-ticket holders, has been closed by the council. Work needs to be carried out on the roof to make it safe and the club say they “remain hopeful” of having it open for Stoke’s visit next Saturday in the first home match.
Chansiri says he is willing to sell, but has dismissed at least two bids because he is seeking £100m, regarded by many interested parties as far too much. Given the circumstances, optimism – or possibly desperation – abounds that the tuna magnate will lower his demands. “There’s a massive opportunity for somebody to take this club by the scruff of the neck and make a lot of money,” says Bennett.
One potential bidder is John Textor but his recent off-field record at Lyon, including substantial debts and a Uefa fine for a breach of financial sustainability requirements, makes many supporters uneasy. The American has been open about his desire to buy an English club and is keeping an eye on Wednesday after selling his shares in Crystal Palace.
It is likely the fans’ pressure on Chansiri will be ramped up at the first home game. More protests will take place as supporters aim to get the widest audience to highlight their plight. Chansiri will not be present, wisely keeping his distance. “The fans are determined to keep following the club and the motto is: ‘Support the team, not the regime,’” says Bennett.
The EFL eventually found reason to disqualify Dai Yongge from owning Reading, forcing him to sell. There are no such circumstances or wrongdoing in relation to Chansiri, so supporters are reliant on his leaving willingly.
There is fear among fans that 158 years of history could be about to go up in smoke and the message from Bennett to Chansiri is clear: “Please – with some dignity – leave and don’t be forced out, and just give the supporters a chance to support a competitive football club. You say you are all about family. We are a big family, show us some respect for that.”

GO
With six new teams, 11 new managers and one storied old club reduced to such levels of penury by a pernicious owner that one of its unpaid suppliers have reportedly refused to provide sock-tape for its belatedly-paid players, the new Championship campaign kicks off on Friday night, with fancied sides Birmingham and Ipswich ready to get the first of the regular season’s 552 games started. Of course there could end up being considerably fewer if Sheffield Wednesday owner Dejphon Chansiri doesn’t do the decent thing and sell up for a price that isn’t totally outlandish, but for now the Owls remain hopeful of fielding a team for their season-opener at relegated returnees Leicester on Sunday, even if whatever side they can cobble together is forced to show more leg than is considered appropriate or decent on a football pitch. As things stand, Wednesday fans would almost certainly be delighted if their club lives up to its status as hotter-than-the-sun favourites to finish bottom of the league come season’s end, because it would at least mean they still have one to support.
A white-knuckle ride so unpredictable that … erm, five of the past six pre-season favourites have gone on to win it, the Championship still remains one of football’s more exciting leagues in so far as anyone in it can beat anyone else without it registering particularly high on the Richter scale. An ongoing soap opera with no ends of overlapping and intertwined narrative arcs and characters, this season will boast no end of intriguing interlopers in the form of Wrexham custodians/opportunists Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, Snoop Dogg sidling into the Swansea City hood and the Birmingham minority owner, documentary star and charisma vacuum that is Tom Brady.
To act as a counterbalance to these intriguing sprinklings of stardust, of course there are more meat-and-potatoes sides of the kind personified by Preston. A team who took so much umbrage at a recent Big Website suggestion that their unremarkable, ongoing and reassuring presence in the second tier is to be highly commended, they failed to win any of their final eight games and only stayed up on the final day by the skin of their teeth. One imagines a mid-table finish will do just fine this time around, although they may struggle again.
While the likes of Hull, Oxford, Charlton and Portsmouth are also likely to be in the scramble to avoid having to mix it down among the dead men, Luton’s surprise second consecutive relegation last season proved nobody can rest on their laurels. Having had a full pre-season to get his ducks in a row ahead of his first full campaign as Coventry manager, Frank Lampard’s fortunes seem like the kind that could veer either way and his many cheerleaders and detractors will inevitably be keeping a close eye on the table to see which half his side occupy. Following last season’s playoff failure he’ll be hoping his troops pull their socks up in time for Saturday’s opener against Hull and hoping that, unlike those of a certain other team, they don’t immediately fall down.

QUOTE OF THE DAY
“The Spanish keeper had [the research] on her bottle. So I thought when she went in goal, ‘just chuck it into the English fans’. Then she can’t have it! I wouldn’t put it on a bottle because anyone could do that. I put it on my arm. It wasn’t hard, when she’s gone in the goal it’s on its own, isn’t it? You just pick it up. She realised when she saw my bottle in there instead. She was walking back and looked so confused and I was trying not to burst out laughing” – Hannah Hampton, Ballon d’Or nominee, reveals how she befuddled Spain’s Cata Coll to gain an edge for the Lionesses during the Euro 2025 final penalty shootout.
FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS
I was somewhat surprised to read your comment that Arsenal had ‘won the square root of nish-all in five years’ (yesterday’s Football Daily). May I join 1,056 other pedants in recalling the supreme glory of the men’s team in securing the Community Shield twice in that strict timespan (2020 and 2023). Also we must surely spotlight the even greater successes of the Arsenal women’s team in winning the League Cup – twice (2022-23 and 2023-24) - and Bigger Cup (2024-25)” – Nick Howarth Pulleyn (and no others).
Let’s face it; Arsenal will stop Arsenal being champions. When William Blake wrote of ‘mind-forg’d manacles’ and the ‘marks of weakness [in every face I meet]’, in the poem London, he was specifically referring to the area between Drayton Park and Tollington Road” – Rowan Sweeney.
What a wonderful, heartfelt paean to Son Heung-min from Michael Gilsenan (yesterday’s Football Daily letters). Can I suggest that Michael offers his services to Son as a scriptwriter? He’d surely have come up with a more enthusiastic tribute to LA than Son’s own half-baked effort (and, on reflection, awarding it that is probably being over-generous)” – Phil Taverner.
As the Sonny appreciation society goes into overload, did you know that Harry Kane played played 435 games for Spurs, scoring 280 goals? While Sonny played 454 games for Spurs, scoring 173? But Kane slotted in 63 penalties. Now, had Son been taking those same penalties instead, you can do the math (as they say). Simply amazing. What a guy” – Marc Meldrum.
We often think about players joining new clubs and whether they’ll fit in, or will they suit their new surroundings. I see Anthony Stokes has joined Conor McGregor’s Black Forge FC” – Gareth Aherne.

Football transfer rumours: Milan move for Højlund? Spurs target Paz?,Today’s rumours are preparing for a conversation,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/08/football-transfer-rumours-milan-move-for-hojlund-spurs-target-paz,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 09:13:32",Taha Hashim,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United', 'Liverpool', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Farewell, Benjamin Sesko. The Slovene has been churned through the Mill but is finally moving past the tittle-tattle to something more concrete. He’s on the way to Manchester United, such a great, welcoming place in recent years for developing forwards. Godspeed. What does this mean for Newcastle, who were in for him too and are in dire need of anyone, anyone, to walk through the door? They continue to be linked with Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson and Brentford’s Yoane Wissa, while the Daily Mail says Wolves’ Jørgen Strand Larsen is in their thoughts, too.
Uncertainty lingers over their prized possession, Alexander Isak, denied the joys of the grill but, claims the Times, still desired by Liverpool – even after their £110m offer was rejected. With Sesko the new leading man at Old Trafford, Rasmus Højlund’s future comes into question; Milan could be the answer, potentially taking the former Atalanta striker back to Serie A. Chelsea are developing a habit for United wingers: Jadon Sancho on loan last year, Alejandro Garnacho this time round, with perhaps more permanence. The Argentinian international has apparently been given a price tag of £50m.
Bournemouth have had their impressive backline picked apart by the big boys. Illia Zabarnyi finds himself on the way to Paris Saint-Germain after the departures of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool, as well as the end of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan. But the French connection goes both ways. Lille’s Bafodé Diakité is getting lined up for a move to the south coast. Bournemouth are also having to deal with interest in their forward line; Dango Ouattara has reportedly caught the attention of Brentford after seven goals and four assists in the league last season. Tottenham, shorn of the services of James Maddison for the near future after his anterior cruciate ligament injury, are said to like the look of the Como midfielder Nico Paz, though the Cesc Fàbregas-run outfit like him exactly where he is.
Ademola Lookman has made clear he wants out of Atalanta after “many months of broken promises”, with Inter launching bids for the London-born forward. But how about a return to the capital? Some are chucking Arsenal’s name into the mix of interested parties. John McGinn was mentioned on these pages on Thursday as an option for Newcastle – anyone, please, anyone – but the Athletic says Aston Villa are ready to talk about a new deal for their skipper.
