The charges relate to three women and the offences are reported to have taken place between 2021 and 2022.
He is due to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court on August 5.
Partey, 32, was first arrested in July 2022, though he was not named at the time and continued to play for Arsenal while investigations were ongoing.
In a statement, Partey's lawyer Jenny Wiltshire of Hickman and Rose, said: ""Thomas Partey denies all the charges against him. He has fully cooperated with the police and CPS throughout their three-year investigation. He now welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name.
""Given that there are now ongoing legal proceedings, my client is unable to comment further.""
The Ghana international spent five seasons at Arsenal after being signed in 2020 for £45m but is now a free agent after his contract expired on Monday. He made 52 appearances for Arsenal last season across all competitions.
In a statement to Sky Sports News, Arsenal said: ""The player's contract ended on June 30. Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case.""
Two counts of rape relate to one woman, three counts of rape relate to a second woman and one count of sexual assault relates to a third woman.
""The charges follow an investigation by detectives, which commenced in February 2022 after police first received a report of rape,"" according to the Met Police statement.
Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy, whose team is leading the investigation, said: ""Our priority remains providing support to the women who have come forward.""
Anyone who has information about the case, or has been impacted by it, is being asked to contact the Met Police.

Man Utd give five players extra time off to find moves away,Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford are among five Manchester United players that have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away after expressing a desire to leave.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13392393/man-utd-marcus-rashford-alejandro-garnacho-among-five-players-given-time-to-explore-moves-away,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 15:45:00",Dharmesh Sheth,['Manchester United'],"Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford are among five Manchester United players that have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away after expressing a desire to leave.
Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - who, along with Rashford, were away on loan last season - are part of the group that will not be reporting back to Carrington on Monday with the rest of the squad.
Matheus Cunha will take the No 10 shirt from Rashford, who said he wanted a ""new challenge"" before joining Aston Villa for the second half of last season.
One source has told Sky Sports News it has been made clear to both Rashford and Sancho that they do not figure in Ruben Amorim's plans and the pair are keen to pursue opportunities elsewhere.
If the five players' futures are not resolved during this period, they will return to Carrington, where they will continue to have full access to medical and training support.
There have been no official offers for Rashford, who remains keen on joining Barcelona. Any potential move for the 27-year-old could come later in the window after he returned from his loan at Aston Villa.
Sky Sports News has previously reported that Rashford wants to play Champions League football next season, but is not willing to relocate to London. His representatives are also against their client being involved in any part-exchange deal.
Juventus are in ongoing talks with United over the signing of Sancho. Discussions also continue with the forward's representatives over personal terms.
United's asking price is thought to be £25m for Sancho after Chelsea paid a £5m penalty to get out of their obligation to turn his loan deal permanent this summer.
Real Betis want to re-sign Antony after his successful loan spell in the second half of last season but will find it difficult to meet United's asking price.
Como have also shown an interest in Antony, but it is understood the player's preference is a return to Betis. Bayer Leverkusen, coached by Erik ten Hag, have also shown interest in the winger.
United are yet to receive any offers for Garnacho, who has been of interest to Chelsea.
The forward cast doubt over his future after being used as a substitute in the Europa League final and was subsequently left out of United's matchday squad for the final game of the season against Aston Villa.
Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven after recovering from a long-term knee injury.
Manchester United are expected to go in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.
Internal discussions at United continue over their next steps regarding their pursuit of the 25-year-old, who effectively has two years left on his deal.
There is a feeling that United's latest proposal - worth an initial £55m, reaching £62.5m with add-ons, is not far away from what Brentford want. However, the structure of the deal will be significant.
Brentford want at least £65m - with most, if not all, of that amount guaranteed.
Mbeumo only wants to join United and Brentford sporting director Phil Giles says the Cameroon international is happy stay if a deal cannot be agreed.
While United's focus is on Mbeumo and potential sales, they are still exploring a deal for a striker.
It is understood Juventus mentioned the sale of Dusan Vlahovic when talks took place over Sancho.
Juventus are desperate to sell Vlahovic - he is on huge wages and has entered the final year of his contract.
Juve are still interested in Napoli striker Victor Osimhen, who was on loan at Galatasaray last season.
Vlahovic is one of a number of strikers United have looked at and they continue to keep an eye on Ollie Watkins' situation at Aston Villa.

Villa and Chelsea fined by UEFA for breaching financial rules,Aston Villa and Chelsea have been fined by UEFA for breaches of its financial rules.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13392443/chelsea-and-aston-villa-fined-27m-and-9-5m-respectively-by-uefa-for-breaching-financial-rules,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 17:10:00",,['Chelsea'],"Aston Villa and Chelsea have been fined by UEFA for breaches of its financial rules.
Chelsea have to pay a total of £27m in fines and could pay up to £52m more if they breach their four-year agreement with the CFCB.
Aston Villa must pay £9.5m in fines and failure to comply with their three-year settlement could lead to a further penalty of up to £13m more.
Both Premier League clubs broke UEFA's football earnings rule and squad cost rule.
Villa and Chelsea had a squad cost ratio (percentage of a club's income spent on the first-team squad) of between 80 and 90 per cent for 2024.
Their fines for this breach - Aston Villa £5.1m and Chelsea £9.4m - are proportionate to the size of the club's squad cost excess. From 2025, the squad cost ratio will be 70 per cent.
Chelsea have to pay £17.2m for their breaches of the football earnings rule and that could rise to more than £69m if they breach the four-year settlement with the CFCB.
Villa were handed an unconditional fine of £4.3m for their breach of the rule and it could rise to £17.2m if they do not comply with the three-year agreement.
Both teams have agreed to a restriction on registering new players for UEFA competitions in the 2025/26 season - unless the value of new signings added to their squads is recouped in sales.
For Chelsea, this measure will also be in place for the 2026/2027 season.
If either of the clubs do not stick to the financial targets set out in the settlement, this restriction could come back into effect in subsequent seasons.
Chelsea have since commented on the matter, where they claimed to have worked ""closely and transparently"" with UEFA regarding the breaches.
The statement read: ""Chelsea FC has entered into a settlement agreement with UEFA concerning a break-even deficit reported by the club under UEFA's Financial Sustainability Regulations covering the financial years 2022/2023 and 2023/2024.
""The club has also agreed to pay a fine as a result of the club's squad cost ratio in the 2024 reporting year being between 80 per cent and 90 per cent.
""The club has worked closely and transparently with UEFA to provide a full and detailed breakdown of its financial reporting, which indicates that the financial performance of the club is on a strong upwards trajectory.
""Chelsea FC greatly values its relationship with UEFA and considered it important to bring this matter to a swift conclusion by entering into a settlement agreement.""
Villa were handed fines of £4.3m (€5m) and £5.2m (€6m) due to their respective violations.
Latest from Sky Sports News' chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:
""Chelsea have been fined a total of €31m by UEFA for breaking their financial rules. But that fine could go up to €91m, if over the next four years, they do not meet the financial targets set for them by UEFA.
""UEFA were investigating the sale of the two hotels at Stamford Bridge a couple of years ago for £76m. Those hotels were sold from one subsidiary of Chelsea's holding company to another subsidiary.
""That is allowed under Premier League rules but not UEFA rules, that is one reason why they have been fined €20m for breaking UEFA's financial monitoring rules.
""They have also been fined another €11m, which makes it €31m, for breaking the squad cost rules. Those rules say you can only spend a maximum of 80 per cent of your revenue on transfers and players' costs, such as wages and agent fees.
""They found that Chelsea had broken the 80 per cent cap and in fact, Chelsea in the 2024 financial reporting year, spent between 80 and 90 per cent of their revenue on squad costs. That is why they have been fined €11m.
""If over the four years, they step out of line, they could be in line for another fine of up to €60m.""
Sky Sports News' chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:
""They have been fined a total of €11m and if they miss targets set for them by UEFA, it could increase to a maximum of €26m.
""The €11m fine is made up of a €5m fine for breaking football earnings rules and they will pay an extra €20m if they miss the financial targets set for them by UEFA.
""They have also been fined for breaking UEFA's squad cost rule and their fine is €6m.""

'Perfect night' for Chelsea as 'exciting' Estevao gives glimpse of future,"It was a 'perfect night' for Chelsea as they beat Palmeiras to reach the Club World Cup semi-final, despite new signing Estevao Willian scoring against them.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c70r1d35e1ko,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 04:04:33",Marcus alves,['Chelsea'],"Estevao Willian could hardly have introduced himself to Chelsea in a better way.
When the 18-year-old Brazilian smashed home an equaliser for Palmeiras against the Blues from an almost impossible angle on Saturday - Chelsea fans could have been forgiven for feeling a little bit excited.
Yes, he had just equalised against their side in the Club World Cup quarter-final but it was also a thrilling glimpse of the talent Chelsea have signed in a deal that could eventually be worth £52m.
A late Palmeiras own goal meant it was ultimately Chelsea looking forward to a semi-final against Fluminense, but Estevao's last game for the Brazilians was certainly a memorable one.
The Blues beat the likes of Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain and Manchester City to sign the Palmeiras wonderkid last summer - before allowing him to stay in Brazil last season and to play for the Brazilians in this summer's Club World Cup.
And, while they may have been regretting that decision as his direct running and silky skills tormented them in Philadelphia, anyone connected with Chelsea can't fail but to be excited by what they saw.
Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said: ""Happy because we won and also happy because Estevao scored, the perfect night.
""He is very good, a huge talent, fantastic player. The only thing is when you come from South America or another part of the world is that you need to adapt.
""We are going to help him to adapt, be happy and enjoy football. We have no doubt he will be an important player for Chelsea.""
The forward was a constant threat down Palmeiras's right, had the most touches in Chelsea's box for his side (8), and was awarded man of the match for his display.
Blues midfielder Cole Palmer, who was pictured talking to him after the final whistle, added: ""You can see he is a top player, so it is very exciting.
""I just said we are excited for you to join, but he didn't understand a single word I said.""
Estevao and Palmeiras manager Abel Ferreira were tearful at the post-match press conference as they reflected on their time together.
Ferreira said: ""I spoke before with Maresca and told him 'you bought an amazing player but more than this you bought an amazing person'.
""You need to take care of him. You need to embrace him and in the beginning for sure he will make mistakes. Like you saw today he is an amazing player with a lot of skill. He is a player who can win a game alone.""
Estevao, said: ""Palmeiras opened the door for me. I was deeply happy in Palmeiras and my family knows how happy I was.
""I'm very happy I could score a goal to help my club unfortunately this wasn't the result we wanted but we gave our best on the pitch and now I am moving on.""

'Best Brazilian since Neymar'
Other Brazilian teenagers such as Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo left for Europe at the same age for huge fees.
They've both proved themselves already on the big stages since then. But none of them were as hyped as Estevao when they first moved abroad.
There's a feeling in Brazil that the boy from the countryside of Sao Paulo may be something else, the kind of player that comes along once a decade and seems destined to the very top.
""Estevao is the best player to have emerged from Brazilian football since Neymar. You watch him and you fall in love,"" the head of Palmeiras' academy, Joao Paulo Sampaio, told BBC Sport.
""He already impresses with his technique but, like Neymar at this same point in his career, he has not yet matured physically and is not as strong as Endrick, so he could still develop a lot. That's what amazes everyone and makes them think that he will reach a much higher level.""
Forget about Messinho - his name is Estevao
Estevao is a member of the so-called ""geracao do bilhao"" - a generation of players that also includes Real Madrid's Endrick and West Ham's Luis Guilherme and with whom Palmeiras expected to make 1bn Brazilian Real (around £152m).
All three have been making waves since they were kids - Estevao himself was only 10 the first time Palmeiras tried to lure him to their academy, but failed to match an offer reportedly 10 times higher from Cruzeiro.
He then became the youngest Brazilian footballer to sign a contract with Nike, surpassing Neymar (13) and Rodrygo (11), and was dubbed 'Messinho' (little Messi) for his ability to change direction and dribble past opponents while running with the ball at speed.
It hardly came as a surprise to those who had been following him when Spanish newspaper AS said during the 2023 U-17 World Cup that ""Brazil have a new genius"".
Despite the similarities with Lionel Messi, Estevao has stated he doesn't want to be called 'Messinho' anymore.
It's not only his left foot that leaves others fascinated, but also the mentality he already possesses. Sampaio recalls an episode that illustrated that.
""When we won the 2022 U-17 Brazilian Championship title, Estevao ended up breaking one of his toes during a decisive game,"" he said.
""But even so he still didn't want to leave [the game], so he came to me at half-time saying, 'I'll go back for the second half'. And I challenged him: 'You better go back.' And so he had a painkilling injection in his toe and told me, 'I'll go back, score a goal and look for you in the stands to shush you.' That's how strong he is mentally.""
No concern at all about Chelsea situation
A right winger who can also play as number 10, Estevao has always been treated differently.
He was still five months away from being able to sign his first senior contract at the age of 16 when Palmeiras, in an unusual move, announced they had agreed the terms of it.
His decision to choose Chelsea as the next step in his career has been questioned back home, due to the confusing situation of the English club and their recent record with young Brazilians such as Andrey Santos, Deivid Washington and Angelo Gabriel.
Estevao's staff has told BBC Sport they have no concerns whatsoever about it and added they believe a transfer to West London will give him a chance to break into the team more quickly compared to other clubs.
With the 2026 World Cup as his main goal, the plan is to hit the ground running at Stamford Bridge once he arrives.
""I would say that with Estevao it's not a matter of whether this place is easier or not because he's the kind of player that just goes there and gets things done. When you are an extra-class like him, that's how you do it,"" Sampaio concluded.

Former Arsenal midfielder Partey charged with rape,"The ex-Arsenal player is charged with five counts of rape relating to two women, and one count of sexual assault over a third woman.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39zr7y9ep3o,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 21:29:51",,['Arsenal'],"Former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has been charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.
The offences are reported to have taken place between 2021-2022, the Metropolitan Police said.
The charges involve three women, with two counts of rape relating to one woman, three counts of rape in connection to a second woman and one count of sexual assault linked to a third woman.
The Ghanaian international denies the charges and ""welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name"", his lawyer said.

The charges follow an investigation by detectives, which started in February 2022 after police first received a report of rape.
The 32-year-old's contract with Arsenal ended on Monday after playing with the team since 2020.
An Arsenal spokesman said: ""The player's contract ended on June 30. Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case.""
The Football Association and the Premier League declined to comment.
Det Supt Andy Furphy, who is leading the investigation, said: ""Our priority remains providing support to the women who have come forward.
""We would ask anyone who has been impacted by this case, or anyone who has information, to speak with our team. You can contact detectives about this investigation by emailing CIT@met.police.uk""
Mr Partey, of Hertfordshire, is expected to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 5 August.
In a statement, his lawyer Jenny Wiltshire said: ""Thomas Partey denies all the charges against him.
""He has fully cooperated with the police and CPS throughout their three-year investigation.

Mr Partey joined Arsenal for £45.3m from Atletico Madrid in October 2020, made 35 top-flight appearances last season and scored four goals as the London club finished second in the Premier League.
He also played 12 times in the Champions League as the Gunners reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by eventual winners Paris St-Germain.
Overall, he made 130 Premier League appearances for Mikel Arteta's side, scoring nine goals.
Mr Partey has also made more than 50 appearances for Ghana's national team, and most recently played at World Cup qualification matches in March.

Jota death 'extremely difficult to accept' - Salah,Liverpool postpone the return of some players for pre-season training on Friday following the death of Portugal forward Diogo Jota.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyn11lyxwdo,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 19:22:08",Dan Roan,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has said it is ""going to be extremely difficult to accept"" the death of fellow Reds player Diogo Jota.
Jota, aged 28, died in a car crash along with his brother Andre Silva, who was 25.
""I am truly lost for words,"" said Salah, who joined Liverpool in the summer of 2017.
""Until yesterday, I never thought there would be something that would frighten me of going back to Liverpool after the break. Team-mates come and go but not like this.
""It's going to be extremely difficult to accept that Diogo won't be there when we go back.
""My thoughts are with his wife, his children, and of course his parents who suddenly lost their children. Those close to Diogo and his brother Andre need all the support they can get. They will never be forgotten.""
The Guardia Civil told BBC Sport both men died at about 00:30 local time on Thursday.
Jota was on his way back to Liverpool for pre-season and, as doctors had advised him against flying because he had undergone minor surgery, he was making the trip by car and ferry.
Doctor Miguel Goncalves, who worked with Jota on his recovery, described him as an ""unparalleled professional"".
He told Portuguese sports newspaper Record: ""I started working with him last Saturday and I was with him every day until this Wednesday. I said goodbye to him at dinner time.
""He made an extraordinary recovery - he was undoubtedly an unparalleled professional. He strictly followed what I told him, as you could see in the way he was recovering.
""He was excited, confident in his recovery and enthusiastic about the next season.""
He married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, with who he had three children, 11 days before the fatal crash.
Liverpool delay pre-season return
Several Liverpool players were scheduled to return on Friday from their summer break for an initial round of physical tests at the club's training ground.
That was postponed and there will now be a phased return for players on Monday.
Liverpool manager Arne Slot's side are set to play their first pre-season match against Preston North End on Sunday, 13 July.
Former Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher also paid tribute to ""one of my closest friends in football"".
""We bonded over all things, sports, watching any football match we could find - often your brother Andre's game on your iPad,"" said Kelleher.
""I was surprised a lad from Portugal loved sports such as darts, snooker and horse racing so much and some of my best memories were having a laugh watching them with you.
""It's going hurt for a long time and I'm going miss you so much but I feel so lucky to have got to know you and have such a good friend.""
A vigil for Jota and Silva was held at the Chapel of Resurrection in their hometown of Gondomar later on Friday.
There will be a funeral service at 10:00 on Saturday at the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar.
Portugal and Nottingham Forest midfielder Jota Silva laid a wreath outside the chapel, where a private wake for the brothers' relatives took place on Friday afternoon.
Locals and fans have been paying tribute to Jota outside the football academy in Gondomar where he played from the age of nine to 17.
The academy is named after him and a picture shows Jota wearing both the colours of the Portugal national side and the yellow of his hometown club as a child.
People have also been paying their respects at Liverpool and former club Wolves, who he left in 2020 to join the Reds.
Everton players Beto and Youssef Chermiti, who are both Portuguese, and former Toffees midfielder Ian Snodin laid wreaths in Jota and Silva's memory outside Anfield.
Liverpool have set up a book of condolences in the Anfield Road Stand reception area and an online version of the book has also been made available to be ""accessible to fans across the globe"".

Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are also looking for a move away, with United allowing all five more time to explore their future options by delaying their pre-season return until later this month.
BBC Sport has been told the club will welcome the players back to Carrington if their futures are not resolved, allowing them access to medical and training support.
Rashford had previously indicated a willingness to return for the start of United's pre-season preparations on Monday.
The 27-year-old England forward was exiled by manager Ruben Amorim in December and spent the second half of the season on loan at Aston Villa.
Amorim had also told Garnacho, 21, he will be allowed to join a new club in the summer after the Argentine was left out of the squad for their final game of the Premier League season.
Sancho, meanwhile, returned to Old Trafford after Chelsea paid a £5m penalty not to sign him on a permanent basis following a season on loan at Stamford Bridge.
Brazil winger Antony was on loan at La Liga side Real Betis last season, while defender Malacia spent the second half of the previous campaign at PSV Eindhoven.
United's first pre-season friendly is against Leeds on 19 July in Stockholm before they go to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series friendlies.
Cunha given Rashford's number 10 shirt
Brazil forward Matheus Cunha will wear the number 10 shirt at Old Trafford next season, having completed a £62.5m move from Wolves last month.
Rashford had worn the number since 2018 after inheriting it from former Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
But with the English forward's future uncertain, the club have handed it to Cunha, who has signed a five-year deal, with the option of a further 12 months.
It is understood United made Rashford aware of the decision in advance. The club value him at £40m but are yet to receive any bids for the forward.
In February Amorim said he ""couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it"".
Rashford, who has scored 138 goals in 426 senior games during 20 years with United, said last month he would like to play alongside forward Lamine Yamal at Barcelona.
He made 17 appearances for Villa on loan, scoring four goals and providing six assists.

The move will end Walker's eight-year stay at City, where he won 17 trophies including six Premier League titles and the 2023 Champions League.

Who is Chelsea's new teenage signing Atherton?,"BBC Sport assesses the career so far of new teenage Chelsea signing Chris Atherton, the youngest player to play senior football in the United Kingdom.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c873yyxq4xdo,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 14:33:10",Richard Petrie,['Chelsea'],"It seemed only a matter of time before teenager Chris Atherton would sign for a major club. The 16-year-old forward's dream has come true as Irish Premiership club Glenavon confirmed on Thursday that he has signed for Chelsea.
Atherton made headlines in September 2022 when he became the youngest senior footballer in the United Kingdom at 13 years and 329 years old.
Indeed, he missed out on becoming the youngest senior player in the world by just 10 days, that record being held by Souleymane Mamam, who played for Togo in a World Cup qualifier against Zambia in May 2001 at 13 years and 319 days.
Having joined the Glenavon academy at four years old, the Northern Ireland Under-17 international broke the United Kingdom record when he came on as a second-half substitute for the Lurgan Blues during a 6-0 win over Dollingstown in the BetMcLean Cup.
He was a first-team regular for Glenavon throughout the 2024-25 season, scoring his first Irish Premiership goal against Loughgall in March as his club finished 10th in the 12-team top division in Northern Ireland domestic football.
'My phone started blowing up'
Asked to recall the publicity garnered by his debut appearance for Glenavon in September 2022 when he was handed his senior bow by then manager Gary Hamilton, Atherton said that it was a ""crazy"" period.
""I didn't really know what to do because it was just like out of nowhere,"" he said.
""Before the game I thought it would just be normal, because I was in training with them so I didn't realise it would be that big of a deal.
""It was only really when I walked out getting food after the game, my phone started blowing up with everything. It was everywhere. There were already articles and stuff on it, I didn't expect it to be that big.
""At first I enjoyed it and then it got a bit much. I just kind of turned my phone on silent and looked by it and tried to just focus on my football.""
'He's terrorising defences on his own at 16 years of age'
""One of the most exciting talents I've ever seen in Irish football, north or south,"" Glenavon manager Paddy McLaughlin told BBC Sport NI after the move was confirmed.
""It's how effortless he is running with the ball and past players, and I'm not talking about players in his own age group, I'm talking about senior players playing full-time football in the Irish League.
""He's gliding past them and terrorising defences on his own at 16 years of age. I've never seen it before.
""The only other player I could compare him to, and I don't want to put too much pressure on the young lad, but he's like [former Northern Ireland international] Paddy McCourt at Derry City before he got his move to Celtic.""
McLaughlin, who has coached Atherton since taking over at Mourneview Park in November 2024, appreciates how difficult it will be the make the grade at Chelsea but feels Atherton has ""all the attributes"" to succeed.
""He's got the temperament and he's got the attitude to go to the top. He just needs time because he's got the tools,"" he added.
""He's going to one of the top sides not just in England but in Europe, so I'm sure he'll be well looked after.
""We met the people from Chelsea earlier in the season, they requested to meet us, and they really think highly of him as well, they've a lot of hope for Chris.
""It's all pointing in the right direction but Chris knows there's a long way to go and a lot of hard work, there's a lot of learning and development, but there's no better man for it. He's a class act.""
'He has that air of confidence about him'
Former Northern Ireland international and prolific Irish League goalscorer Gary Hamilton was the Glenavon manager who gave Atherton his debut.
Speaking to BBC Sport NI after the young player broke through at Mourneview Park Hamilton spoke of the attributes Atherton possessed at such a young age.
""He has attracted a lot of interest from across the water and he's just got so much ability and talent.
""He goes away from here and he works hard away from the game as well. He eats right, he sleeps right and does the right things.
""Talent only gets you so far, you need to have the rest of it as well, and he does that.
""Everybody knows when you're a good footballer but he's so humble about it and so quiet off the pitch. Then when he goes onto the pitch he has that air of confidence about him and goes and believes in himself on the football pitch and he delivers.
""The players couldn't believe how good a player he is for his age.""
Making his mark at Euro 2028 announcement
Prodigious talent Atherton was introduced to the international stage when he represented Northern Ireland as a youth ambassador at the announcement in Nyon of the UK and Ireland's successful bid to host Euro 2028 in October 2023.
Speaking at the event, the then 14-year-old said that he would ""dream"" of representing Northern Ireland at the finals of the competition and that attending the announcement was a moment  he would ""remember forever"".
Atherton explained that one of his biggest thrills at the event was speaking to one of his heroes, former Wales international and ex-Tottenham and Real Madrid player Gareth Bale.
""I've had a quick chat with him a couple of photos and stuff, just fantastic. One of my idols growing up and to be alongside him is just special,"" added the Northern Ireland youngster.
Provoking a change in Irish FA rules
The impact of his debut at such a young age provoked the Irish FA to change its own rules at their June 2023 annual general meeting with players now having to be aged 16 by the end of that particular season before they can play senior football.
The Irish FA's rule change meant Atherton could no longer train with Glenavon during the 2023-24 season or even player for the reserves, instead having to restrict his club action to the Lurgan Blues' under-18 side.
But Atherton has got on with his football and continuing development has led to interest from Premier League clubs in addition to earning a place in his country's Under-17 and Victory Shield squads.

Chelsea edge Palmeiras as late deflection books Club World Cup semi-final spot,"Palmeiras 1-2 Chelsea (Estêvão 53); Palmer (16), Weverton (83, og)",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/05/palmeiras-chelsea-club-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 03:40:21",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"Their place in the last four of the Club World Cup in the bag and the prospect of a £97m windfall still up for grabs, Chelsea found themselves in an unusual position: relieved to have survived a taxing second half, hailing Malo Gusto’s unlikely role as matchwinner and able to delight in the opposition’s goalscorer being named superior player of the match.
For a while the story of this entertaining quarter-final looked like it was going to be about Enzo Maresca finding it within himself to forgive Estêvão Willian. Everything had changed when the Brazilian sensation, who joins Chelsea after this tournament, cancelled out an early goal from Cole Palmer and hauled Palmeiras level at the start of the second half.
Quiet during the first half, Estêvão threatened to take over and send his next team back to England. The consolation for Chelsea was likely to be seeing exactly why they have paid £52m to sign a talent tipped by many good judges to win the Ballon d’Or one day.
Yet that uncomfortable conversation between Estêvão and Maresca was averted thanks to a horrendous error from Weverton seven minutes from time, a deflected cross from Gusto somehow deceiving the Palmeiras goalkeeper and bobbling in. Palmeiras, who have never won this competition, could not believe their misfortune. They lost late to Chelsea in the final three years ago; now they were out thanks to an own-goal from their goalkeeper.
Not that Chelsea cared. The future looks bright. Palmer and Estêvão working in tandem after this tournament? It is a delicious prospect and Chelsea’s owners will have loved the symbolism of the duo embracing at half-time. As for the present, the focus is on reaching next Sunday’s final in New York. Next up are Fluminese, who beat Al-Hilal in the day’s other quarter-final, and that means a reunion with a Brazilian from a different era: the former Chelsea centre-back, Thiago Silva.
There was also rare positive PR for Fifa given that its dynamic pricing model pulled in a bigger crowd than expected and quelled any debate over scheduling this tie on Independence Day. This, after all, was far from the biggest show in town on Friday. Fourth of July festivities tend to be quite a big deal in Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, and anyone looking for ways to mark the holiday could choose from Major League Baseball at nearby Citizens Bank Park, free concerts and a fireworks show in the city centre.
But prices dropping as low as $11.15 (£8.17) ensured there was a decent attendance at Lincoln Financial Field, where attention was on the weirdness of Estêvão playing his future employers. What to do? In Marc Cucurella’s case it was to stick tight to the teenager and kick him at every opportunity. It was as if the left-back was determined to show Estêvão what it will be like in the Premier League. The challenges were physical and there was even a blast of fury from Cucurella after Estêvão had a nibble at Levi Colwill midway through the first half.
Chelsea were aggressive. The worry for Maresca was how his midfield would function without the suspended Moises Caicedo and the injured Romeo Lavia. Enzo Fernandez moved deeper but there was another rejig when Reece James suffered an injury during the warm-up, forcing Maresca to hand a first start to Andrey Santos.
In that context, perhaps it was not a surprise when Chelsea grew a little ragged in the second half. Making up for the absence of Caicedo’s power and Lavia’s elegance was not easy for Santos. The 21-year-old Brazilian is still adjusting to Maresca’s system after an impressive loan spell at Strasbourg, although this was still an encouraging first step. Playing in a deeper role, Santos asked for the ball, got stuck in and did not hide when the game got tough after half-time.
Palmeiras, who were without key figures in defence, had struggled at first. Maresca had left it up to Pedro Neto to decide if he wanted to play after the death of his friend and Portugal team-mate Diogo Jota. Neto was excused from training on Thursday and it would not have been a surprise if the winger had accepted the offer of compassionate leave.
Instead, though, the 25-year-old lined up on the right wing and was soon giving Micael the run around. Palmer, playing as a No 10, was just as elusive. Sixteen minutes in, he moved to the right, took a pass from Trevoh Chalobah and turned. The outcome was inevitable. Palmer swerved on to his left foot, held off a couple of challenges and threaded a low shot into the right corner from 20 yards.
Chelsea remained on top. They should have scored again, only for Christopher Nkunku to shoot over. There was a lull as half-time approached. Richard Rios had an opening for Palmeiras. Liam Delap ruled himself out of the semi-final after picking up a booking.
The mind went back to Chelsea blowing a half-time lead against Flamengo during the group stage. The Brazilian teams are not to be underestimated. Palmeiras emerged with more intensity at the start of the second half. The narrative turned in the 53rd minute. There was a clever pass from the right from Rios. Estêvão nipped in, stepping past Colwill, and then came the demonstration of his unique talent: the daring to shoot from such a tight angle, the bravery to take it with his weaker right foot, and the technique to catch Robert Sanchez out at his near post, the ball flying past the Chelsea goalkeeper and going in off the bar.
Maresca responded by removing Delap for Joao Pedro and bringing Noni Madueke on for the disappointing Nkunku. Chelsea rallied. Joao Pedro, who has only had a couple of training sessions since joining from Brighton this week, looked bright. Madueke brought more drive on the left.
The game flew from end to end. Palmeiras were too open. Chelsea kept working themselves into promising positions, although the nature of the winning goal owed more to luck than judgement, Gusto squeezing in a cross, the ball changing course and Weverton not reacting in time.

Thomas Partey: the former Arsenal midfielder facing five rape charges,Ghanaian left club this week after playing a central role in Premier League title challenges under Mikel Arteta,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/thomas-partey-the-former-arsenal-midfielder-facing-five-charges,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 18:34:06",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"For the first time since Thomas Partey left his home town of Krobo Odumase in eastern Ghana at the age of 11, he woke on Tuesday without a club. Three days later the midfielder, who had departed Arsenal after his contract expired, was charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.
What happens next with Partey’s career will be determined by the outcome of legal proceedings scheduled to start with his appearance at Westminster magistrates court on 5 August. The allegations relate to three women who reported incidents between 2021 and 2022. Partey denies all the charges and “welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name”, his lawyer said.
Partey, 32, had been linked with moves to Spain, Turkey and Saudi Arabia in recent weeks after talks over extending his Arsenal contract hit an impasse, even though Arsenal’s manager, Mikel Arteta, had insisted in May that he wanted him to stay. “Consistency-wise it’s been his best season,” Arteta said. “The way he’s played, performed, his availability, has been exceptional and he’s a really important player for us.”
Partey joined Arsenal from Atlético Madrid in a record fee paid for a Ghanaian player – £45m – in October 2020. He struggled with injuries during his first two seasons at the Emirates but became a regular during the 2022-23 campaign when Arsenal finished as runners-up behind Manchester City. A hamstring injury in November 2023 kept Partey out for most of the following season before he emerged as a key performer last season at the base of Arsenal’s midfield.
The impending arrival of Martín Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a £51m deal that has been in the pipeline since January affected Partey’s status as a first choice, with the Spain international expected to line up alongside Martin Ødegaard and Declan Rice in a recalibrated midfield.
Partey is understood to have been offered a new deal on slightly reduced terms and confirmation of his departure came with Arsenal having agreed a fee that could rise to £15m to bring in Brentford’s Christian Nørgaard as his replacement. Partey made 52 appearances last season. Arsenal will face questions about whether it was appropriate for him to have continued playing while being investigated by the police over such serious allegations.
Partey moved to Europe after being spotted playing for Ashaiman Revelation FC in Accra as a teenager. “I played for them until I was 18, which is when I moved to Spain,” Partey told Arsenal’s website. “But that was the club I grew up at as a footballer. We had a good, young, talented team at the time, and I still have a few mates from that time who are now playing elsewhere in Europe. They are not at the very top now but they are still playing and I still talk with them a lot.”
He was encouraged to attend trials in Spain by his father, who coached him as a junior, and joined Leganés before moving to Atlético in 2012. The tough-tackling player was sent on loan to Mallorca and Almería before eventually making his debut for Diego Simeone’s side in 2015. He made almost 200 appearances for Atlético and was part of the side beaten in the 2016 Champions League final by Real Madrid before winning the Europa League two years later.
Partey has played 52 times for his country, scoring nine goals. Ghana confirmed last month that Partey had been “given a break by head coach Otto Addo” after he wasn’t included in their squad for the Unity Cup tournament in London. He also missed their Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Angola and Niger last November after holding “confidential” talks with Addo.
Partey has represented Ghana at three Afcon finals and the 2022 World Cup, where they were eliminated in the group stages. He remains one of the country’s most famous figures.

‘It’s offensive’: voices from Iran as fans face 2026 World Cup travel ban,"After Donald Trump banned Iranians from entering the US, one of the co-hosts, there are different views on what should be done",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/05/iran-fans-2026-world-cup-us-donald-trump-travel-ban,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 07:00:05",John Duerden,['Manchester City'],"“It’s offensive for any football fan to be prevented from participating in the World Cup, not just Iranians,” Ali Rezaei of Tehran’s Borna News Agency says. In March, the national team became the second to qualify for the 2026 World Cup that will be hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States. In June, Donald Trump authorised the dropping of bombs on Iran and hit the country with a travel ban. As things stand, while the national team will be able to enter the US next summer, fans – and perhaps media – will not.
Residents of Tehran and other cities may have had enough to deal with of late, but still, being barred from entry stings, even if Iranians have long found it difficult to get into the US. “If the US government has issues with the Iranian regime for any reason, it should not result in discrimination against Iranian citizens,” Behnam Jafarzadeh, a writer for leading sports site Varzesh3, says. “If someone hasn’t committed any illegal activity, why should they be punished? It’s not just about the World Cup – the policy needs to change in general.”
What can Iran do? “Boycotting the World Cup is not a solution,” Siavash Pakdaman, a Tehran-based fan, says. “Refusing to play on US soil would be a dangerous precedent – any host country could start excluding teams it has issues with. Just as the Iranian delegation can and should be present at the United Nations in the US, the Iranian team should also play on American soil if the draw requires it – without relocation.”
There is a feeling that staying away would not make much difference anyway. “It would only deprive the national team of the opportunity to participate in a major tournament and would ultimately hurt Iran more,” Jafarzadeh says. “It might even be welcomed by some American officials. It could make headlines briefly, but once the tournament starts, it will be forgotten and will have achieved nothing.”
Questions have been asked – including in Iran, whose supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has long banned competing against Israeli athletes – about what the international reaction would have been if Qatar had banned citizens from certain nations from attending the 2022 World Cup.
“If the USA makes it difficult for football fans to attend, then changing the host country is necessary,” Rezaei says. “Doing so would harm the USA’s reputation, not the World Cup’s. If strict entry rules remain, we should focus on protecting football. This is supposed to be a celebration of sport.”
Jafarzadeh is not confident that the competition could be taken away from the busiest of the three hosts. “It is not a challenge Fifa and [its president Gianni] Infantino would want to take on.” Perhaps there is another way. “Fifa should use all of its influence to push for a suspension of this policy at least during the World Cup.”
Fifa may find it easier to place Iran in Canada or Mexico and hope that Iran don’t make it to the latter stages, when there would have to be a game in the US. “Playing in Mexico or Canada is not a real solution – it just ignores the actual problem,” Rezaei says.
Many expect it to happen anyway. “Canada has a large Iranian immigrant population, although some of them are opponents of the Iranian regime and the national team can’t count on their support,” Jafarzadeh says. “Mexico is probably a more attractive and less controversial destination for the team.”
That is another question. The Iranian-American community is more than a million strong yet many of these headed west before, or in response to, the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
“It seems that many Iranians who oppose the government consider the national team to be a representation of the regime – which I believe is wrong,” Pakdaman says. “And since a larger number of these opponents live in the US, the team may face pressure from the audience during the matches. Of course, I hope my analysis is wrong.”
Jafarzadeh, who went to the World Cups in Russia and Qatar and would love to go to the United States, says: “Some see the team as one that represents the regime, and this sentiment is even stronger among Iranians living abroad. Of course, the war with Israel has stirred feelings of patriotism among many Iranians, but I’m not sure if this will translate into support for the national team. We’ll have to wait and see how things unfold in the coming months.”
That there is time is perhaps a small reason for optimism that things could change. Iran is one of 19 countries subject to a full or partial US entry ban. Several of the others retain hope of qualifying for the first 48-team World Cup, including Sudan, Sierra Leone, Venezuela and Haiti.
“Considering that there is almost a year left until the 2026 World Cup, there is a possibility that the situation may stabilise,” says Isa Azimi, a columnist and translator, regarding Iran’s situation, though he is not confident. “Despite claims of separating politics from football, Fifa has shown that it is not particularly independent when facing major political powers.”
Especially when Infantino appears to prize his close relationship with Trump. “If Fifa considers itself a global body independent of governments, it must stand up to such laws and not allow politics to contaminate the world of sports,” Pakdaman says. “Of course, we all know that, unfortunately, such contamination exists – especially when one side of the issue is a superpower that answers to no one. It is Fifa’s duty to treat all member countries equally, but will that actually happen?”

Kyle Walker closes in on shock £5m move to Burnley from Manchester City,Right-back will sign two-year deal at Turf Moor,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/kyle-walker-shock-5m-transfer-burnley-manchester-city,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 19:32:10",Will Unwin,"['Manchester City', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Kyle Walker is poised to make a surprise move from Manchester City to Burnley after the two clubs agreed a £5m deal for the right-back, who will sign a two-year deal at Turf Moor.
The 35-year-old England international, who spent the second half of last season out on loan at Milan, played alongside Scott Parker at Tottenham and will reunite with his former teammate once he has completed a medical. Burnley have been seeking Premier League experience in the transfer market as they bid to survive in the top flight after earning promotion from the Championship.
The move to Burnley will allow Walker to stay in the north-west, something he has been eager to do following his six months in Italy. Walker had interest from across the globe but wanted to stay close to his family. Everton were previously interested in signing the defender but Walker has eventually been lured to Burnley.
Walker, who has 96 international caps, won 17 trophies during his time with City but was keen for a new challenge last season. Pep Guardiola sanctioned the temporary move to Milan and left him out of the Club World Cup squad, signifying he would not return to the first-team fold once his loan had come to an end.
He will become the club’s fourth signing of the summer after fellow defenders Axel Tuanzebe, Quilindschy Hartman and goalkeeper Max Weiss.
Meanwhile, Newcastle have agreed a £55m fee with Nottingham Forest for Anthony Elanga, with the winger set to complete a move to the Champions League side in the coming days.
The winger’s personal terms are not thought to be an issue and the signing of the Sweden international will end a year-long pursuit by Eddie Howe. Newcastle tried to sign Elanga last summer but the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, was adamant he would not be sold.
A fee of £55m was seen as too good to refuse for a player the club purchased for £15m two seasons ago from Manchester United.
The 23-year-old has excelled at the City Ground helping Forest to qualify for Europe for the first time in more than 30 years. Last season he scored six goals and created 11 more in his 38 appearances as Forest finished seventh in the league.
Forest will make the 22-year-old PSV winger Johan Bakayoko, who has been tracked by Borussia Dortmund and by rival Premier League clubs, a prominent target if Elanga departs.

"Garnacho, Rashford and Sancho among five who tell Manchester United they want out",Antony and Malacia also ask for transfers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/marcus-rashford-to-report-for-pre-season-training-at-manchester-united-next-week,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 14:58:00",Will Unwin,"['Manchester United', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford are among five players who have asked to leave Manchester United and been told they do not need to return for pre-season training next week. Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho have also requested transfers and been given more time away from the club to sort their futures.
Rashford, whose No 10 shirt has been given to the new signing Matheus Cunha, was sent on loan last season with Malacia, Antony and Sancho and it was always unlikely they would have a future under Ruben Amorim. Garnacho struggled for minutes in the latter part of the season and was a substitute in the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham. “I played 20 minutes today – I don’t know,” he said after that game. “I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.”
The club have made their rehabilitation and medical facilities available to the five players but they will not be part of group sessions. If any fail to secure a departure, they will be welcomed back to train at Carrington later in July.
Garnacho has been linked with Chelsea, and Rashford has interested Barcelona, who have missed out on the Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams, who has signed a new 10-year contract, enhancing the chances that the England international will head to Catalonia. Rashford has spent time working with a personal trainer in Spain to maintain fitness.
Malacia was on loan at PSV last season but the full-back’s fitness record has meant interested parties are in short supply. Chelsea did not take up their option to sign Sancho permanently but talks with Juventus have been held recently. Antony impressed at Real Betis after a disastrous spell at Old Trafford.
United informed Rashford’s representatives of the fact that Cunha would take the No 10 shirt. The change is said not to be related to the forward’s clear desire to leave.
United are working to overhaul the squad to make it more suited to Amorim’s style of play. They have signed Cunha from Wolves and are working on a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford after having two bids rejected for the Cameroonian.
United’s finances mean they need to sell if they want to buy and they will hope to get about £60m for Garnacho, an academy graduate, which would ease the situation. The four forwards’ wages will limit the number of prospective suitors.

Mourners gather in Portugal for Diogo Jota’s wake as Salah and Robertson pay tribute,Mourners gathered on Friday morning to honour Liverpool footballer Diogo Jota at a vigil in Portugal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/diogo-jota-portugal-liverpool-wake-tributes,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 14:38:01",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Mourners have gathered at a vigil in Portugal to commemorate Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, following their deaths in a car accident.
Jota and his 25-year-old sibling died when the Lamborghini they were travelling in careered off a road in north-western Spain in the early hours of Thursday. The bodies of the two professional footballers were returned to Portugal later that day. Jota was 28 and had married his long-term partner, Rute Cardoso, 11 days before his death. They had three young children.
José Manuel Macedo, parish priest at the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar in São Cosme, said that a vigil for the brothers was taking place at the nearby Capela da Ressurreição on Friday before their funeral at the Igreja Matriz church on Saturday at 10am. Jota and Silva grew up in Gondomar, a small city east of Porto.
Liverpool have chartered a plane to take club staff to Portugal before the funeral service. Liverpool players, most of whom are currently on holiday, will also be in attendance. The majority were due to report back for the start of pre-season training early next week but all football-related activity at the club, from first team to academy level, has been put on hold. The club’s priority is supporting Jota’s bereaved family.
On Friday Mohamed Salah said Jota’s death had left him dreading going back to Liverpool. “I am truly lost for words,” he wrote on social media. “Until yesterday, I never thought there would be something that would frighten me of going back to Liverpool after the break. Teammates come and go but not like this. It’s going to be extremely difficult to accept that Diogo won’t be there when we go back.
“My thoughts are with his wife, his children, and of course his parents who suddenly lost their children. Those close to Diogo and his brother Andre need all the support they can get. They will never be forgotten.”
Jota had been working with Dr Miguel Gonçalves in Portugal before his return to pre-season training, having undergone a procedure on his lung. In an interview with Portuguese media outlet Record, Dr Gonçalves said: “I said goodbye to him and his brother, André, at around 8.30pm. His brother was a great companion and decided to go with him, to accompany him on the trip, and that way they would also spend more time together.
“They were going to travel at night because it was cooler, but they weren’t going direct. He told me that the journey would take about eight hours but that they would stop at a hotel in the Burgos area to rest. Diogo was very aware of his professionalism. They were only supposed to arrive in Santander today [Friday], catch the boat and then go to England. The family would arrive later by plane, organise their lives over the weekend and then, on Monday, they had a medical appointment scheduled in Liverpool to assess the situation.”
Dr Gonçalves claimed Jota was receiving specialist treatment over a collapsed lung. He added: “I started working with him last Saturday and I was with him every day until this Wednesday. I said goodbye to him at dinner time. He made an extraordinary recovery, he was undoubtedly an unparalleled professional. He strictly followed what I told him, as you could see in the way he was recovering.
“The base of his right lung had collapsed a little, but with the post-surgery physiotherapy he was practically flawless. When I left him yesterday he was no longer in pain and was going to return to Liverpool. He was excited, confident in his recovery and enthusiastic about the next season. He told me that he would not go on the pre-season tour that Liverpool is going to Japan to strengthen his recovery, he believed he was going to have a great season.”
Liverpool players have spoken of their pain in paying tribute to their teammate. Virgil van Dijk, the captain, said on Instagram he was “absolutely devastated and in total disbelief”. The defender wrote in a post alongside a picture of Jota with the Premier League trophy: “What a human being, what a player, but most importantly what an unbelievable family man.
“You meant so much to all of us and you always will! For your family to lose two sons, a husband and a father is just unimaginable. So cruel and unfair. My heart is breaking for all of your beautiful family, for Rute and for your kids. I promise you that in these difficult times and beyond we will always be there for your family.
“A champion forever, number 20 forever. It’s been a privilege to have stood by your side on the pitch, and to have been your friend off it. We will miss you beyond words and never forget you. Your legacy will live on, we will make sure of it! Rest in perfect peace Diogo & André.”
Andy Robertson, a close friend of the popular striker, also paid an emotional tribute. “The ones I’m thinking about most right now are the family. Their loss is too much to bear,” the Scotland left-back posted on Instagram. “I’m so sorry that they have lost two such precious souls – Diogo and André. For the team and the club, we’ll try to cope with this together … however long that takes.
“For me, I want to talk about my mate. My buddy. The bloke I loved and will miss like crazy. I could talk about him as a player for hours, but none of that feels like it matters right now. It’s the man. The person. He was such a good guy. The best. So genuine. Just normal and real. Full of love for the people he cared about. Full of fun. He was the most British foreign player I’ve ever met. We used to joke he was really Irish ... I’d try to claim him as Scottish. I even called him Diogo MacJota. We’d watch the darts together, enjoy the horse racing. Going to Cheltenham this season was a highlight – one of the best we had.
“The last time I saw him was the happiest day of his life – his wedding day. I want to remember his never-ceasing smile from that magical day. How much he was bursting with love for his wife and family. I can’t believe we’re saying goodbye. It’s too soon, and it hurts so much. But thank you for being in my life, mate – and for making it better”.
The former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson returned to Anfield on Friday to pay his own respects to Jota. Henderson was visibly moved as he laid flowers among the huge number of tributes to the striker and spent time reading some of the messages in memory of Jota and his brother. The Ajax captain, who played alongside Jota for three seasons, later signed the book of condolence that Liverpool have opened inside the stadium.
“Jots it was a pleasure to share a pitch with you but more importantly a friendship,” Henderson wrote on Instagram. “All the laughs we had off the pitch and trying to find ways to wind milly [James Milner] up and get him fined, which we never could. Taking pictures of me asleep on the bus travelling then sending them to me later. You always wanted to have a laugh and were a pleasure to be around.
“I know how much Rute and your family meant to you and I know you will always be looking down on them. Thank you for everything you brought into this world, we will all miss you.”
 A delegation from Everton that included their two Portuguese-born forwards Beto and Youssef Chermiti also visited Anfield to pay tribute to Jota, whose final goal came against them in the Merseyside derby in April. The Everton players and club ambassador Ian Snodin were applauded by Liverpool fans as they each left a wreath outside the stadium. One read: “Our city is united in grief. With deepest sympathy from all at Everton Football Club.”
At Wimbledon, the Portuguese pair Nuno Borges and Francisco Cabral paid tribute to their compatriot by wearing black ribbons on court. Borges wore the item on his cap during his third-round singles match with 17th seed Karen Khachanov after Cabral donned one on his shirt sleeve during his doubles match earlier on Friday as the All England Club relaxed its strict all-white dress code to allow tributes to the Liverpool forward.
Uefa has announced that a moment of silence will be observed at Women’s Euro 2025 matches on Friday, as they were on Thursday.

Anxiety and excitement combine for Williamson with Wiegman’s new England,Lionesses captain admits much has changed since 2022 with the manager stressing that team has to move on as they prepare for France,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/euro-2025-williamson-wiegman-new-england-france,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 18:02:14",Suzanne Wrack,['Arsenal'],"Leah Williamson said she had felt anxious in the buildup to ­England beginning their European title defence against France on Saturday night, the Arsenal defender having missed the 2023 World Cup after an anterior cruciate ligament injury.
“I’ve probably held some anxiety up until this moment just because I wanted to be here and I wanted to be here with the team and I wanted to experience another ­tournament with England,” said the ­Lionesses’ captain. “It’s special when you come to another country, to ­represent your country and just take ­everything in. It’s a bit different to England in 2022. I’m very excited but so much has changed, so I’m intrigued to come back and enjoy this ­tournament football.”
England look different from the team that beat Germany in the final in 2022. Millie Bright stepped back to protect her mental and physical health and Jill Scott, Ellen White, Rachel Daly, Mary Earps and Fran Kirby have retired completely or, in the case of the last two, retired from ­international duty. The mantra has been that this is a new England.
“The team has been a bit in ­transition, of course,” the manager, Sarina Wiegman, said, “and we ­absolutely cherish what we have done before, and we never forget it, and those are lifetime experiences for us and for our families and also for the fans. But you have to move on and you have to be on top. Things are changing very quickly, so we have to, too. We came together in February and we said: ‘It’s a new challenge.’ The approach was there anyway, but we called it the New England.”
France have changed too, but there are familiar faces everywhere, not least in the dynamic Chelsea forward Sandy Baltimore. How do you stop her? “Whisper in her ear,” said Lucy Bronze, her Chelsea teammate, with a grin. What do you say? “Nothing in English,” the England full-back said, still grinning.
Bronze, competing at her seventh major tournament having been part of every Euros and World Cup squad since 2013, has probably played with or against most players in ­Switzerland for Euro 2025.
There is one absent face in ­particular she will miss, though – that of the France centre-back Wendie Renard, who was dropped by the manager, Laurent Bonadei, along with Kenza Dali and Eugénie Le ­Sommer. It is a testament to Bronze’s competitive nature that she was unhappy about Renard’s omission.
“I want to play against Wendie,” she said of her former Lyon ­teammate. “I want to play against the ­strongest French team. I want Wendie to be playing, defending corners and I can jump over her and win the ball. ­Winning a header over Wendie Renard, that’s an achievement.”
Renard’s replacement as France’s captain, Griedge Mbock, another former Lyon clubmate of Bronze’s, is a doubt. The Paris Saint-Germain centre-back has been training ­separately after a calf injury. The potential stand-in, 21-year-old Alice Sombath, who has four caps, was also at Lyon with Bronze. “She’s probably got more maturity than people might give her credit for,” Bronze said.
France have an enviable ­attacking lineup that includes Kadidiatou Diani, Baltimore and Marie-­Antoinette Katoto. “I think England have one of the best attacking lineups,” said Bronze. “The type of attackers France have got, we have quite similar, and as defenders we defend against that every day in training.”

No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football
Bronze has played in some of the best teams in the history of women’s domestic football, so where does ­England’s front three, likely to be drawn from Alessia Russo, Lauren Hemp, Beth Mead, Lauren James and Chloe Kelly, rank in terms of ­providing that top-level test of a defender in training?
“I’d say it’s similar to those kinds of teams that I’ve been in,” said Bronze. “I might be playing up against Hempo for 30 minutes and then it’s LJ, then it’s Chloe; it’s just non-stop, and they’ve all got such ­different ­attributes. Even someone like Michelle [Agyemang], who is relatively young, just runs into ­people and bodies them because she’s so strong.”
James is ready to play more ­minutes, said Wiegman, after returning from a hamstring injury as a ­substitute against Jamaica last weekend. “I won’t give you the lineup but she played 30 minutes last week so she can play more than that,” the manager said.
After France, England face the 2017 European champions, the ­Netherlands, on Wednesday before completing the group stage against Wales. It has been referred to as the group of death. There is little room for error.
Bronze said it was “a good and a bad thing” having to start against a serious contender. “If we lose that game, everyone says it’s the worst; if we win that game, it’s the best,” she said. “We just try to look at the positives: the fact that we get to test ourselves against the good teams straight away. There’s no surprises going through the tournament. We know the standard that you have to be at. When you get to these kinds of tournaments, you want to play in the big games against the best ­players. Why not have it in your first game? It makes it more exciting.”

Chelsea face doubts over registering signings with Uefa after £27m fine,Aston Villa and Barcelona also punished over finances,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/chelsea-aston-villa-and-barcelona-fined-by-uefa-over-spending-rule-breaches,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 17:57:11",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea, Aston Villa and Barcelona have been fined by Uefa for ­breaking financial rules. Chelsea have been hit with a €31m (£27m) fine, with a ­potential further €60m looming over the next four years if they fail to ­comply with regulations again. They also face doubts over whether they will be able to register new signings in ­European competitions over the next two seasons.
Villa have been fined a total of €11m with a further €15m suspended for the next three years. Barcelona have been fined €15m and are also at risk of further conditional penalties.
Chelsea’s punishment leaves them under pressure to make sales this summer before their return to the Champions League. Uefa’s judgment included the detail that Chelsea would be forbidden from including new players in their squad for Europe next season and in 2026-27 unless they can show they have generated a cost saving with sale of players against acquisitions.
Chelsea have bought Liam Delap for £30m and João Pedro in a deal worth up to £60m. They have agreed a deal to sign the Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens and will add Palmeiras’s Estêvão Willian to their squad after the Club World Cup. Chelsea were already looking to make sales and are open to offers for Noni Madueke and Christopher Nkunku. A number of others, including João Félix and Raheem Sterling, have no future at the club. Sterling has two years left on a contract worth £325,000 a week.
Chelsea and Villa breached Uefa’s football earnings and squad-cost rules (SCR), the latter of which limits clubs operating in European competition to spending 80% of their revenue on player costs. Villa face being fined €5m for every year they breach ­financial rules. A new three-year cycle started in 2024-25.
Villa are confident they can absorb the fine and strengthen Unai Emery’s squad while agreeing to move in line with SCR. Villa and Uefa are understood to have agreed a “glide path” to meet their targets. Villa, who are also confident of avoiding a possible points deduction from the Premier League after moving to sell their women’s team to comply with financial rules, are adamant they do not need to sell key players.
The future of Emiliano Martínez, however, is uncertain, and while Aston Villa are yet to receive a bid for the Argentina goalkeeper, they are braced for further interest in the 32-year-old, who is under contract until 2029., Chelsea, Manchester United and Atlético Madrid, are thought to hold an interest in the World Cup-winner.
Reducing the wage bill is a priority for Villa. YesterdayOn Friday, the club confirmed they have terminated the contract of Philippe Coutinho, who has signed permanently for Vasco de Gama, his boyhood club. Villa want to trim the squad and offload fringe players, with Kaine Kesler-Hayden joining Coventry in a £3.5m deal and Emiliano Buendia, Louie Barry and Alex Moreno also poised to leave. Lyon (€12.5m), Besiktas (€900,000) Panathinaikos (€400,000) and Hajduk Split (€300,000) have also been sanctioned by Uefa.

Football Daily | Infantino awaits his ‘big bang’ as Club World Cup refuses to slide away,Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/football-daily-email-club-world-cup-quarter-finals,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 15:28:10",Barry Glendenning,['Liverpool'],"ROLL WITH IT
Like Dr John Hammond and his scientists in Jurassic Park, Gianni Infantino and his fawning Fifa lickspittles have spent recent years so preoccupied with whether or not they could, that they didn’t stop to think if they should. The upshot is that a preposterously lucrative tournament described by its creator as “a big bang” has been crowbarred into an already jam-packed calendar. And the largesse of its in-no-way unethically sourced prize-money for those participating now threatens to destroy several already under-threat footballing ecosystems around the world.
Excessive heat, often sparse crowds, overambitious stadium bookings, concerns over immigration raids, exhausted players, that Juventus video from the Oval Office, Saudi money, individual player walk-ons, discordant mismatches, lengthy weather delays – the list of snags that need to be ironed out in the inevitable future editions of Copa Gianni goes on and on. But if you can see past the Fifa overlord’s self-aggrandising and disingenuous bombast, this brain-fart of his is a wheeze that’s not entirely without merit. And with the quarter-finals upon us, the tournament might finally live up to the garrulous hype with which Fifa’s equivalent of The Simpsons’ monorail guy Lyle Lanley has long been trying to sell it to us marks.
First up are Al-Hilal and Fluminense in Orlando, the stuff of lurid Infantino fantasies that will ensure either a Saudi Pro League side or a Brazilian team will make the final four. One of two remaining Brazilian sides left in the competition, Fluminense have thoroughly enjoyed their stateside sojourn and are favourites to see off the self-styled plucky Saudi underdogs who have spent just £412m on transfers over the past two years. While most of their fans will be in bed, Chelsea take on Palmeiras, but may have to make do without one of their players of the tournament, Pedro Neto, who is mourning the sudden loss of his great friend Diogo Jota. “In terms of Pedro, he is very sad,” said Enzo Maresca. “Probably more than sad. I had a chat this morning with Pedro. We support him. Any decision he will take is the correct one.”
In what would certainly have been billed as the Bellingham Brothers derby if Jobe hadn’t gone and earned himself a spell on the Naughty Step, Dortmund play Real Madrid at the MetLife Stadium in Noo Joyzee, while Bigger Cup winners Paris Saint-Germain go toe-to-toe with Bayern in Atlanta. “We feel that when we’re at our best, we can beat anyone,” chirruped Harry Kane, reading from his Big Book of Pre-Match Platitudes. “We’ll approach this match with the same feeling.” As for the plodding dinosaurs who’ve been brought back from extinction? Well, their eagerly-awaited reunion tour kicks off later in Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium and, unlike at Copa Gianni, the dynamically priced tickets are sold out.

QUOTE OF THE DAY
I want to talk about my mate. My buddy. The bloke I loved and will miss like crazy. I could talk about him as a player for hours, but none of that feels like it matters right now. It’s the man. The person. He was such a good guy. The best. So genuine. Just normal and real. Full of love for the people he cared about. Full of fun. He was the most British foreign player I’ve ever met. I can’t believe we’re saying goodbye. It’s too soon, and it hurts so much. But thank you for being in my life, mate – and for making it better” – Liverpool’s Andy Robertson remembers his friend, Diogo Jota. And Miguel Dantas reports on how the deaths of Jota and his brother André Silva have shaken Portugal, where mourners are gathering in Gondomar for the funeral on Saturday.

Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid give all-clear for Arsenal to sign Rodrygo?,Today’s rumours don’t really have their heart in it,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-give-all-clear-for-arsenal-to-sign-rodrygo,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 09:23:21",Stuart Goodwin,['Arsenal'],"Four days into July, Arsenal fans could be forgiven for getting antsy over their outgoings list outnumbering their incomings by seven to one. If Gunnersaurus had ears they’d be pricking ozone-wards at word that Real Madrid are willing to let Rodrygo leave during the current window. Xabi Alonso seemingly likes the trade-off of losing a player who doesn’t currently waltz into his preferred XI (just 88 mins of action at the Club World Cup to date) and getting a fee not far short of £80m to help continue his reconfiguration at the Bernabéu.
The tricksy 24-year-old is seen as a substantial upgrade on Arsenal’s current threats from the left wing, but his arrival would not necessarily herald the exit of his Brazilian compatriot Gabriel Martinelli. A player who will leave, however, is knack-plagued defender Takehiro Tomiyasu, whose contract is being ripped up. That’s, thankfully, a situation suiting both parties, with the Japan international still almost half a year from returning to action after an endless string of knee twangs.
Despite the relative hush, there is plenty of Stamford Bridge-related hubbub today: Djordje Petrovic has swiftly gone from being a goalkeeper who “might just be the one Chelsea needed all along” at the start of 2024 to being one of Enzo Maresca’s Expendables. Sunderland’s lively window looks likely to feature completion of a £21.5m deal for the Serbian before Monday’s Mill arrives.
Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund’s Reading-born winger Jamie Gittens is all but Chelsea’s player now, with the German club having gone surprisingly early with a well-wishing statement.
The former Blues forward Tammy Abraham, not that long ago a headline attraction for the Mill, quietly completed a loan move from Roma to Besiktas on Thursday, with “a conditional obligation to buy”.
Speaking of Blues, Birmingham pounced on Thursday to bring Demarai Gray back to where it all began, thus ending his Saudi Pro League adventure with Al-Ettifaq. That spell unfortunately yielded more yellow cards (one) than goals or assists, but his three-year deal offers plenty of scope to improve those numbers for the Championship side.
Elsewhere in the Midlands, Aston Villa are purportedly closing in on Toulouse’s Jaydee Canvot – the 18-year-old, a French youth international centre-back, caught eyes in 18 Ligue 1 outings last season and reports in France suggest that Unai Emery has successfully beckoned the youngster in his club’s direction despite interest from Everton and Bournemouth. A fee in the region of £17m-£20m is said to be plenty, ta.
Finally, a bit of a Mill tap-in to finish, expect Anthony Elanga pen-in-hand pics with various Newcastle-affiliated logos as a background at more or less any time from here. Their improved offer is thought to be just the job for Forest, cheers.
