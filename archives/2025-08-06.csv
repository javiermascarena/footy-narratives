Sesko's preference is to join Man Utd over Newcastle,Sky Sports News understands there is now a growing feeling Benjamin Sesko wants to join Manchester United over rival bidders Newcastle.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13407559/benjamin-sesko-transfer-news-rb-leipzig-forward-prefers-man-utd-bid-to-newcastle-approach,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 23:57:00",,['Manchester United'],"Sky Sports News understands there is now a growing feeling Benjamin Sesko wants to join Manchester United over rival bidders Newcastle.
There is no club-to-club agreement yet - but Man Utd remain in talks with RB Leipzig over a deal after making an offer worth an initial £65m plus £8.9m in add-ons.
Newcastle have also been working on a deal for Sesko, and earlier on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, which was higher than Manchester United's - after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.
Newcastle have tried everything to get a deal done and their bid is worth more than Manchester United's. However, it appears the player's desire is to go to Old Trafford.
RB Leipzig are currently internally discussing and evaluating the Newcastle and Man Utd offers and their structures, according to Sky in Germany.
The 22-year-old was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker, who has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, trained indoors away from the team at Leipzig's training complex on Tuesday.
Man Utd's bid for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.
Newcastle will only let Isak leave St James' Park if they can bring in a ready-made replacement.
Liverpool had a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected by the Magpies.
Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.
Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
""Newcastle have been internally concerned that if Manchester United come to the table, Sesko favours a move to Old Trafford.
""Manchester United's offer, totalling £65m plus around £8.9m (€75m + €10m), is short of Newcastle's. They offered around £5m more.
""Newcastle have offered more up front and more in total but Manchester United have come to the table.
""He is open to both moves and it is not that he is against Newcastle - but if it came to the two, Manchester United would be the choice.
""We are yet to hear back from RB Leipzig on Newcastle or Manchester United's offer.
""It is a confusing situation. Internally, [Newcastle] were given encouragement that the player would be up for a move.
""It feels, from the noises we are hearing, that Leipzig will leave it up to the player to decide. We have not heard the last of this one. There will be more negotiations to come.""
Manchester United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.
It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.
It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.
Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.
A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.
Manchester United and Newcastle are locked in a battle for Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?
Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?
And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?

Man Utd make £74m bid for RB Leipzig striker Sesko,Manchester United make a bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko with the overall package potentially rising to 85m euros (£73.8m).,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c79l8g84p59o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 13:37:23",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have made a bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko with the overall package potentially rising to 85m euros (£73.8m).
The offer includes a guaranteed payment of 75m euros (£65.2m).
The Red Devils are yet to get a response but believe it is an appropriate valuation for the 22-year-old Slovenia forward and that he is keen to move to Old Trafford.
Newcastle United also want Sesko and have made a bid in the region of 80m euros (£69.5m) as they continue negotiations with Leipzig.
The offer from Manchester United is seen as significant as there had been suggestions they did not want to firm up their interest with Leipzig without knowing the forward was prepared to join them.
Manchester United are willing to let Rasmus Hojlund leave the club in order to make space for Sesko to come in.
Sesko has 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig and, at 6ft 5in, he would also bring a significant physical presence to the Old Trafford club's front line.
Manchester United sources have previously outlined how it is possible for them to reach an agreement on Sesko even though Sir Jim Ratcliffe said earlier this year there was the potential for the club to go bust by Christmas without massive cost-cutting measures.
Payment arrangements for the deals for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford this summer, which total £130m, have been arranged in a favourable way.
In addition, the entirety of Marcus Rashford's £325,000-a-week salary is being covered by his loan move to Barcelona and Manchester United received £5m from Chelsea after the Blues pulled out of a deal to sign Jadon Sancho.
Manchester United have also received more than £15m in payments as part of sell-on clauses involving Anthony Elanga, Alvaro Carreras and Maxi Oyedele.
Why do Man Utd and Newcastle want Sesko?
Since moving to Germany, Sesko is the top scorer currently aged under 23 in all competitions, of players based in Europe's top five leagues - with 39 goals in 87 games.
He is one ahead of Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham and five clear of Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for £100m this summer.
Sesko is big, strong, quick, good in the air and a fine finisher, and has been compared to Erling Haaland - and not just because they both played for Salzburg.
As well as being a goalscorer, last season he was more of an all-rounder, with just 9.7% of his touches coming in the opposition box - compared with 17% the season before.
He got involved more on both wings and further back into midfield.
He was one of the fastest strikers in the Bundesliga at 35.7km/h - and had the best aerial success rate of strikers involved in at least 60 of them.
Only six forwards have scored more goals in the Bundesliga in the past two seasons, even though Sesko is 16th for expected goals, 14th on shots and 22nd on touches in the opposition box.
And he is lethal from long range too, with 36.8% of his shots - and 23.1% of his goals - coming from outside the box. Both are higher than any Bundesliga striker to score 12 or more goals last season.
A recruitment specialist working at the highest level recently said: ""I think the physicality of the Premier League won't overawe him.
""The Bundesliga is one of the big three in the world, but when you look at transitioning into big leagues he has the physical capabilities to do it.
""You wouldn't expect him to hit the ground running straight away, but in six to 12 months he will be fine and you've got yourself a very good player.""

Dias & O'Reilly close to signing new Man City deals,Manchester City reach agreements in principle over new contracts with defender Ruben Dias and midfielder Nico O'Reilly.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj0yzr18zz2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:44:01",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City have reached agreements in principle over new contracts with defender Ruben Dias and midfielder Nico O'Reilly.
Portugal international Dias' current deal expires in 2027, while academy product O'Reilly's contract runs until 2028.
Sources have not revealed the length of the new contracts.
Dias, 28, joined City from Benfica for £65m in 2020 and has made 222 appearances for the club, winning four Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.
City's injury crisis last season allowed 20-year-old O'Reilly to break through into the first team, with the majority of his 21 appearances coming at the unfamiliar position of left-back.
Grealish takes part in open training session
The City players returned to training on 28 July following their shock exit from the Club World Cup in the United States.
City have signed five players this summer and are expecting departures from their squad before the end of the transfer window on 1 September.
Midfielder Jack Grealish was left out of the squad for the tournament and, during that period, he had been working individually at City's training ground.
The club invited supporters to watch an open training session on Tuesday and Grealish was part of the group that were being put through their paces.
The 29-year-old is said to be of interest to Everton but sources say City are yet to receive any offers for the England international.
Midfielder Kalvin Phillips lost his number four shirt to new signing Tijjani Reijnders is another who is likely to depart but is currently recuperating from Achilles surgery.
Sources have told BBC Sport that clubs in the Premier League including Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, as well as in the Bundesliga, are interested in signing midfielder James McAtee.
The arrival of James Trafford from Burnley means City have four senior goalkeepers so Stefan Ortega is the most likely to depart, should any offers come in for the 32-year-old German.
Meanwhile, Ballon d'Or winner Rodri took full part in the training session and appears to be fit for the Premier League season-opener at Wolves on 16 August.
The Spaniard missed almost all of last season with a serious knee injury and was substituted in the extra-time defeat by Al-Hilal in the US, with manager Pep Guardiola saying afterwards the player ""complained about his situation"".
Brazilian centre-back Vitor Reis was not involved as he closes in on a season-long loan move to La Liga side Girona.

Why did Liverpool play twice in a day in pre-season?,Liverpool joined the trend of Crystal Palace and Bournemouth in playing two pre-season games against the same opposition in a day.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn840514x3mo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:50:53",Max Chesterton,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace all played double-header friendlies as they ramp up their preparations for the upcoming season.
The Premier League champions faced Athletic Bilbao twice on Monday, giving Arne Slot the opportunity to play his entire squad for as many minutes as possible.
A total of 32 players featured as Liverpool rotated heavily between matches as they build up to the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday.
In the first game, Alexis Mac Allister featured for an hour and Darwin Nunez played 80 minutes, with the Uruguay striker finding the net in a 4-1 win.
Slot then named a different starting XI and bench for the second match as Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez and Hugo Ekitike made their home debuts in a 3-2 victory.
Fans could see back-to-back matches for the price of one match ticket, but weren't permitted to leave and re-enter the stadium between games.
A growing trend?
It's a format that has been replicated by other clubs in pre-season, with Crystal Palace playing twice in a day against German side Augsburg.
Manager Oliver Glasner said: ""I'm very satisfied with this double test. At the end of a really intense training camp, we had good tests - and taken a step forward.""
Bournemouth also played twice against Championship side Bristol City in behind-closed-doors friendlies before travelling to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series.
Opposition boss Gerhard Struber saw the benefit of the double-header, saying: ""We were able to give a lot of players minutes in that format and it was an important exercise.""

Footballer Thomas Partey granted bail on rape charges,The former Arsenal midfielder has been given conditional bail,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05engnv3l2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 09:22:12",,['Arsenal'],"Former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has been granted conditional bail after being charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.
The 32-year-old Ghanaian appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, charged with five counts of rape against two women, and a charge of sexual assault against a third woman.
The alleged offences took place between 2021 and 2022 when he was playing for north London club Arsenal.
He was charged four days after leaving Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of June. His next appearance is at the Old Bailey on 2 September.
Mr Partey was wearing a black zip-neck jumper, black trousers and carried a navy blazer as he entered court. He stood with his arms behind his back in the dock.
He spoke to confirm his name and confirmed he understood his bail conditions.
His bail conditions state he cannot contact any of the three women and must notify police of any permanent changes of address or international travel.
The charges follow an investigation by detectives, which started in February 2022 after police first received a report of rape.
Mr Partey's lawyer Jenny Wiltshire previously said he ""denies all the charges against him"", adding he welcomed ""the opportunity to finally clear his name"".
The footballer is reported to be preparing to join Spanish team Villarreal on a one-year contract, with the possibility of a further 12-month extension.

Simpson-Pusey ready to 'show talents' at Celtic,"Jahmai Simpson-Pusey is ready to show his ""talent"" and his ""levels"" after joining Celtic on a season-long loan from Manchester City.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y34gn3pgjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:56:28",,['Manchester City'],"Jahmai Simpson-Pusey is ready to show his ""talent"" and his ""levels"" after joining Celtic on a season-long loan from Manchester City.

Which football teams have met in fixtures at the most different home grounds? | The Knowledge,"Plus: offside goalkeepers, long-distance English away-days and the Charity Shield curse",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/which-football-teams-have-met-in-fixtures-at-the-most-different-home-grounds,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 07:00:49",Guardian sport,['Chelsea'],"“Port Vale have played Everton at Priory Road, Anfield, Goodison Park and now the Hill Dickinson Stadium,” notes Kevin Doran. “Is there an example of any other team having played another team at four or more home grounds?”
Philip Davis starts us off with a likely potential host: “Brighton & Hove Albion have had four home grounds since 1902. After the Goldstone Ground (1902-97), the Seagulls ground-shared at Gillingham’s Priestfield home in 1997-98 and 1998-99 (both seasons spent in the fourth tier). After 12 years at the Withdean Stadium (1999-2011), they moved to the purpose-built Amex Stadium.
“Five clubs played Brighton in what was then Division Three at Priestfield and have also played at the Goldstone, Withdean and Amex: Hull City, Cardiff, Swansea, Doncaster and Brentford. Brighton also hosted Millwall in the 1998-99 Football League Trophy at Gillingham, and at their other three home grounds.”
Ken Foster takes us from Brighton to Bristol. “Grimsby Town, York City and Portsmouth have played away fixtures at Bristol Rovers at four different grounds,” he notes. Rovers played at the Eastville Stadium from 1887 to 1996, then spent a decade at Bath City’s Twerton Park before moving back to Bristol at the Memorial Ground – a total of three venues.”
Allow Ken to elaborate: “Rovers played five games at Bristol City’s Ashton Gate in the 1980-81 season after the Eastville stand fire, and those three teams were among the visitors. The other two matches were against Oldham Athletic and Newcastle United but they never played Rovers at Twerton Park.” It was a dismal season for both Bristol clubs, as both were relegated from Division Two. Only the Grimsby game was a league match; the visits of York and Pompey were League Cup contests.”
Tottenham have called Northumberland Park, White Hart Lane, Wembley and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium home over their 143-year history – and we have dug up examples of Southampton and Arsenal having visited them at these four venues.
Liverpool Women have played at a number of different home grounds over the years and Everton have travelled for derbies at The Halton Stadium, Prenton Park, Anfield and The Totally Wicked Stadium. They may even have faced each other with Liverpool the home team at West Lancashire College before 2012.
Can any teams do better than four away grounds? It’s complicated. Wimbledon FC played at three different home venues as a Football League club – the old Plough Lane, Selhurst Park and Milton Keynes’ National Hockey Stadium in 2003-04. After being renamed MK Dons the following season, the club relinquished its claim to Wimbledon’s histories and trophies in 2006.
AFC Wimbledon, who were promoted to the EFL in 2011, claim to be the original club’s “spiritual successors” and have played their matches at Kingsmeadow and the new Plough Lane stadium, which opened in 2020. So if we accept – as the average travelling fan might do – that Wimbledon FC and AFC are essentially the same club, we can find nine teams who have played them at all five different venues.
Bradford City, Gillingham, Rotherham, Sunderland and Walsall have played league games at all five grounds. Four other teams have completed the set thanks to a Cup tie: Coventry (League Cup tie at the new Plough Lane in August 2023), Crewe (FA Cup replay at Selhurst Park in Jan 1997), Ipswich (Zenith Data Systems Cup tie at the old Plough Lane in 1990) and Wigan (League Cup tie at Selhurst Park in Sept 2000).
Another eight teams – Blackpool, Bolton, Charlton, Grimsby, Notts County, Portsmouth, Swindon and Tranmere – have played either incarnation of Wimbledon at four different away grounds. Blackpool made the cut by playing AFC Wimbledon at Loftus Road in the 2020-21 season; the team played four games at QPR’s ground before moving into the new Plough Lane, all behind closed doors.
Can you find better examples of teams meeting at many different home grounds? If so, get in touch.
The offside goalie
“We all love it when a goalie comes up for a last-minute set piece,” stated Simon Buckton. “But has a goalkeeper ever been flagged for offside – or better still, had a goal disallowed for offside?”
Thanks to the many, many readers who got in touch to remind us of a famous example. Duncan Jones was first to reply, so over to him: “Peter Schmeichel scored this absolute beauty in an FA Cup replay against Wimbledon in 1997, that was tragically disallowed. He was only off by three or four feet for crying out loud – and in true 90s style, Andy Cole was also offside for good measure.”
A long way to go
“Truro City, who begin their first season in the National League on Saturday, are going to have some very long trips,” wrote Mel Slattery. “The distance from their stadium to Gateshead’s is 457 miles, according to Google Maps. Have two clubs in England ever met who are based further apart? Competitively or otherwise.”
Andy Clark chimes in with a resounding “Yes! My local team, Whitley Bay, in fact travelled to Truro for an FA Vase last-16 tie in 2008. According to Google, this is six miles further, and all the players involved were part-time. Whitley Bay won 3-0, lost to Lowestoft Town in the next round, before winning the Vase for the next three seasons. Unlike most of their later opponents in those years, Whitley have not been promoted since.”
Chris Roe cannot find a fixture in the Football League with a greater straight-line distance between the two teams’ home grounds. Fourteen pairs of teams have faced off with more than 300 miles between them as the crow flies, with Newcastle United and Plymouth Argyle being the furthest apart.  Here is Chris’s table of all 14 games – with Argyle featuring eight times:

“As an Arsenal fan, I’ve noticed that whenever we win the Community Shield, we inevitably go on not to win the league,” asked Matt Tread way back in 2005. “Is there a curse?”
Going back to the start of the Charity Shield in 1908, only 14 teams had gone on the win the league after winning the season’s curtain-raiser. At the time of the question, no side had won the Charity Shield and gone on to win the league since Manchester United trounced Newcastle 4-0 in 1996.
Arsenal have won the league 13 times, but only three of those were preceded by a Charity Shield victory: in 1930, 1933 and in 1934. The Gunners opened the season with Charity Shield victories in 1998, 1999 and 2002 – only for United to win the title on each occasion.
2025 update: With Liverpool taking on Crystal Palace at Wembley this Sunday, what has changed in the last 20 years? Well, five out of the six winners between 2005 and 2010 went on to win the title – Manchester United (three times) and Chelsea (twice) but since then, only Manchester City in 2018-19 have done the Shield/title double. As for Arsenal, they’ve won five Community Shields since 2005 … and no league titles.

“Within 16 minutes of the season starting, Salford debutant Kadeem Harris had scored at both ends in against Crewe. Has anyone scored a quicker own goal-proper goal combo either a) to start a season, b) on their debut or c) in any match?” asks Richard Wilson.
“I recently came across one of the more bizarre footballing tales: that of Michael Reddy, a former Sunderland prospect,” begins Mark Moran. “Multiple sources (fan sites, the Northern Echo, and even Transfermarkt) claim he left Grimsby in 2007 for FC Malamuk in Greenland, then moved to Port Stanley Albion after meeting a Falkland Islander at a fish festival. Surely there’s more myth than truth to this?”

Football transfer rumours: Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott on his way to Leipzig?,Today’s rumours are counting the clouds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/football-transfer-rumours-liverpools-harvey-elliott-on-his-way-to-leipzig,"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 07:12:25",Will Unwin,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United', 'Liverpool']","It has been one of the great conundrums of this window, leaving people pontificating over what Harvey Elliott should do next. The midfielder was, arguably, the leading light in England’s European Under-21 Championship triumph but it still feels like minutes will be hard to come by at Liverpool. Many have suggested he would suit the Bundesliga and RB Leipzig seem to think the same and have got in touch with Liverpool to see if something can be worked out.
Supposedly Newcastle have a plan B if they do not land Benjamin Sesko from Leipzig, although considering they have missed out on so many players this summer, it is more like a plan T. The latest contingency walks, talks and gets booked just like Nicolas Jackson, mainly because it is the Chelsea striker. There is a parallel universe where Sesko hot foots it to St James’ Park, leaving Manchester United light of a No 9, which would then see them bid for Jackson to fill the void. But it does not end there, because Ollie Watkins could once again be back on the Ruben Amorim dartboard and Aston Villa are fortifying themselves for a bid.
One person that will certainly be at Manchester United this season is Harry Maguire, despite the centre-back being the focal point of a whopping five offers, which seems like a lot. Premier League and Serie A clubs have purportedly made bids, while Galatasaray and Besiktas are interested, not to mention Monaco and Marseille who could make a move when Maguire’s contract is up at the end of the season.
Newcastle are facing a hectic final few weeks of the window, having struggled to do much business thus far. While everyone is distracted by Alexander Isak and the subsequent fallout, people are forgetting they really need a centre-back, too. Milan’s Malick Thiaw is one potential target for Eddie Howe, who is searching for the Italian dialling code and a number for San Siro so he can make an enquiry.
Considering the fact every man and his dog have needed to sign a new striker this season, it comes somewhat of a surprise that Dominic Calvert-Lewin is still unemployed. The former Everton frontman is available for free and the latest club to bat their eyelids in his direction are newly-promoted Sunderland.
Jacob Ramsey has brought a bit of tittle and plenty of tattle in recent weeks. First, Nottingham Forest were credited with wanting to sign the Aston Villa midfielder and now West Ham are being linked with a £40m move for the 24-year-old. As he has risen through the ranks at Villa Park, any income made from his sale would be pure profit in the back pocket, which cheers up the money men.
Speaking of Forest and central midfielders. Depending on who you believe, they are in talks to sign Douglas Luiz from Juventus or are desperate to secure the services of Mads Bidstrup from RB Salzburg.
Down in the Championship, the former Manchester United defender Brandon Williams is set to return to football after a year away. He has recently been on trial at Hull City, who are keen to sign him, but plenty of other second-tier teams hold a candle for him.

Transfer trouble and boardroom bother: vexed Newcastle face a puzzled future | Louise Taylor,A summer without a sporting director and failure to keep Alexander Isak happy has left the club with an almost dysfunctional feel,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/05/newcastle-eddie-howe-alexander-isak-liverpool-transfer-analysis,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 19:00:34",Louise Taylor,['Liverpool'],"“If you want to understand Newcastle you first need to understand its place in the world – that is, a very long way from anywhere. The next major city is Leeds, two hours drive to the south … London feels very far away.”
If Eddie Howe can only hope his prospective signings do not stumble across the Rough Guides introduction to England’s northern cities, Newcastle’s manager may also reflect that it was not supposed to be like this.
The days when the club’s recruitment strategy was often a victim of its geographical isolation were supposed to have ended four years ago when Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund obtained the keys to St James’ Park.
In October 2021 there was a sense of giddiness in the Tyneside air as Amanda Staveley, the then Newcastle director and minority owner who played a key role in convincing one of the world’s richest sovereign wealth funds to buy the club from Mike Ashley, settled back into a sofa at the city’s leafy Jesmond Dene House hotel and spoke of soaring ambition and trophies galore.
Since then a series of leading players including Alexander Isak, Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimarães have signed for Newcastle, Howe’s team are in the Champions League for the second time in three years and are the holders of the Carabao Cup, their first domestic trophy for 70 years.
Rather less positively, Isak is doing his utmost to force through a move to Liverpool, a slew of big names have turned down Howe in favour of relocating to London or Manchester this summer and Newcastle are seeking their third sporting director and second chief executive in three years.
Oh and Staveley and her husband, Mehrdad Ghodoussi, are no longer around, after being ousted in a boardroom power struggle last summer. Staveley spoke subsequently of her “heartbreak” and “devastation” at that departure, insisting rumours of a planned exit were “absolute rubbish”.
Thirteen months on Newcastle’s chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan, and the rest of the Riyadh-based Saudi ownership are perhaps realising that maybe she was more important to their Geordie project than they realised. Arguably almost everything that has subsequently gone wrong seems rooted in that parting of the ways.
Crucially, Staveley and Ghodoussi were excellent communicators within a club where, at assorted levels, personal connections have since loosened and the Saudi ownership remain so remote that no representative of PIF has spoken to the UK football media.
In contrast Staveley was big on the human touch, taking time to stop and chat to players, staff and, occasionally, reporters while also sending first-teamers regular text messages as she established rare trust with the instinctively wary Howe. Maybe Staveley sometimes over-promised. Isak’s representatives certainly believe the striker was assured his £150,000-a-week wages would be boosted significantly last summer and the fallout is hurting Howe now.
Yet given that Newcastle only narrowly avoided a potential points deduction and heavy fine after scrambling to comply with Premier League spending rules within hours of a key deadline last June, the club’s decision to tell Isak he would have to be content with his current deal after all represented financial logic.
Howe’s problem was that a striker who proceeded to score 27 goals last season remained seriously annoyed. Indeed Isak, along with certain similarly sulky teammates, started the campaign badly and it took the manager’s considerable man-management skills to talk them round. It did not go unnoticed that, after the Carabao Cup triumph, Isak’s body language turned uninterested again.
Even so, the Swede had three years on his contract and there was a – misplaced – sense that a supposedly “laid-back” character would not “rock the boat”, let alone skip a pre-season tour of south east Asia, particularly as he was poised to be offered an improved contract this summer.
Instead Liverpool’s interest turned the head of a striker said to be disappointed that there is still no sign of a much-vaunted new training ground at a club where a long-awaited, and much-delayed, decision as to whether Newcastle will revamp St James’ Park or build a new stadium has again been postponed.
At a time when, given the constraints of profitability and sustainability rules, the art of selling is just as important as buying players, moving Isak to Liverpool for £120m-plus this month makes sense, permitting Howe to restock a talented but slender squad.
The real puzzle is the lack of honest springtime conversations with Isak that might have allowed Newcastle to force an auction involving Liverpool, Arsenal et al before using their handsome profit to source an elite replacement.
Instead Liam Delap, João Pedro, Hugo Ekitiké and now, perhaps, Benjamin Sesko have slipped through the net, preferring to move to London or Manchester.
Newcastle, though, is not exactly Siberia and might have proved an easier sell had the Saudis swiftly appointed a successor to Darren Eales, who announced his resignation as chief executive 11 months ago after a blood cancer diagnosis.
Eales finally seems about to be replaced by the Canadian former Real Madrid executive David Hopkinson, but Paul Mitchell’s abrupt departure “by mutual consent”, announced in late May, dictates that Newcastle have spent the transfer window without a sporting director.
Mitchell, who succeeded Dan Ashworth last July, left without signing a player after kicking off his tenure by declaring that the transfer strategy was “unfit for purpose” and the manager needed “to evolve”.
An uneasy truce with Howe eventually ensued but, less than 24 hours after Mitchell and the manager met Rumayyan for a post-season planning summit, his impending exit was announced.
Throw in the enduring silence from Saudi Arabia and it is easy to understand why a footballer’s agent might tell his client that, although Howe is clearly a brilliant coach, Newcastle look a bit dysfunctional right now. Geography may no longer be the main reason why top players steer clear of Tyneside.

Ex-Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey in court on rape and sexual assault charges,"Partey, 32, has been charged with five counts of rape and one of sexual assault and faces trial later this year",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/05/ex-arsenal-footballer-thomas-partey-bailed-rape-charges,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 11:09:18",Kevin Rawlinson,['Arsenal'],"The former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has appeared in court charged with six sexual offences.
The 32-year-old was bailed to appear at the Old Bailey for trial later this year over allegations of rape and sexual assault. During Tuesday’s brief hearing at Westminster magistrates court, he stood in the dock dressed all in black with his arms behind his back.
Partey has been charged with five counts of rape against two women and a charge of sexual assault against a third woman. The alleged offences are said to have taken place in 2021 and 2022 when he was an Arsenal player.
The chief magistrate Paul Goldspring granted conditional bail, telling Partey he must not contact any of the three women. Partey was also told he must notify police of any permanent change of address and if he is to stay somewhere other than his home for 14 consecutive days. He was also told to notify police of any international travel ahead of time.
Partey joined Arsenal from Atlético Madrid in 2020 in a transfer worth about £45m. The defensive midfielder had signed for the Spanish club in 2012 and made 188 appearances, as well as going out on loan to Mallorca and Leganés.
He played 35 games for Arsenal in the Premier League last season, scoring four goals. Partey left the north London club at the end of his contract this summer. As bail conditions were discussed in court, Goldspring said: “I understand he’s no longer employed in this country and playing in Spain now.”
The Metropolitan police said they first received allegations against him of rape in February 2022.
Partey’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, has previously said he “denies all the charges against him” and that he welcomed “the opportunity to finally clear his name”.

Aston Villa close in on £30.5m deal for Nice forward Evann Guessand,Guessand scored 12 goals in Ligue 1 last season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/05/aston-villa-evann-guessand-nice-tyler-morton-lyon-liverpool-transfer-window,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:07:46",Ben Fisher,['Liverpool'],"Aston Villa are close to making the Nice forward Evann Guessand their first major summer signing. Villa have agreed a package worth €35m (£30.5m) for the Ivory Coast international.
Villa have scheduled a medical for Guessand on Wednesday and plan to sign the 24-year-old to a long-term contract. The France-born player scored 12 goals in 32 appearances in Ligue 1 last season and scored his first international goal in March.
His arrival would be a boost to Unai Emery’s attacking options, with Ollie Watkins the only bona fide striker in the Villa squad. Like Donyell Malen, Guessand’s versatility makes him an attractive option for Villa.
Villa have had to be mindful of profitability and sustainability regulations this summer and their only other first-team signing so far is the experienced goalkeeper Marco Bizot, who was recruited as a No 2 from Brest. Zépiqueno Redmond, signed from Feyenoord, could depart on loan.
Uncertainty continues to surround Emiliano Martínez, who is thought to be keen on exploring a fresh challenge. Watkins has been the subject of interest from rivals but Villa do not wish to sell. Villa also want to trim their squad and offload fringe players such as Àlex Moreno and Leander Dendoncker.
Meanwhile, the Liverpool midfielder Tyler Morton has joined Lyon in a £15m deal. The 22-year-old, who came through the academy ranks at Liverpool, had interest from several European and Premier League clubs this summer but opted to pursue more regular first-team football in France. Liverpool have also negotiated a 20% sell-on clause in any future transfer.
The Premier League champions are well stocked in central midfield and Morton’s opportunities may have been further limited next season by the return of Stefan Bajcetic, plus the development of James McConnell and Luca Stephenson.

Glasner believes Crystal Palace will win appeal and play in Europa League,Case against Uefa demotion to be heard by Cas on Friday,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/05/glasner-believes-crystal-palace-will-win-appeal-and-play-in-europa-league,"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 19:49:26",Ed Aarons,['Liverpool'],"Oliver Glasner has said he is confident Crystal Palace will win their appeal at the court of arbitration for sport this week and be reinstated to play in the Europa League.
Palace are seeking to overturn Uefa’s decision to demote them to the Conference League for breaking multiclub ownership rules, with the appeal to take place in Lausanne on Friday. The decision is expected to be revealed by Cas on Monday, the day after Glasner’s FA Cup holders face the Premier League champions Liverpool in the Community Shield at Wembley.
“We don’t have any influence on the decision from Uefa, we don’t have any influence on the decision from Cas, so it just makes no sense that we’re thinking about it,” Glasner told Sky on Tuesday.
“We focus on what we have to do on the pitch, how to create this spirit in the group, this togetherness, this commitment, and this is what we are doing day by day. We’re waiting for the final decision, we’re still confident that the appeal will be successful and that we will play in the Europa League. But in the end, on 11 August, we will know the final decision – then we will start to prepare for Europe.”
Palace – who confirmed last month that the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, completed his purchase of John Textor’s 43% stake – are understood to believe they have a strong chance of winning the appeal. They are expected to present evidence that they insist proves Uefa’s deadline to change their ownership structure so they complied with its rules was not 1 March but rather 30 April, as well as pointing out that Textor’s departure has removed the barrier to their participation.
The American still owns the French club Lyon, who have also qualified for the coming season’s Europa League. It is understood that Textor will not be part of the Palace delegation that travels to Switzerland for the Cas hearing.
Nottingham Forest, who qualified for the Conference League after finishing seventh in the Premier League, would stand to be promoted to the Europa League if Palace’s appeal fails. On Monday, Palace were drawn to play against the losers of the Europa League qualifier between Norway’s Fredrikstad or Midtjylland of Denmark in the Conference League playoffs, with the first leg scheduled to take place at Selhurst Park on 21 August.
An article on the club’s official website detailing their potential opponents was deleted not long after being published, while Palace’s X account also removed a message about the draw.

Football Daily | Will Hearts’ army of data nerds back up Tony Bloom’s title talk?,Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now?

Despite the Scottish Premiership title race being more predictable than Football Daily at a bottomless brunch, fitba has never been short of drama. Who can forget Ross County deleting their own website, Kirk Broadfoot suffering facial burns after microwaving an egg and former Hearts manager Robbie Neilson trying to give journalists the slip as he left the club’s training ground by sending out a decoy (sports scientist John Hill) to the car park in a Robbie Neilson mask. Edinburgh, very much the second city in Scotland when it comes to football, still has one of the game’s finest rivalries between two grand old clubs, Hearts and Hibernian. Each have had their moments in recent derbies: last year Hearts’ Lawrence Shankland celebrated scoring a penalty by catching and eating a pie thrown by a Hibs supporter. In March, Jack Iredale scored a screamer to win the derby for Hibs. The post-match celebrations at Easter Road featured one of the finest ever renditions of Sunshine on Leith, a song sung with so much feeling that it left some Hibs players in tears. And who can blame them? If you get goosebumps watching that song, imagine what it must be like to come from that corner of Scotland, stand on that terrace and sing those lyrics in front of your victorious team. Magic.
The point is, fitba is far greater than just Rangers and Celtic. And this is very much the opinion of Tony Bloom, the owner of Brighton who bought a 29% stake in Hearts this summer for £9.86m. Following the club’s opening win over Aberdeen – a 2-0 victory that leaves the Jambos top of the Premiership table – Bloom was in a bullish mood as he faced the media, explaining that he thinks Hearts can challenge for glory. “If we have not won the league title in the next 10 years, I will be very disappointed,” Bloom stated. “I want to make sure that we are in the talk to win the title at the start of each season.”
We have heard this sort of patter before, a new owner coming in and telling a club’s supporters what they want to hear. The difference is, Bloom has a track record of using his army of data nerds and analytics gurus to drastically improve clubs with savvy recruitment. Brighton are now one of the best run clubs in England, while Union Saint-Gilloise, who were bottom of Belgium’s second tier when the Englishman took over in 2018, won the Belgian top flight a few months ago for the first time in 90 years and are in Bigger Cup.
The last time a club that wasn’t called Celtic or Rangers won the Scottish Premiership was 1985 and the last time Hearts won it was 65 years ago, but Bloom seems untroubled. “I understand there will be a lot of Celtic and Rangers fans, maybe Hibs and Aberdeen fans, who will be laughing and saying ‘we’ve heard it all before’,” he blathered. “I just thought there was an opportunity here to shake things up in Scotland. I think we’ve got a very good chance of at least being second this season. I’ve just got a lot more confidence of what Hearts can do compared to when I did my first press conference at Union seven years ago.”
Bloom has wasted no time in bringing in a new striker, Cláudio Braga, who (very much in the Brighton ilk) was signed from Norwegian second-division side FK Aalesunds for around £400,000. The Portuguese bagged four goals in five pre-season matches – including one in a 3-0 win over Premier League Sunderland – and already has a chant among the Tynecastle faithful: “All we need is … Cláudio Braga,” set to the tune of the Queen classic. Sunshine on Leith it is not, but Hearts fans will be getting goosebumps regardless.
