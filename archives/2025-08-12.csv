Everton agree Grealish loan - why move is 'vital for career',Everton have agreed a season-long loan deal with Manchester City to sign Jack Grealish.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13410061/jack-grealish-transfer-news-everton-agree-deal-to-sign-winger-on-season-long-loan-from-manchester-city,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 11:20:00",,['Manchester City'],"Everton have agreed a season-long loan deal with Manchester City to sign Jack Grealish.
The deal includes an option to buy for £50m.
Grealish was undergoing a medical with the Toffees on Monday afternoon.
The 29-year-old, who turns 30 next month, is a player much admired by Everton boss David Moyes and Grealish is looking forward to working under the Scot.



Everton have moved quickly to sign Grealish amid interest from lots of clubs, having been a target for Serie A champions Napoli earlier this summer.
City recognised Grealish's need to play consistent Premier League football in a World Cup year, and that was partly behind their decision to leave him out of the Club World Cup squad.
They wanted to give him a full pre-season to find the best move for him.
Grealish is now expected to undergo a medical and finalise his loan to Everton.

Sky Sports News has previously reported that the England international is desperate for more game time as he looks to force his way into Thomas Tuchel's thinking for next summer's World Cup.
Grealish has been working with a personal trainer in a bid to make sure he is in the best possible condition for the season to come.
Grealish could have waited until deadline day for other opportunities to materialise, but he wanted to get back playing as soon as possible with the aim of being back in the England squad for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.

City's £100m club-record signing has fallen out of favour under Pep Guardiola.
Grealish made just one Premier League start last season and was an unused substitute at Wembley for the FA Cup Final defeat to Crystal Palace.
The ex-Aston Villa attacker helped City win the Treble in 2023 as he played a key part in their Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup success.
If Grealish can complete a move to Everton, he could make his debut in their Premier League opener at Leeds on August 18 in Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports.
Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett:
David Moyes is a huge admirer of Grealish and thinks he could do a really good job for Everton.
That probably means using him as a No 10 rather than as a left winger, because with Iliman Ndiaye and other options they have got on the left-hand side, Grealish would not naturally slot in in that position. So that is an interesting one.
But this is a player who will be fully aware there is a World Cup on the horizon next summer, and he has not been part of Thomas Tuchel's plans as of yet. So this is vital to accelerate his career.
As things stand, he is absolutely miles off even being considered for selection by Tuchel because he is just not playing enough games.
Everybody has been talking about the fact that Jack Grealish needs to move on. Pep Guardiola offered no guarantees he would remain at the club for this season, and certainly didn't offer any guarantees about how many games he would play. It is very, very obvious from all of what happened last season that he is not part of Man City's plans.
He made just one Premier League start in 2024/25. He was an unused substitute in the FA Cup final. And that is a £100m club-record signing. So it makes sense from all parties.
It is pretty clear that David Moyes and Everton have pretty ambitious plans right now and it looks like Grealish will be pulling on an Everton shirt at their new stadium.
Everton's move for Grealish is a major breakthrough for the club amid recent frustration in the summer transfer window.
Sky Sports News reported last week that the Merseysiders had an £18m bid rejected by Aston Villa for John McGinn.
Villa consider the midfielder not for sale.
Everton boss Moyes views the 30-year-old midfielder as a priority target and is keen to add his leadership, experience, and versatility to the midfield.
There has also been frustration at the Toffees' move for Southampton teenager Tyler Dibling.
Everton have had multiple offers turned down by the Championship club for the winger.
Their latest offer was understood to be worth an initial £35m plus £8m in add-ons.
Southampton's valuation of the winger is thought to be £45m.
It remains to be seen whether Everton will follow up with another bid.

Spurs in talks with Man City over deal for Savinho,"Tottenham have approached Manchester City about signing Savinho, with talks under way between the two Champions League clubs.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13409995/savinho-transfer-news-tottenham-in-talks-with-man-city-over-deal-for-winger,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 08:27:00",,"['Manchester City', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Tottenham have approached Manchester City about signing Savinho, with talks under way between the two Champions League clubs.
There are widespread reports that a fee of around £43m (€50m) has been discussed in these talks.
Sky Sports News understands the figure would need to be higher than that for City to consider selling the 21-year-old.



City are not interested in selling Savinho, who only signed for them last summer from sister club Troyes, and it would take a huge offer from Spurs for them to consider letting him go.
Any recruitment of wide forwards for Pep Guardiola in the final three weeks of the window is contingent on Savinho leaving.

Reports that the Brazil international's exit is imminent are believed to be premature.

Spurs have been in the market for a number 10, and that search is intensifying after a long-term injury to James Maddison.
Savinho can play at No 10 but is predominantly a winger.
Spurs winger Dejan Kulusevski has previously played at No 10 when Maddison has been injured.
The north London side have also lost forward Heung-Min Son this summer after his move to Los Angeles FC, bringing an end to the captain's decade at the club.
Savinho, who has mainly been used on the right wing at City under Guardiola, scored 11 goals for Girona in the 2023/24 season from the left side of their attack, and therefore could be a natural replacement for Son.

Savinho scored three goals and provided 13 assists in 48 appearances for Man City last season.
Savinho came on as a half-time substitute in Saturday's 3-0 pre-season win over Palermo.
Savinho may find game time harder to come by at City this season following the arrival of Rayan Cherki, while he faces competition from the likes of Phil Foden, Oscar Bobb and Jeremy Doku.
Tottenham, meanwhile, are pursuing a deal for Savinho, having spent £120.3m this summer on six signings.
The Europa League winners turned Kevin Danso's (£20.9m) and Mathys Tel's (£29.9m) loan moves into permanent deals.
Mohammed Kudus has been their most expensive signing of the summer so far after his £55m arrival from West Ham.
Midfielder Joao Palhiha has joined on loan from Bayern Munich, while defenders Luka Vuskovic (£9.5m) and Kota Takai (£5m) have also joined the club this summer.

How do Newcastle resolve Isak saga and rescue 'nightmare' window?,"MOTD pundit and Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer explains why his old club have had a pre-season to forget, and how Liverpool target Alexander Isak could stay at St James' Park.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0mllyjp881o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 18:19:59",,['Liverpool'],"So far, Newcastle's pre-season has been a nightmare. There is no other way of describing it.
They have had a disastrous transfer window, missing out on every one of their top targets they went for, and on top of that they have got Alexander Isak's situation hanging over them as they get ready for the opening weekend.
One way or another they have to resolve it, but that won't be easy. Isak clearly wants to leave St James' Park and join Liverpool, but he cannot be sold if they don't get anyone in to replace him.
It's not just one new striker Newcastle need, either. Callum Wilson moved on earlier in the summer so the reality is that if they don't get two centre-forwards in, Isak does not go anywhere.
That is still a possible scenario and, if he is still at Newcastle when the window closes at the start of September, things get interesting because he will want to play - he could be playing for his World Cup place with Sweden at next summer's finals.
There are a lot of ifs, buts and maybes surrounding Isak at the moment, but over the next two or three weeks we will find out a lot more about how things could pan out.
At the moment, though, Newcastle's priority is Saturday and their trip to Aston Villa.
I feel for manager Eddie Howe and the rest of the players who are having to deal with all the noise around this when it is not their fault, and Isak is not going to be with them for that game - which is really disappointing.
'Liverpool are never going to get Isak for £110m'
This summer should have been a time for Newcastle to really kick on after last season, following the highs of claiming their first domestic trophy for 70 years and then qualifying for the Champions League.
I don't know how or why it has been allowed to happen, but right now it feels like much of that momentum has been lost.
Newcastle went into the summer with no chief executive or sporting director, which I find amazing. They knew Darren Eales was stepping down as chief executive last September - 11 months ago - and Paul Mitchell left as sporting director at the end of June.
I don't know why they haven't appointed anyone yet or if that has hindered them in the transfer market, because I am not inside the club, but from the outside it is not a good look. It's a mess, and it begs the question about who has been making the big decisions.
Now they have to deal with Isak as well. There are two sides to every story and we haven't heard from Isak yet, or anyone inside his camp, other than him saying he wants to explore his options.
We don't know when he told the club that, how he told them, or what his feelings are about exactly why he wants out. What we do know is that Liverpool have offered £110m for him.
In recent years we have seen Enzo Fernandez, Declan Rice and Jack Grealish go for around £100m so, if that is the bar, they are never going to get Isak - a 25-year-old striker who has scored 44 Premier League goals across the past two seasons - for £110m. I don't think you'd get Dan Burn for that, to be honest.
Newcastle have named their price, which is nearer to £150m, so we will have to see what Liverpool do next. The top and bottom of it is that if Newcastle don't get the money they want, or the two strikers they need, then Isak stays.
Why Wissa and Watkins would be a good fit
I am not angry about the way Isak has behaved, because I know how football works. I'm disappointed and surprised that this is happening now, but I have been in the game long enough to understand why we have got to this point.
It seems obvious that Liverpool have got into him, or his agent, to turn his head and make him want to go there. From a players' perspective, rather than a fan, I get the mentality where he has made his mind up about what is best for his future too.
But it is the club that matters most here and, whatever happens next, the crux of the matter is that Newcastle United are far bigger than any one individual - it always has been, and always will be.
Players move on all the time, and do what they have to do, but the club is always there. That's the one constant, every season.
So, Newcastle have to look after themselves, which means that if they are contemplating letting Isak go for whatever price they want for him, then they also need to get two strikers they want in before they can do that.
If they are available, Brentford's Yoane Wissa and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins are proven Premier League strikers and probably the best-case scenario from Newcastle's point of view.
At the same time, I appreciate fans of those clubs won't like their centre-forwards being linked with moves away, the same way Newcastle supporters feel right now.
Wissa's situation, in particular, sounds very similar to Isak's. It just shows you that this is something that happens in football all the time, and of course it is frustrating when you are on the wrong end of it.
How will other new strikers settle in?
It is very difficult to predict what Newcastle's season could look like until Isak's future is sorted out, but it could still be a very good one.
They have got one of, if not the best, midfields in the country, they are really strong in wide areas and it looks like they are signing another centre-half in AC Milan's Malick Thiaw.
So, looking at the bigger picture, whether Isak stays or goes and they can bring two quality strikers in, they have still got a very good team.
Even so, I am still not sure they would be able to improve on last season's fifth-place finish. Last season's top four have done so much good business and gone so big in the transfer market, it is going to be extremely difficult for any of the chasing pack to break into those places, not just Newcastle.
In terms of the title I see Liverpool as favourites, even without Isak. You just have to look at what they did last season, and how they won the title at a canter.
They have seen Trent Alexander-Arnold leave, and tragically lost Diogo Jota, but have spent heavily to strengthen their squad and won't be distracted by having any stars coming to the end of their contract. Who knows what they might do under Arne Slot if they got another forward as good as Isak is, too.
Arsenal finally have an out-and-out striker in Viktor Gyokeres and will believe that, after three successive second places, he can get them over the line in a title race. Their top scorer in the Premier League last season was Kai Havertz with nine goals, so that tells you what they have been missing.
How Gyokeres fits in is one of the things I am really looking forward to finding out in the new campaign, and it is the same with other strikers at new clubs, like Liam Delap and Joao Pedro at Chelsea. I don't think they are finished yet in the transfer market, and their attack is already looking a lot more dangerous than last season.
The same applies with how Benjamin Sesko settles in at Manchester United. I was disappointed that he chose to go there over Newcastle, but at the same time I saw him live several times last season and he is a player with potential, rather than offering guaranteed goals.
I see what Sesko's strengths are, but £74m is a lot of money for a player with room for improvement. At 22 he is no way the finished article, but there will still be big pressure on him to perform.
With Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United have spent more than £200m on their forward line, but I still don't see them getting in next season's top four.
I think it's almost impossible for them to go from 15th to the Champions League places, even if fifth place is good enough again. Instead I have them finishing anywhere between sixth and 10th, but no higher.

'I said yes to them' - when Lewandowski nearly joined Man Utd,"Robert Lewandowski discusses the time he ""said yes"" to a Man Utd move, the influence of Jurgen Klopp and why the sky is the limit for Lamine Yamal.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0kz3xnd0e8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 05:26:41",Gary Rose,['Manchester United'],"Many football fans will be aware of the story of the volcanic ash cloud that scuppered Robert Lewandowski's potential move to Blackburn Rovers - but there was another club in England the striker wishes he had joined.
""To Manchester United I decided and said yes,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I wanted to join Manchester United, to see Alex Ferguson.""
The prospect of a move to the Red Devils came in 2012, when Lewandowski was scoring prolifically at Borussia Dortmund - and two years after a volcanic eruption in Iceland had put paid to his Blackburn switch.
However, the German club simply did not want to let their talismanic striker go.
""They could not sell me,"" Lewandowski said. ""Because they knew if I stayed they could earn more money, and that I could wait maybe one or two more years.
""But it is true that I said yes to Manchester United.""
While that move failed to materialise, Lewandowski has enjoyed a stellar career at some of Europe's biggest clubs, winning the Champions League with Bayern Munich  and La Liga twice at his current club Barcelona.
At 37 he has no plans to retire any time soon, but accepts a Premier League opportunity has probably passed him by.
Speaking in a wide-ranging interview with Liam MacDevitt, Lewandowski added: ""Maybe it could be a regret [not to play in the Premier League].
""But when I am looking back [having] played for Bayern Munich, Dortmund and now Barcelona I have to say I am very happy with my career.
""I don't have this kind of feeling that I missed something, because every move or decision... I made because I wanted it.""
'I learn a lot from the young players'
Lewandowski, who has scored more than 700 career goals for club and country, is preparing for his 22nd season as a professional.
He is now the old head in a young Barcelona team featuring supreme talents like Lamine Yamal, but the Poland international believes he still has plenty to offer.
""When I see that I still don't have to catch the young guys, that they still have to catch me, it means this next season can also be very good,"" he said.
""I am still there to show the best performance from myself.""
Lamine Yamal was not even born when Lewandowski's career began, but despite being 19 years his senior, the striker believes he is still learning from younger players.
""I understood that I cannot fight with them but I can help them and they can also help me,"" Lewandowski said.
""I learn from them a lot. I didn't think it would happen like that.""
Lamine Yamal is widely viewed as a future superstar, and Lewandowski said he could see the winger was special from the moment he trained with the first team aged just 15.
""It is the first time in my life I saw after 50 minutes that he had something special,"" he said.
""I didn't believe it because I didn't see this kind of player at this age - I thought this is impossible at 15.""
When Lewandowski came close to winning the Ballon d'Or
The latest nominees for the Ballon d'Or have been announced, and for Lewandowski this time of year will be a reminder of just how close he came to winning the award.
He was among the favourites for the 2020 edition which was cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
A year later he finished runner-up to Lionel Messi for the main prize, and was named striker of the year after a record-breaking season when he scored 41 league goals.
""I was in the best moment of my career, I won everything with my club,"" he said.
""I think the difficult thing with that case is until now I don't know why.""
On who could win it this year, Lewandowski added: ""You have so many players now who can [win the Ballon d'Or].
""Lamine Yamal's season was incredible but in the end it depends what is most important. He still has a lot of time, if not this year maybe next year.
""Raphinha also had an amazing season. We have players who can be one of the favourites to win this kind of title.""
The conversation that changed Lewandowski's career
Lewandowski has played under some leading managers during his career and is currently working under Hansi Flick, who was also in charge during his trophy-laden spell at Bayern Munich.
But it is former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp - who Lewandowski played under at Dortmund - who had the biggest influence on the striker.
""When I moved to Dortmund I was a very young guy, I lost my father when I was 16,"" he said.
""I for sure was a boy who was more closed, I didn't want to speak about my emotion.
""However, after a few years I met someone who I don't want to say was like a father but similar.
""Maybe after so many years the kind of conversation that I missed with my father, I had with Jurgen.
""I remember the conversation until now because it changed my life, it changed my football life. I put my emotion out, I put out the words I had kept in for a few years and after this I felt freedom.
""Maybe because of this I started to play better and better.""

Everton agree loan deal for Grealish - why Man City dream turned sour,Everton agree a season-long loan deal to sign winger Jack Grealish from Manchester City.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp8zjrnw6yro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 13:41:10",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Everton have agreed a season-long loan deal for Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.
The 29-year-old has fallen out of favour at City and was left out of their squad for the final Premier League game of last season at Fulham as well as the Club World Cup in the United States.
Sources have told BBC Sport that the clubs have reached an agreement over a deal for Grealish, who reportedly earns £300,000 a week, external at City, and a medical is imminent.
The England playmaker joined City from Aston Villa for what was a British record fee of £100m in August 2021 and has made more than 150 appearances, winning three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.
But he made only seven league starts last season as City ended the season without winning a major trophy.
He was left on the bench by manager Pep Guardiola during the FA Cup final defeat by Crystal Palace, with Argentine teenager Claudio Echeverri being given a debut instead.
In June it was understood Grealish wanted a clean break and a permanent new home, but he now seems poised for a loan move.
He would have preferred to join a team in the Champions League, but no offer has yet been made by the likes of Newcastle United or Tottenham Hotspur.
A move to Everton does not present the opportunity of playing European football but it will give him the chance to rejuvenate his career and take centre stage at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium.
Grealish will also be aiming to win his place back in the England squad after saying last summer he was ""heartbroken"" by being left out of the Three Lions squad for the 2024 European Championship.
Grealish's diminishing role for City
Noel Sliney, BBC Sport:
It has been a chastening two years for Jack Grealish, since he enjoyed the most successful season of his career.
He had played an integral role in Manchester City's historic Treble in 2022-23, starting the FA Cup final and every one of their seven knockout ties as the club won the Champions League for the first time.
Only six outfield City players spent more time on the pitch than Grealish in the Premier League too.
A hamstring injury halted his momentum early in 2023-24, which the England playmaker ended with more yellow cards (seven) than combined goals and assists (six) across all competitions.
He featured in just 40% of the total minutes played by City despite being in the squad for 82% of them.
His involvement dropped to 30% last term as Grealish's career plummeted to its nadir. Three of his six starts after Christmas came against lower-league opposition in the FA Cup, while 16 starts in total is his fewest in a campaign since he was 20 years old.
Unsurprisingly, it has also been his least productive season in terms of chances created and dribbling success since returning to the Premier League in 2019.
City's team structure has seldom afforded Grealish the license to take on and glide past opponents as he did with such insouciance as the talismanic captain at boyhood club Aston Villa.
The question now is whether the affable 29-year-old can reverse the downward trajectory of his career.
Can Grealish become main man again?
Grealish has grown more accustomed to sitting on the bench than playing football in recent times so his first task will be to get himself physically and mentally ready to play many more minutes of football than he has for the past two seasons.
Everton were rejuvenated following the appointment of Moyes in January, climbing up the table to finish 13th, but have struggled to build on that momentum with significant recruitment this summer.
Grealish will be a marquee signing as the club count down to their first season at their magnificent new Hill Dickinson Stadium.
England boss Thomas Tuchel has shown with his selections of players such as Marcus Rashford and Kyle Walker that he is not afraid to pick those that are out of favour at their clubs.
That will provide Grealish with hope that the England door has not been fully closed in a World Cup year.
Recapturing his form could well take him across the Atlantic next summer - but if that proves elusive it will likely bring about more disappointment for him when an England tournament squad is announced.
The ball, therefore, will firmly be in Grealish's court at Everton.
The highs...
Grealish said it was a ""dream come true"" when he became Britain's first £100m player by joining City from Aston Villa in August 2021.
He had been the undoubted star at Villa, coming through the academy to become a free-spirited maverick that helped the team to promotion from the Championship and re-established them in the Premier League.
In his first season at City, Grealish played 26 top-flight games, scoring three goals and providing three assists as they edged out Liverpool by a solitary point to claim the title again.
But the following season is when he really hit his stride, playing an integral role as City finally lifted the holy grail of the Champions League, as well as their third league title on the bounce and the FA Cup.
Grealish played 50 matches in all competitions, netting five times and providing 11 assists - his importance to the side highlighted by the fact he started all seven of their knockout ties in Europe.
""The main thing now is I feel loved,"" Grealish said during that season. ""I feel the manager really trusts me.""
He was the face of City's celebrations following their return home from Istanbul with the European trophy and it was anticipated he would kick on again, but his career has since taken an unexpected downward trajectory.
The lows...
Grealish knuckled down after he and team-mate Phil Foden were warned about their conduct by Guardiola having been pictured on a night out in December 2021.
He had a hamstring injury in the 2023-24 campaign and made just 10 starts in all, often overlooked for the quicker and more direct Jeremy Doku when he did regain full fitness.
He ended that season with more yellow cards (seven) than combined goals and assists (six) and featured in just 40% of the total minutes played by City.
Grealish has won 39 England caps but was left out of the Three Lions' squad for the 2024 European Championship, where they were edged out in the final by Spain.
Several people close to the player had told BBC Sport its impact on him should not be underestimated and it had made a ""real difference to his confidence"".
That appeared to be the case, because it did not get any better last term.
There was a further warning from Guardiola, who said in January: ""Do I want the Jack that won the Treble? Yeah I want it, but I try to be honest with myself for that. They have to fight.""
In fact, his involvement with the side for last season dropped to 30%, while 16 starts in total is his fewest in a campaign since he was 20 years old - and as a result, unsurprisingly it was his least productive season since 2019.
Former England winger Theo Walcott has suggested Grealish's ""incredible talent"" had been ""coached out of him"", but others close to the player disagreed that the manager had in some way drilled the creativity out of him.
Grealish's days were clearly numbered when he was excluded from City's final game of the season at Fulham, despite Guardiola giving an impassioned defence afterwards by saying his large squad means he has to leave out ""five or six players"" and that it was ""nothing personal with Jack"".
But he was also dropped from City's squad for the Club World Cup in the United States in the summer, instead working individually at the training ground in Manchester.
During an open training session on 5 August, Grealish was fully engaged in the tactical sequences and did not give off any vibes of a player that wanted to leave.
There has been no public falling out between Grealish and Guardiola, but after the disappointments of the last two seasons, the chance to drag his career back on track with the Toffees is surely one he will relish.

Should City obtain a fee in that region, the club would make a substantial profit on a player they signed from French club Troyes for £30.8m just a year ago.
Savinho was a regular under Pep Guardiola last season, scoring three times in 48 appearances across all competitions.
But City signed France winger Rayan Cherki from Lyon in a £30m deal this summer, which could limit Savinho's opportunities at the Etihad.
Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank is keen to bolster his attacking options after Son Heung-min was sold to Major League Soccer side LAFC last week.
Mohammed Kudus arrived in a £55m deal from West Ham earlier this summer, while the club failed to secure a £60m deal for Nottingham Forest playmaker Morgan Gibbs-White.
Spurs' need for attacking reinforcements has been heightened since midfielder James Maddison was ruled out for the majority of the upcoming season with a knee injury.
The England international sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear during a pre-season friendly draw against Newcastle United in Seoul, South Korea, earlier this month.
Where would Savinho fit in at Spurs?
After scoring nine league goals as Girona finished third in La Liga in the 2023-24 season, Savinho managed just one in his debut Premier League campaign.
That wasn't for the want of trying - only Erling Haaland and Kevin de Bruyne had more attempts on goal for City. But a lack of ruthlessness resulted in the Brazilian underperforming his expected goals total by four, the worst figure of any Premier League player last term.
However, the 21-year-old did offer plenty of creativity, registering eight top-flight assists, more than any of his team-mates. His tally of 46 chances created was the club's third highest, while he also showcased his ability to run at opposition defenders, attempting 102 dribbles - second only to Jeremy Doku among City players.
Tottenham are well stocked in wide areas despite the departure of Son Heung-min, with four players - Mohammed Kudus,  Wilson Odobert, Mathys Tel and Brennan Johnson - likely to compete for two starting spots in Thomas Frank's 4-2-3-1 formation.
But they are short of attacking midfielders - Maddison will take a long time to recover from his ACL injury, while Dejan Kulusevski is recovering from a long-term patella issue.
Savinho, who is left footed, made two-thirds of his league appearances for City on the right, while he predominantly played for Girona on the left. While there seems little prospect of him being deployed centrally by Spurs, his arrival could free up Mohammed Kudus to play there. Kudus, who has impressed in pre-season, was occasionally used as a number 10 by West Ham and also has experience in that role for Ajax and Ghana.

Spurs open Eberechi Eze talks as they try to beat Arsenal to Crystal Palace attacker,Arsenal have been ahead but want to make sales first,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/spurs-open-eberechi-eze-talks-arsenal-crystal-palace,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 07:48:22",Jacob Steinberg,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Tottenham have opened talks over a move for Eberechi Eze and are pushing to beat Arsenal to the Crystal Palace attacker.
Eze, whose £68m release clause expires on Friday, is the subject of a tussle between the north London rivals. Arsenal have been leading the race for the England international but are yet to send an offer to Palace. They have indicated they need to make sales in attack before pressing ahead with their pursuit of Eze.
The delay from Arsenal, who are looking for buyers for Leandro Trossard, has opened the door for Spurs to act on their longstanding interest. Thomas Frank, the new Spurs manager, needs attacking additions after losing James Maddison to a long-term knee injury and missing out on the signing of Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White. They can offer Champions League football to Eze after winning the Europa League last season.
An agreement is yet to be reached, though, and Spurs do not intend to meet Eze’s clause. A further complication for Spurs is that Arsenal are believed to be the 27-year-old’s favoured destination should he leave Palace.
Arsenal, who have bolstered their attack with the additions of Victor Gyökeres and Noni Madueke, have shown ambition this summer as they look to win the title for the first time since 2004. They have spent close to £200m and would like to shift unwanted players. Trossard has fallen down the pecking order in attack and Fábio Vieira has no future at the club.
Arteta is understood to have identified Eze as a player capable of giving Arsenal an extra edge against deep defences. Creativity was a problem for the Spaniard’s team last season. Their hopes of keeping up with Liverpool foundered on a chronic lack of ruthlessness, causing them to draw too many winnable games.
Palace, who have lost their appeal to be reinstated to the Europa League, will hope to hold on to their best attacker. Eze, who hopes to earn a spot in England’s squad for next summer’s World Cup, scored the winner in last season’s FA Cup final and has developed into one of the league’s most dangerous talents.
Palace are trying to sell Marc Guéhi to avoid losing the defender for nothing next summer when his contract expires. He is a target for Liverpool.

‘Perfect modern player’: Hugo Ekitiké has all the attributes to thrive at Liverpool,Frenchman’s display of natural ability during spells in Denmark and Germany is a positive indicator for his move to Anfield,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/hugo-ekitike-attributes-to-thrive-at-liverpool,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 07:00:15",Will Unwin,['Liverpool'],"Hugo Ekitiké is a £79m striker who has swapped the Bundesliga for the Premier League champions and is preparing to test himself against the best defenders in England and Europe. Four years ago, he was struggling to make the breakthrough at his boyhood club Reims and was sent on loan to Denmark to learn about football and himself.
Ekitiké arrived as an 18‑year‑old in the city of Vejle in January 2021 to join a club primed for a relegation battle, a world away from what he can expect at Liverpool. Although a naturally confident person, he took time to settle into life away from home. But it was quickly apparent Ekitiké possessed natural ability and electrifying pace with which to torment teammates in training and excite his manager. First, though, he needed to get up to speed with the Danish league and began with a cameo off the bench in a goalless draw against Aarhus.
“We put him on for the final 10 minutes as a striker and he didn’t play very well, but that is normal,” the former Vejle head coach Constantin Galca says. “You need a little time to adapt to the team. But the next game we put him left-wing. We saw before in the clips of him that he had good control, good speed. Before he was playing more as a striker, but we thought he would be dangerous on the wing. He’s a perfect player for modern football because he has all the attributes: pace, skill, physicality and finishing.”
Ekitiké showed for Liverpool on Sunday, in the Community Shield against Crystal Palace, why Galca thought he would be an asset on the wing. Although he started as the central striker, he cut in from the left and curled the ball into the corner for the opener. If Alexander Isak arrives from Newcastle in the next few weeks it could be a useful option for Arne Slot.
At Vejle, Ekitiké’s naivety was as obvious as his talent and he had to bide his time. It was almost two and a half months, during which he made four substitute appearances, before Ekitiké was given a start, at Odense.
“Denmark is a hard place to move to in winter for anyone,” Galca says. “The days are short, the nights are long and it is very cold. But step by step, he spoke a little more. He became more settled in the environment and got to know his teammates.
“He worked very hard every day and earned the confidence of his teammates. He was very smart, learning and adapting to our philosophy very quickly.”
Ekitiké became a big part of the dressing room. When the music played he was first up to dance, trying to encourage his more conservative Danish teammates to join in. He is remembered at the club for an infectious smile and was embraced, despite the pleasure he took in humiliating more experienced colleagues in training with his quick feet and dribbling prowess.
At Reims the following season Ekitiké was better equipped to deal with everything. He scored 10 Ligue 1 goals and in July 2022 Paris Saint-Germain took him on loan before making the deal permanent a year later for €35m. He was transferred to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2024 for just under half that.
Considering the figures for which the 23-year-old has been sold, it is surprising he is yet to make his full international debut, even allowing for the talent at France’s disposal. The clubs have, in essence, paid for potential and Liverpool feel that if he continues at the same rate of progression he will become one of the world’s leading marksmen. He scored 15 times in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season.
“It doesn’t matter if he played facing or with his back to the goal, he always had a solution, regardless of the situation, whether he was close to goal or further back up the pitch,” Galca says. “It proved he had good quality, because it is difficult to think of the solution before receiving the ball and then play fast when you get it.”
Galca often used Ekitiké as a winger. The player’s key contributions in the battle for survival included scoring twice in a crucial victory over Horsens and once in a draw with Odense. The trick for Galca was getting him to use his skills at the right time.
Galca is head coach at Rapid Bucharest after an eclectic coaching journey and follows Ekitiké’s progress closely. He spent most of his playing days in Spain and won 68 caps for Romania. During a spell managing Espanyol he had a young Marco Asensio on loan from Real Madrid.
“Marco was similar, playing at a very high level, but Ekitiké has more quality one against one,” he says. “He works harder, he has better physical condition … He would always score more goals because he is the better finisher.”
Vejle offered Ekitiké a grounding and an understanding of a different football world. He was smart enough to seize it and has taken this attitude to Anfield.

Premier League 2025-26 preview No 13: Manchester City,"Squad will need to adapt quickly to Pep Guardiola’s evolutionary tactics, while a battle looms between James Trafford and Ederson for the No 1 jersey",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/premier-league-2025-26-preview-no-13-manchester-city,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 23:01:05",Will Unwin,['Manchester City'],"Guardian writers’ predicted position: 3rd (NB: this is not necessarily Will Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)
Last season: 3rd
Prospects
Plenty of money, about £300m, has been spent over the past eight months to get City back on track after a disastrous season by their standards. They finished a distant third and lost the FA Cup final, leaving them trophyless. The latest crop of incomings got a brief taste of life under Pep Guardiola at the Club World Cup and all showed promise. After Rodri missed most of last season, it feels as if his fitness will decide the fate of the team. If Guardiola can get him back to his best – and keep him fit – after a horrible injury, then City can feel excited once again.
Guardiola has indicated City need to adapt to the evolution of football, having struggled with the increase in physicality and fitness that has blunted their skills. There could be a greater emphasis on dribbling past opponents to try to open up the spaces. Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, Jérémy Doku and Savinho will be extremely important in a post-Kevin De Bruyne world. City struggled more than ever when it came to breaking down teams last season and Guardiola felt his team were unable to cope with the physicality of others.
It will be interesting to see who gets the nod in goal on the opening weekend. Ederson has been Guardiola’s No 1 for years, but the arrival of James Trafford could change that. The Brazilian has redefined the position and Trafford, a former City academy player, is part of a new generation who followed his strategy and have attempted to replicate his ability to distribute the ball short and long. Trafford is young and not the finished article, but he has all the qualities to be a world-class goalkeeper for years to come.
At the other end, Erling Haaland will be as dangerous as always, with fitness the only question mark hanging over him after some disruptions. Unlike this time last year, Guardiola has a second striker he can all upon if needs be in Omar Marmoush. The Egyptian was integral in reigniting City’s season after arriving in January and should be fully settled, giving them extra dimensions.
The manager
Pep Guardiola took last season personally, upset with himself for failing to arrest the slide and irritated by underperforming players. He will not accept a similar showing this season, especially after the sizable outlay on reshaping the squad. Guardiola overhauled his coaching staff, with the most eye-catching appointment being Jürgen Klopp’s former No 2 Pep Ljinders, who joins as an assistant coach. The change in personnel will bring new ideas, something Guardiola was seeking as he sought a refresh on the pitch and in the dugout.
Off-field picture
Those pesky charges just will not go away for Manchester City and the Premier League. It feels as if this situation has dragged on since Adam was a lad and rivals will continue to use it as a stick to beat the club with, while City plead innocence and claim a witch-hunt. No one is satisfied with the state of affairs and everyone will want finality as soon as possible because it is a constant distraction. A freeze on ticket prices brought some goodwill after lengthy criticism of the club’s desire to squeeze every penny they could out of supporters.
Star signing
It is a positive that City finally have a proper left-back in Rayan Aït-Nouri, but Rayan Cherki is the more exciting acquisition. The 21-year-old has been linked with top clubs since his teenage years, but City finally got their hands on Lyon’s attacking midfielder, who falls into the maverick category. He dribbles, creates and scores goals, while also possessing the ability to produce the unpredictable with the ball at his feet, and he can play in numerous positions behind a striker. It is hard to predict what he will do next, which will concern defenders. In an era when football is prescribed, Cherki can be the rule breaker.
Stepping up
A year ago, Oscar Bobb scored in the Community Shield to signal he was about to break out. He had enjoyed a great pre-season and Guardiola was confident in his qualities. The highly rated Bobb was the reason City were happy to part with Cole Palmer, thinking they had someone who could surpass him in their ranks. Unfortunately for Bobb, he broke a leg in training and required a lengthy rehabilitation period, taking longer than anyone expected, meaning he made three Premier League appearances, all as a substitute. There is greater competition in the positions he wants to play, but given a chance he could be a star turn.
A big season for …
By his own admission, 2024-25 did not live up to Phil Foden’s high standards. From claiming the Professional Footballers’ Association’s player of the year award for the previous season, Foden dropped off dramatically. He attributed the problems on the pitch to various factors, including facing challenges “off the pitch mentally” and it is understandable that those affected his ability to perform. The 25-year-old is a generational talent, possessing everything his manager wants in a player, and he will be desperate to show it. Given the correct freedom, he should be the man leading the latest incarnation of Guardiola’s football and a new era at City.

Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid’s Rodrygo to join Manchester City?,Today’s rumours quibbles with their valuation,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrids-rodrygo-to-join-manchester-city,"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 07:44:40",Daniel Harris,"['Manchester City', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Pep Guardiola is the foremost football genius of his generation, revolutionising the game with imaginative tactics such as having the best players and the most money. But he has a particular expertise when it comes to wingers: consider Jack Grealish, now binned to Everton; Savinho, in the process of being binned to Spurs; Jérémy Doku, once fun, now ineffective; Julián Alvarez, binned to be brilliant at Atlético Madrid; Ferran Torres, binned after two seasons; Nolito, binned to Sevilla after a season; all acquired for a combined total of roughly £234.4m.
Consequently, one can only imagine Rodrygo’s excitement at the prospect of joining Manchester City from Real Madrid, who have decided that, though he offers goals, assists, energy, effort, experience, selflessness, variety, balance and big-game performances, he simply isn’t famous enough or attention-seeking enough to remain part of their squad. They value him at £87m – or, if he moves to the Etihad, £29.99 in two years’ time.
None of this is to decry Guardiola’s expertise when it comes to midfielders: in other City news, James McAtee is the latest to be deemed sub-par, following Cole Palmer, Morgan Rogers and Roméo Lavia out of the club. Nottingham Forest are close to agreeing a deal for the 22-year-old and, having paid £52m for Anthony Elanga, expect the price to be somewhere in the region of £9067m; Matheus Nunes, Nico González and Matteo Kovacic are all expected to remain in situ.
Elsewhere Chelsea are, of course, in the market. They are contemplating a bid for Piero Hincapié, the Bayer Leverkusen centre-back, but any move may be affected by their apparent antipathy towards Newcastle. Having already deprived them of João Pedro and Liam Delap, they are now trying to give Liverpool £43m for Ibrahima Konaté because, as last season proves, a frequently injured and inattentive defender is a mark of champions. Though this profile would need replacing, Arne Slot might well repurpose some loot for the acquisition of Alexander Isak, who will only contemplate reintegrating or signing a new contract if he is informed there is no prospect of a move to Anfield.
Meantime, the feelgood story of the summer continues apace as Eddie Howe seeks a centre-forward, any centre-forward, prepared to play for him. As such, Newcastle are talking to Rennes about Arnaud Kalimuendo … but so too are Brentford, whose negotiations are the more advanced. Stay tuned for yet more heartwarming hilarity.
Howe is also interested in Bilal El Khannouss, Leicester’s attacking midfielder, but so are Leeds, while Everton, having been rebuffed in various attempts to sign Tyler Dibling, will instead try for Tyler Durden. Should he fail to materialise, they too will contact the KP Stadium, with Abdul Fatawu the target.
Down the East Lancs Road and to Old Trafford where, holding a placard reading “I AM THE TRUTH”, Rasmus Højlund has chained himself to the Manchester United team bus; shortly afterwards, Ruben Amorim ordered its sending to the breaker’s yard. However there is interest in the player from Italy, with Inter, Roma and Juventus joining Milan in the chase, but the smart money is on him joining his fellow reject Scott McTominay at Napoli and proving once again the old adage that when you leave United, the only way is stratospheric. Maybe they’ve got more in common with City than they think.

Frustrated Crystal Palace count cost after Cas upholds Europa League ban | Ed Aarons,Oliver Glasner will fancy his chances of winning the Conference League but the fans have been left disappointed,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/crystal-palace-cas-europa-league-conference-appeal,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 18:49:25",Ed Aarons,['Liverpool'],"The news Steve Parish was dreading arrived less than 24 hours after he basked in the glory of watching Crystal Palace win their second trophy in three months. Parish had been confident that the club’s appeal against their demotion from the Europa League would succeed as he discussed their prospects at Wembley Stadium after beating Liverpool in the Community Shield on Sunday.
“I really am, even more after Friday,” the club chair said. “I don’t understand that we cannot be in the competition. I really can’t. But it’s up to the judges to decide. We trust them and that they listened to everything we said so let’s see.”
Confirmation from the court of arbitration for sport that it had upheld the decision made by Uefa’s club financial control body to punish Palace for breaching its multi-club ownership rules has brought Parish and the team’s fans back to earth.
The Cas statement made clear the role of John Textor, the American businessman who last month sold his 43% stake in Palace to the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, was decisive. Textor has admitted that seconds after Palace’s victory against Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May that he feared the worst regarding participation in the Europa League, given that he owns Lyon, who also qualified.
The Cas panel – consisting of a Dutch former striker, a Swiss former fencer who competed in the 1984 Olympics, and an Italian professor – backed Uefa’s findings that Textor “was a board member with decisive influence over both clubs at the time of Uefa’s assessment date”. It also dismissed Palace’s argument that they had received unfair treatment compared to Nottingham Forest and Lyon, and said missing the 1 March deadline for Textor to place his shares into a blind trust had been crucial.
Textor has been the target of most Palace fans’ frustration, although several have also taken aim at the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis. Forest, who are poised to take Palace’s Europa League place, wrote to Uefa a few weeks after the FA Cup final expressing concern that Palace may have contravened multi-club ownership regulations.
Parish suggested last month in an interview with Gary Lineker that their Premier League rivals had played a role in the decision to ban them. “We were told that and I think it’s been made public,” he said. “These things seem to be played out in public. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of confidentiality that comes out of certain organisations. But we’re led to believe that’s the issue – if there wasn’t somebody that wanted to get in as a consequence, then there wouldn’t be a problem.
“People have got to look at themselves. Some people will say it’s fine, some people will say it’s not. I don’t really have control of that. I only have control of the arguments that we put forward to Uefa.” Forest declined to comment on Parish’s remarks at the time.
Palace’s case is believed to have included evidence that only members of the European Club Association were informed Uefa’s 1 March deadline for complying with multi-club rules could be extended until 31 May – a fact that enabled Marinakis to place Forest into a blind trust when it seemed they might qualify for the Champions League along with his Greek club, Olympiakos.
Palace are also understood to have highlighted the burgeoning friendship between Marinakis and Textor. The American denies that had any bearing on his conduct and described as untrue reports he is planning to incorporate his Brazilian club Botafogo into the Greek shipping magnate’s network of clubs.
Forest sent a legal delegation to the Cas hearing to argue their case and they have been silent since Palace were demoted by Uefa last month. Marinakis has resumed control of shares in the two-time European champions after they finished seventh in the Premier League.
Their supporters can look forward to the Europa League’s league stage while Palace prepare for a Conference League playoff against the losers of the Europa League qualifier between Norway’s Fredrikstad and Midtjylland. The Danish side lead 3-1 going into their home leg on Thursday.
It is estimated demotion will cost Palace up to £20m in lost revenue, given the Conference League’s league stage has two fewer games than the Europa League’s, although Oliver Glasner will fancy his chances of winning a competition that has had two English winners in its first four editions.
The chance for Palace to play in Europe for the first time since a short-lived Intertoto Cup experience in 1998, when they qualified after being the only English team to apply for entry, will be consolation for a club that also missed out in 1991 when they finished third in the First Division. Only the top two went into Europe via league position.

Jack Grealish agrees to join Everton on season’s loan from Manchester City,Forest closing on City’s James McAtee after new offer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/jack-grealish-agrees-to-join-everton-season-loan-manchester-city,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 12:42:02",Andy Hunter,"['Manchester City', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Jack Grealish is poised to join Everton on a season’s loan after agreeing to leave Manchester City in an attempt to revive his stalled career.
Everton’s interest in the City midfielder was reciprocated over the weekend with Grealish accepting an opportunity to be part of the club’s first season at Hill Dickinson Stadium. The 29-year-old wants to move in time to feature in Everton’s opening game of the Premier League season at Leeds. He is due to begin a medical on Monday.
City are looking to recoup most of Grealish’s £300,000-a-week wages and Everton’s outlay could exceed £12m once a loan fee is accounted for. City also want to include an option for a permanent transfer, although a suggested price of £50m appears optimistic for a player who will be 30 and in the final year of his contract in 12 months. City’s financial demands are unlikely to scupper the move, however.
Grealish is determined to reignite his career in the Premier League before the World Cup next summer. The £100m signing from Aston Villa, who has had several offers to leave City this summer, missed out on the England squad for the 2024 European Championship after losing his regular first-team place under Pep Guardiola.
The playmaker’s role has continued to decline since the high mark of City’s treble-winning season in 2023. He made seven Premier League starts last season, scoring once, and was omitted from Guardiola’s 27-man squad for the Club World Cup this summer.
Moyes is desperate to inject more creativity into his side. Everton have made five signings, including Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from Chelsea for £28m, but remain short of attacking options. Southampton have rejected three offers from Everton for Tyler Dibling, the latest at about £40m, and are holding out for about £50m. A right-sided forward is a priority for Moyes and Everton, who lost their fourth friendly of pre-season against Roma on Saturday, are considering alternative options to the 19-year-old.
Nottingham Forest are closer to signing midfielder James McAtee from City. A bid worth £25m was rejected by City last month, but Forest have increased their offer.
McAtee won the European Under-21 Championship with England in June, but is not part of Guardiola’s plans. He made 15 Premier League appearances last season, scoring three times, but the academy graduate has never been at regular at the Etihad Stadium. McAtee had interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, but was eager to stay in England.
Forest are also keen to add a striker, full-back and central midfielder. Regarding midfielders they maintain interest in Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa and Milan’s Yunus Musah, and Liverpool’s Kostas Tsimikas is a potential defensive reinforcement.
Savinho could also be heading for a City exit after Tottenham registered an interest in the winger. Preliminary talks have been held over the 21-year-old, who joined City from Girona last summer. It is expected to take at least £50m for City to consider selling the Brazilian. Spurs are looking for attacking reinforcements after missing out on Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White and losing James Maddison to a long-term knee injury.
Any outgoings may be followed by City looking to strengthen their options in the final third. They are understood to be considering a hijack of Chelsea’s pursuit of RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons. Chelsea have held talks over the Netherlands international, but have not made progress on a fee and want to sell players before lodging a bid.
The deadlock may open the door for City to move for Simons, who has also been linked with Bayern Munich. Chelsea have agreed personal terms with the versatile 22-year-old, but the situation is complicated by their desire to find buyers for Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson and Tyrique George before making additions.
Chelsea have plenty of depth and are determined not to panic after the England defender Levi Colwill sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury. They have options in central defence and will try to sign a new centre-back only if a suitable player comes on to the market.

"New additions have Liverpool looking rejuvenated in attack, and withered in defense | Jonathan Wilson","It was only the Community Shield, but issues from pre-season popped up again for Arne Slot in Liverpool’s loss on penalties to Crystal Palace",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/liverpool-crystal-palace-community-shield,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:50:07",Jonathan Wilson,['Liverpool'],"It was the Community Shield, and that should not be forgotten. There isn’t anybody who has been watching English football for any period of time who hasn’t made the mistake of taking too seriously a conclusion drawn in the midst of the traditional curtain-raiser, giddy on the sight of Wembley in its pomp and the return of competitive club football from the summer wilderness.
Any analysis has to be tempered. Teams are always works in progress, evolving and developing, but that is never truer than in early August with new signings adapting to their teammates and surroundings, and others shaking the summer from their legs. Things will change. But after Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace and subsequent defeat on penalties in the Community Shield, it can be said with a degree of certainty that their new signings have gelled better at the front of the pitch than the back.
Hugo Ekitiké, signed from Eintracht Frankfurt, and Florian Wirtz, signed from Bayer Leverkusen, had hugely encouraging debuts. Ekitiké and the attacking right-back Jeremie Frimpong, another from Leverkusen, both scored. But Liverpool were shockingly, startlingly open at times, as they have been throughout pre-season – and it cost them the game.
They are learning a new system, the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 hybrid of last season yielding to a 4-2-3-1. It’s not a huge shift but Wirtz, as the most advanced of the triangle of central players between the centre-backs and the centre-forward, is very much a forward, whereas Dominik Szoboszlai, who tended to be the most advanced of the central midfield triangle last season, is an attacking midfielder. It’s not that Wirtz does not perform his defensive duties – he does, and is notably assiduous in doing so, a highly effective presser of the ball – it’s that he does so in slightly different positions.
The expectation is that the midfield two in most games going forward, at least when Liverpool are not going to monopolise possession, will be Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister. Gravenberch was unavailable for the Community Shield after becoming a father on Saturday night, while Mac Allister is still regaining fitness and was restricted to the final 20 minutes. That led to Szoboszlai occupying a deeper role than usual alongside Curtis Jones, who made a convincing case for occupying the role more frequently with a controlled performance in which he completed all 53 of the passes he attempted. It was after he and Ekitiké were withdrawn that Palace began to mount concerted pressure.
Coming to terms with an unfamiliar system without the two key cogs at the back of midfield, the area that was always likely to come under pressure with the change of formation, was far from ideal for Liverpool. They had looked entirely comfortable for the first 15 minutes but then a simple straight through-ball opened them up, Jean-Philippe Mateta played onside by at least one and possibly both full-backs as Virgil Van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté stepped up in the centre. Although Alisson made the initial save, Liverpool were still resetting as the ball was returned to the middle, leading to Van Dijk’s clumsy lunge on Mateta and the penalty that brought the first equaliser.

Van Dijk looked unsettled by what was happening immediately in front of him all afternoon, often stepping into the space Gravenberch might usually have been expected to be occupying, which in turn disrupted the back four. That was what led to the second equaliser: Van Dijk being drawn forward, leaving the gap into which Ismaïla Sarr burst to score. Clearly Gravenberch’s absence made a difference but nobody should think that his return will immediately solve the problems. The new shape means a different approach, with Liverpool adopting an aggressive man-to-man press that left space behind the defensive line. Sarr caused problems all game, repeatedly dragging Milos Kerkez, the fourth of the new signings in the starting lineup, infield, which meant Cody Gakpo had to do a lot of work tracking Palace’s right wing-back, Daniel Muñoz.
None of this is unsolvable, but it does mean that Liverpool may be more defensively vulnerable, at least in the early part of the campaign, than they were in winning the league last season. Ekitiké had an excellent game, his movement and his touch, his awareness, all excellent. Wirtz impressed as well with his energy and invention; the penultimate pass he played in the buildup to the first goal demonstrating his capacity to see opportunities others would not, crafting a service to Ekitiké that took three Palace players out of the game.
But for any side making as many changes as Liverpool have this summer, with four big new signings and a fifth perhaps to arrive in Alexander Isak, there will be a degree of uncertainty, a period of bedding in. The possibilities are exciting but, as Slot reshapes the squad to his own specifications, some teething troubles are only to be expected.
On this day…
Paris Saint-Germain are by some margin the youngest of Europe’s giants, having come into being on 11 August 1970, a day after the birth of the former Manchester United and Ireland midfielder Roy Keane. The French capital had no major club which, as European competition became established through the 1960s, came to seem increasingly bizarre. So, in 1969, the French Football Federation, the mayor of Paris, the editor of French sports newspaper l’Équipe and Guy Crescent, who ran the Calberson truck company and was prepared to provide financing, got together to decide the best way of setting up a team for Paris. A referendum confirmed the scheme had overwhelming popularity, voting for the name Paris FC, and, in February 1970, a telethon attracted 10,000 people to sign up as members, each paying 20 francs.
But Paris FC had no stadium, players, coach or licence, so a merger was arranged with the second-flight side Stade Saint-Germain, creating Paris Saint-Germain (Paris FC broke away in 1972 and, after promotion this past May, will compete again in the French top flight this season). After the fashion designer Daniel Hechter took over in 1973, redesigning the kit and providing investment, the club gained promotion to the top-flight, moving in to the Parc des Princes in 1974 as Paris FC were relegated.

Premier League 2025-26 preview No 12: Liverpool,Big-money signings have shown the champions’ ambition but the death of Diogo Jota cast a shadow over the summer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/premier-league-2025-26-preview-no-12-liverpool,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 11:00:03",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Guardian writers’ predicted position: 1st (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)
Last season’s position: 1st
Prospects
Champions for a record-equalling 20th time, and by a comfortable margin, first-choice transfer targets secured in an ambitious recruitment drive and the possibility of Alexander Isak arriving too: Liverpool look in outstanding shape to celebrate their 21st title this season. A seventh Champions League triumph will also be considered a realistic target by Arne Slot.
Expectations are high at Anfield but any analysis of the club must consider the immeasurable impact of Diogo Jota’s tragic death on teammates and colleagues. It is the unknown factor in their title defence.
On paper Liverpool have upgraded the squad that won the Premier League with four matches to spare and handed Slot greater depth and versatility for his second season. The head coach rotated sparingly in the league and his approach was rewarded handsomely. Slot, however, felt that fatigue caught up with the team during a sequence of 30 matches between November and March and he should have made more changes for the Carabao Cup final defeat by Newcastle. Expect more rotation this season.
Liverpool have added pace in both full-back positions with the signings of Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong, two parts of a statement transfer window when they spent almost £300m. Hugo Ekitiké was signed from under Newcastle’s noses after a breakthrough season with Eintracht Frankfurt and the coveted Florian Wirtz arrived for a club record – and potentially British record – fee. Slot believes the Germany international will bring “a few extra weapons” to the side. Rich in attacking options, Liverpool by contrast appear light in central defence and will require another imperious campaign from Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté. The pair were a formidable unit last season. The defending champions appear the same.
The manager
There is a stark contrast between the character of the Liverpool head coach and the manager he succeeded last summer but, thanks to his tactical brilliance and calm, grounded manner, Slot exceeded expectations in evolving the squad built by Jürgen Klopp. History was made as a result. Slot made the best start by any Liverpool manager with 11 wins in his first 12 games, became the first Dutch coach to win the Premier League and joined the Anfield greats Joe Fagan and Sir Kenny Dalglish in winning the title in his first season. After the tragic events of the summer, the 46-year-old said: “To represent this club in this city now even means more to me and to my wife than it did before.”
Off-field picture
It has been a devastating summer for Liverpool after the deaths of Jota and his brother André Silva in a car accident on 3 July. The Portugal international was one of the most down-to-earth and popular figures in the dressing room, as well as a brilliant finisher who won the Premier League and Nations League in the weeks before his death. The grass verge behind the Main Stand at Anfield became a sea of tributes to the 28-year-old, who married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, the mother of their three young children, 11 days before the accident. Liverpool have permanently retired Jota’s No 20 shirt in his honour across all levels of the club and have plans for a permanent memorial.
Star signing
A certain Newcastle striker could make a late play for this title but, in the meantime, it is Wirtz who embodies Liverpool’s ambition and willingness to pay a record fee for a transformative signing. The champions beat off competition from Bayern Munich and Manchester City for the 22-year-old attacking midfielder, who also had interest from Real Madrid. Slot believes Wirtz’s creativity will compensate for Trent Alexander-Arnold’s exit and enable Liverpool to turn dominance in possession into more emphatic victories. Wirtz has looked a class act in pre-season, the former Bayer Leverkusen player’s passing, touch, awareness and ability to find pockets of space in and around the penalty area impressing.
Stepping up
With impeccable timing, the 16-year-old left-winger Rio Ngumoha shone in a pre-season friendly against Yokohama F. Marinos on the day Luis Díaz completed his £65.5m move to Bayern. A fine display capped by an excellent individual goal showed Slot there could be another option to replace the Colombian. Ngumoha repeated the trick in his next outing against Athletic Bilbao. Chelsea were furious when Ngumoha left for Liverpool last summer. The teenager, for his part, felt there was a more straightforward pathway to the first team at Anfield. He will sign his first professional contract when he turns 17 on 29 August.
A big season for
Alexander-Arnold’s departure creates an opening for Conor Bradley to establish himself as the first-choice right-back. However, any prospect of a straightforward promotion for a 22-year-old who has all the attributes for the job, and the experience of 57 appearances for Liverpool, was curtailed days after the Premier League trophy was lifted. The champions announced the £29.5m signing of Frimpong on the day they accepted a €10m package from Madrid for Alexander-Arnold’s early release. The competition for Bradley remains as fierce as ever, but an opportunity is there to be seized.

John Textor teams up with football financier in push to buy Sheffield Wednesday,Working with former investment banker Keith Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/john-textor-sheffield-wednesday-teams-up-with-football-financier-keith-harris,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 10:08:22",Matt Hughes,['Manchester City'],"John Textor has teamed up with the football financier Keith Harris in an attempt to buy Sheffield Wednesday. Harris, a former investment banker, has brokered takeovers at West Ham, Manchester City and Aston Villa and put together a consortium to buy Everton last year, although that bid was unsuccessful.
Textor was granted exclusivity in his attempt to buy Everton through his investment vehicle, Eagle Football, but also failed to complete. The American was not working with ­Harris, but they got to know each other through the Englishman’s work for Sportsbank, which this year offered Textor £230m to buy 45% of Eagle. The multiclub operation owns Lyon, Botafogo, the Belgian club RWD Molenbeek and was the biggest shareholder at Crystal Palace until selling to Woody Johnson last month.
Sportsbank, a group of investors from the United Arab Emirates and the US led by Zechariah Janjua and Navshir Jaffer, did not complete that deal, with Textor opting to float Eagle on the New York Stock Exchange. Sportsbank is not involved in the bid for Wednesday; Harris is ­working with Textor to source ­funding elsewhere.
Wednesday are in a perilous situa­tion. The owner, Dejphon Chansiri, has held talks with several potential buyers this summer and said in June that he had rejected an offer of £40m from an unknown American consortium, which is not connected to ­Textor. Chansiri’s asking price is thought to be closer to £100m.
The players have been paid late in four of the past five months, but their salaries are up to date after ­Wednesday last week received a £2.7m solidarity payment from the Premier League. The second instalment is due in January.
This week Wednesday will receive their monthly central ­distribution of £460,000 from the EFL, but short‑term problems remain. The North Stand at Hillsborough has not been granted a safety certificate so fans will have to be moved for their first home game of the season against Stoke on Saturday unless work is carried out in time. Money is so tight that some players paid for their own hotel room before the 2-1 defeat at Leicester on Sunday. As things stand, overnight stays will be rationed for the rest of the season, with day trips from Sheffield likely the norm when practical.
Textor confirmed last week he was interested in Wednesday. Harris has been chair of the Football League, a board member of Wembley Stadium and a director at Everton.

‘They have 24 months to milk the hell out of it’: will Son signing open up Asia for MLS?,"The South Korean superstar is one of the most beloved players on his home continent, giving MLS a valuable chance to raise its profile",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/son-heung-min-lafc-mls-south-korea-business-commercial,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 11:36:57",John Duerden,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"South Korean baseball fans have long been accustomed to organizing their weekends around MLB schedules – now it is time for the country’s soccer supporters to do the same with MLS.
Son Heung-min has started his two-year contract with Los Angeles FC, coming just after the attacker helped Tottenham Hotspur become the biggest club in his homeland (even if claims of close to 13 million fans are surely wildly overexaggerated) and one of the biggest in his home continent. Now it is the time to see what he can do in Los Angeles on the field and what the club can do off it.
“They’ve got 24 months to milk the hell out of it,” Sasi Kumar, a former Singapore international and founder of sports marketing agency Red Card Global, told the Guardian. “The commercial opportunities are obvious, staring LAFC in the face.”
Son has been the main man in Asian soccer for years: a golden boot and Puskas award recipient who lifted one of European football’s biggest trophies as a captain of a major club just months ago. Having one of the biggest stars in the world’s most popular league for so long was a matter of national pride in Korea and appealed across Asia. It fueled his superstardom. Son has helped to ensure that, now, pretty much every talented young Korean star wants to go straight to England’s top tier.
MLS does not enjoy anywhere close to the same stature – there has traditionally been little interest in the league in Asia, and it was barely mentioned as a possible destination for the 33-year-old. There has been a debate in Korea going back a few years when and where Son should go – a club like Barcelona was the one often mentioned. Even when the forward struggled for form and fitness last season, there were still options in Europe, where most expected him to stay. A move to Saudi Arabia was always unlikely. For a player who has never played in the K-League, going to a rival Asian competition may not have gone down well in his homeland where he has been the face of more than 30 brands. Still, MLS was not, initially, a popular choice.
“At the beginning, the fans’ reaction was divided as some wanted Son to stay in Europe and play in the Champions League for at least one more season,” said Lee Seung-mo, a Seoul-based author and journalist. “However, after Son explained why he chose LAFC and MLS, now the majority of fans understand and support his decision.” Being based Stateside also makes sense ahead of the World Cup, likely to be Son’s fourth and last appearance at the tournament.
Lee admits that not all the fans who have watched Son in England will watch him in the US. “It won’t be 100% the same in MLS in terms of viewership as the Premier League has the most fans of any league but most Son fans will want to watch MLS.”
Those years at the top of the game have made Son into such an icon in his homeland that he can transcend any competition he plays in. “His image cuts across different demographics, geography – everything,” said Kumar. “Whenever Spurs played you got Asians from all of Asia supporting him, he’s such a loveable character, you didn’t need to be a Spurs fan to like him,”

Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer
LAFC has advantages. While MLS may not be the EPL, the USA is also not the UK. Economically, South Korea already has a strong connection with the US, sending almost 20% of exports in an export-based economy to the United States in 2024, compared to just 1% for Great Britain. “The Korean market is so connected to the US; it is a huge market for Korean beauty products, electronics, cars, phones etc,” Kumar said. “Son has provided a platform and opportunity to enter the market with a huge asset. The obvious thing for LAFC is to tour Asia and they should actively look in different markets for brand and content partnerships. LAFC’s commercial team will be working overtime how to sell digital assets, image rights and work with global brands like Samsung and Kia.”
Such Korean companies have always been involved in sports (the K.League was – and, to a large extent, still is- based on corporate ownership and Hyundai has been hugely influential in the Korean Football Association over the years) and there should be plenty of knowhow on the opposite side. “What is well known about American sports in general is that they are arguably the best in sports marketing, and I’m sure LAFC and MLS both will try their best in Korean market,” said Lee.
The fact that LA have made such a big deal of the signing has gone down well. Steve Han is a LA-based Korean content lead for Fifa and host of Fairpoint podcast and has witnessed the excitement. “At the introductory press conference, there were Korean journalists who attended with LAFC shirts on,” Han told the Guardian. “⁠For years, LAFC have already been one of the most well-branded clubs in MLS. Even the contents that the club pushed out so far have really got the fans excited. The stage is set for Son to put the icing on the cake now.”

"Football Daily | Virgil v the cosmos, plus shootout ineptitude: the Community Shield delivers",Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/football-daily-email-crystal-palace-liverpool-community-shield,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 13:54:40",Soccer,['Liverpool'],"S.H.I.E.L.D
Though rumours abound that, somewhere in the USA USA USA, the Copa Gianni continues in perpetuity, Donald Trump cavorting with Infantino in front of a rapt crowd of -67, back in England, the new season is well under way. Somehow, the Community Shield – or, to give it its proper name, The Annual Curtain-Raiser – has negotiated the logistical nightmare that is a transfer window yet to slam shut, revealing a game that, in a shocking turn of events, did not encourage one to pretend that football does not and has never existed.
Liverpool took just four minutes to go in front with a gift significantly more charitable than the Shield itself: the opportunity to hear “Ekitike” said in a scouse accent, a joy perhaps even more intense than Ross Barkley saying “Lukaku”. And what a finish it was, the champions’ new striker showing exactly why a team which scored 86 league goals last season – 14 more than the next best – invested so much money in him and the also-impressive Florian Wirtz (if only they’d not conceded 41, the most of any title winner in 12 years). Arne Slot does, though, hope to address the imbalance by spending considerably more than £100m on Alexander Isak.
In the meantime, though, his team are able to rely on the mononymaniacal “Virgil” who, after conceding the penalty from which Jean-Philippe Mateta equalised, treated all bar the -67 to one of the finest sights in all sport: righteous indignance at the effrontery of the cosmos in failing to accept divinity of his will. Were there hilarious puns to be made comparing the Aeneid to a body-part, or the Iliad to an intelligence-challenging insult, we would surely dive in, but sadly there are not. It wasn’t long before Liverpool retook the lead, courtesy of Jeremie Frimpong’s fluke second goal. Palace, though, remained uncowed, fighting their way back into the contest and, in the second half, looking the likelier scorers. But just as they looked like running out of steam, Milos Kerkez – a left-back better going forwards than backwards, signed to replace Andy Robertson, etc and so on – lost track of his whereabouts, in the process allowing Ismaïla Sarr to equalise.
Palace might then have won the match in normal time, but with a cross into the box looking dangerous, Alexis Mac Allister – arm well away from his body and raised to shoulder-height – took the ball away from Sarr. Oddly, Virgil’s search for truth was less pronounced this time – likewise that of the officials – so to penalties we went, a shootout of notable incompetence failing to provoke the dignified gentlemen of the internet into a flurry of misandric rage and condescension. The Daily can only conclude they are all somewhere in America, among the -67 still rapt by the sight of Trump cavorting with Infantino.
QUOTE OF THE DAY
“After considering the evidence, the panel found that John Textor, founder of Eagle Football Holdings, had shares in CPFC and [Lyon] and was a board member with decisive influence over both clubs at the time of Uefa’s assessment date. The panel also dismissed the argument by CPFC that they received unfair treatment in comparison to Nottingham Forest and OL. The panel considered that the Uefa regulations are clear and do not provide flexibility to clubs that are non-compliant on the assessment date, as CPFC claimed” – a quick comedown means it’s Tin Pot for Crystal Palace after they lost their appeal against demotion from Bigger Vase at Cas. And beyond that they’re also looking to sell Marc Guéhi, sharpish.
FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS
Hannah Hampton’s skulduggery (Friday’s Quote of the Day) at the business end of the Euros final certainly puts a new slant on the notion of a player losing their bottle during a shootout. Buried somewhere deep down, 1% of me wonders whether she should be admonished. The other 99% looks at the bare-faced cheek of what she did, and how joyously she’s owned it since, and thinks – what an absolute, unparalleled star” – Phil Taverner.
Hampton had likely seen the [flamin’] antics of Socceroos substitute keeper Andrew Redmayne at a World Cup qualifier against Peru in 2022. As well as his stalling tactics and windmill-waving arms, Redmayne saw that the Peruvian keeper had notes of Australia’s penalty takers taped to his water bottle; names, faces and likely directions of the shots. As soon as he spotted it, Redmayne walked over, picked up the water bottle and threw it towards the stands, robbing Pedro Gallese of any advantage or insight. A beloved example of Australian sh!thousery” – Gerry Suchy.
Can I just express my appreciation for the contribution of Darwin Núñez’s time at Liverpool? His talent was there for all to see and his ability to score incredible goals from impossible situations was unfortunately dwarfed by his ability to miss the most obvious opportunities. It was his misfortune to be on the same team as Luis Díaz, who was much more successful in his similar role. I have come to realise that football is not about perfection or the expectation of perfection, despite what internet trolls would ascertain. I will miss his frustrating manifestation of the human side to the game. He did play better when he was smiling” – Nigel Sanders.

Football transfer rumours: Spurs in for Savinho? Magassa off to Forest?,Today’s rumours are awaiting the building email,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/football-transfer-rumours-spurs-in-for-savinho-wissa-to-liverpool,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 08:22:05",Daniel Harris,"['Chelsea', 'Liverpool', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","It’s been at least 13 minutes since Chelsea bought a player they don’t need and withdrawal symptoms are biting hard. As such, they’ve begun talks with RB Leipzig, the idea being to swap Christopher Nkunku and cash for Xavi Simons. Though presumably the deal wouldn’t actually be a swap, rather 793 separate deals payable over 32,321 years with the players valued at knockdown prices of £9,065m and £19,324m, respectively.
Nor will that be it. No squad is complete without someone who scores few and creates fewer, so Enzo Maresca is also keen to add Alejandro Garnacho to his squad. Leipzig, meanwhile, would like to acquire Harvey Elliott from Liverpool, who reportedly rejected a move to Nottingham Forest as he does not think they suit his playing style – they must’ve expected him to start rather than hang about as sub. Rather, he is said to favour a move to Serie A instead: the golden era of Harvelissimo may be just a few short weeks away.
Chelsea are, though, also looking to sell – most particularly Nicolas Jackson. Newcastle, having been rejected by Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Hugo Ekitike, Ian Ormondroyd, Liam Delap, Ian Olney, João Pedro, Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney and Peter Davey, seem most interested in the striker who can not strike; the player seemingly prefers Alloa Athletic, San Marino Academy and Wormwood Scrubs Reserves. But if all else fails and given how much the Gallowgate loves a No 9, the romantic thrill of following Hughie Gallagher, Wor Jackie, Supermac, Coley, Sir Les and Alan Shearer means he’ll instead accept whatever he can find that isn’t that, but if that’s all he can find, then that’s what he’ll do.
Similarly, Randal Kolo Muani, another centre-forward target, would rather join Juventus, where he spent the second half of last season on loan, while Liverpool are keeping an eye on Yoane Wissa, whom they might take should they fail to relieve Newcastle of Alexander Isak. Quite why and how all these players have failed to be dazzled by Eddie Howe remains a mystery, but here we are.
In other striker news, Ruben Amorim has packed Rasmus Højlund’s bags, put his house on the market and booked him a one-way to ticket Anywhere But Here; Højlund retains every confidence he will soon be Manchester United’s first choice. However, should his manager remain unseduced by his preference for wrestling defenders to scoring goals, Milan are interested; they’d like a loan with an option to buy, whereas United just want shot of the shot-shy.
They are, though, considering taking Dominic Calvert-Lewin on a free transfer. The out-of-contract player has reportedly dismissed his agent to negotiate his own deal, which makes sense if you consider how much spare time he has, while 13 seconds of persistence appears to have worn down Jack Grealish – he’s agreed to join Everton on loan from Manchester City, who are also trying to shift Savinho to Spurs.
Otherwise, Régis Le Bris appears to be the only person in England who has heard of Lloyd Kelly. He fancies bringing the 26-year-old defender – who recently joined Juventus on a loan-with-an-obligation-to-buy deal from Newcastle – to Sunderland, should the clubs be able to strike a deal.
And finally for today to Nottingham, where Forest have made an offer for Monaco midfielder Soungoutou Magassa; they also hold an interest in Kostas Tsimikas, left out of Liverpool’s Community Shield squad. The absence of Harvelissimo is a factor not believed to be a factor operative in their decision-making process.
