Howe: Isak's Newcastle future out of my contol - but we've had no offers,Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has admitted that Alexander Isak's future may be out of his hands amid intense links to Liverpool.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13403302/alexander-isak-transfer-newcastle-boss-eddie-howe-admits-liverpool-linked-strikers-future-is-out-of-his-control,"Tue, 29 Jul 2025 07:37:00",,['Liverpool'],"Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has admitted that Alexander Isak's future may be out of his hands amid intense links to Liverpool.
Sky Sports News understands Alexander Isak has informed Newcastle he wants to explore his options this transfer window.
Liverpool are also understood to have made an informal approach for Isak before signing Hugo Ekitike and remain huge admirers of the 25-year-old striker.
Last week, Howe confirmed that the Sweden international will not be playing a part in Newcastle's pre-season tour after he informed the club he will be exploring his options.
Isak was sent home by Howe ahead of the 4-0 pre-season defeat to Celtic last week due to being affected by transfer speculation following an approach from Liverpool.
The striker then wasn't part of the travelling party to East Asia, with Newcastle saying he was left at home due to a minor thigh issue and a long-haul flight wouldn't have helped his recovery.
Quizzed about Isak's future on Tuesday in Seoul, South Korea, Howe said:
""He is still our player. He's contracted to us. We, to a degree, control what is next for him. I would love to believe all possibilities are still available to us. My wish is that he stays, but that's not in my full control.
""We have not received a formal offer for Alex, from any club. My wish is that he stays and we see him playing again next year.""
Isak has three years left to run on his current deal, so Newcastle are said to be in a strong bargaining position and value the player at £150m.
Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
Isak is frustrated that he was denied the opportunity last week when Liverpool made an informal approach. Ekitike, who was essentially meant to be his replacement at Newcastle, moved to Liverpool instead. From the outside looking in, that was another door closing for Isak.
Eddie Howe said something that stuck out to me in his post-match press conference on Saturday after the friendly against Celtic. He said: ""I am really aware it's a short career for a footballer."" That to me is something that's likely been communicated to him by Isak or his representatives.
I think Isak feels, having been at Newcastle for three years, scoring 62 goals and helping them win the Carabao Cup last year, he has done what he set out to achieve.
Isak's development has been almost faster than the club's. I'm not saying he's outgrown Newcastle, but he's in a position where he is one of the best strikers in Europe playing for a team that doesn't really have the opportunity to win the Premier League, you would suggest.
He is ambitious, wants to win trophies and feels he should be earning £250,000 to £300,000 per week. He's not earning that at Newcastle, and he knows the other top strikers in the Premier League are earning that money. I think he doesn't want to be denied the possibility of that earning potential.

Spurs youngster Moore set for Rangers loan,Tottenham&#160;forward&#160;Mikey Moore&#160;is expected to join&#160;Rangers&#160;on a season-long loan deal.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13403096/mikey-moore-transfer-tottenham-starlet-expected-to-complete-loan-move-to-rangers,"Mon, 28 Jul 2025 14:50:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham forward Mikey Moore is expected to join Rangers on a season-long loan deal.
The deal will not include an option or an obligation to buy the 17-year-old.
Moore, who can play across the front line as a winger or a number 10, is one of Tottenham's most exciting prospects.
Spurs and Moore believe a season of first-team football is required for his development, with the player choosing Rangers despite several offers in the Championship.
The England U19 international made 12 appearances in the Premier League last season and registered one assist.
Moore also played five times during Spurs' Europa League-winning campaign and scored his first goal for the club in a group-stage victory over Elfsborg.
Rangers are also in talks with Go Ahead Eagles over the signing of winger Oliver Antman.
Reports of a deal being agreed are understood to be premature, with the 23-year-old still training with the Eredivisie club.
Russell Martin is keen to add wingers to his squad this summer, and has already signed seven players in this window.
Kris Boyd and Chris Sutton make their predictions for the 2025/26 Scottish Premiership title
Rangers will kick off their 2025/26 Scottish Premiership season at Motherwell on Saturday August 2, live on Sky Sports.
It will be new head coach Martin's first league game in charge since being appointed in the summer, and will come just days after their Champions League second-qualifying-round clash against Panathinaikos.
His first Scottish Premiership game at Ibrox will take place on Saturday August 9 against Steven Pressley's Dundee.
The first Old Firm clash of the season takes place on Sunday August 31 live on Sky Sports as Celtic travel to Ibrox, a fixture that could be key as Martin's side look to close the gap on their city rivals this season.
The sides will meet again at Celtic Park on Wednesday January 3 - live on Sky Sports - with their final pre-split meeting at Ibrox on February 28.
Rangers head coach Russell Martin is challenging captain James Tavernier to fight for his place, insisting there is space for both him and loan signing Max Aarons in his new-look side
Elsewhere, their first match against Derek McInnes' Hearts comes on Saturday September 13 at Ibrox, while Rangers face the two newly-promoted clubs on consecutive weeks with a trip to Livingston on Saturday September 27, before travelling to Falkirk on October 4.
Rangers head to Easter Road - where they ended the last campaign - to face Hibernian on Wednesday October 29, while the first clash against Aberdeen follows that on November 1 at Ibrox.
With no winter break this season, Rangers face six games in December - however, there are no games on Boxing Day. Instead, Martin's side head to Hearts on Saturday December 20 and then host Motherwell on Saturday December 27 at Ibrox.
Rangers' final pre-split fixture takes place on April 11 at Falkirk, with the league campaign concluding on the weekend of May 16/17 and the play-off final bringing a curtain down on proceedings on May 21 and 24.

Granit Xhaka closes in on move to Sunderland after £17m deal agreed with Bayer Leverkusen,Former Arsenal midfielder eager for return to England,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/28/granit-xhaka-sunderland-bayer-leverkusen-football-transfer-window,"Mon, 28 Jul 2025 15:44:34",Will Unwin,['Arsenal'],"Granit Xhaka is closing in on a move to Sunderland after they agreed a £17m deal with Bayer Leverkusen for the former Arsenal midfielder.
Xhaka has been eager to return to the Premier League and now has his wish after Sunderland agreed to pay £13m upfront for the 32-year-old Switzerland international, with the remaining £4m made up of add-ons. All going well, Xhaka will sign a three-year deal with Régis Le Bris’s newly promoted side.
Leverkusen’s head coach, Erik ten Hag, was keen on keeping Xhaka at Leverkusen having already lost Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Jonathan Tah this summer. Xhaka was also part of the side that won the German double and reached the Europa League final in 2024. He was also an integral member of the team that finished second to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga last season, as well as featuring 10 times in the Champions League.
Le Bris wanted to add greater Premier League experience to his midfield and had enquired about the availability of Jordan Henderson before the former Sunderland player elected to join Brentford after leaving Ajax. During Xhaka’s seven years at Arsenal he won the FA Cup twice and, overall, made 297 appearances for the club.
Xhaka would become Sunderland’s seventh signing of the summer, following in the footsteps of Habib Diarra, Noah Sadiki, Simon Adingra. Chemsdine Talbi, Reinildo Mandava and Enzo Le Fée. Of the new arrivals only Adingra has prior Premier League experience having made 60 appearances for Brighton.
Meanwhile, Xhaka’s fellow Swiss international Dan Ndoye remains a target for Nottingham Forest, who are working on a deal to sign the winger from Bologna. Talks between both clubs have taken place in recent weeks and there is optimism a deal can be agreed for a player who is keen on moving to England.

‘Proper England’: perfect unity that shows how Lionesses triumphed over the odds | Jonathan Liew,Playing an entire tournament with a fractured tibia is the type of undiluted commitment and individual sacrifice which carried team to glory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/28/proper-england-lionesses-women-euro-2025-final-triumph,"Mon, 28 Jul 2025 21:00:08",Jonathan Liew,['Manchester City'],"For some reason, as Chloe Kelly’s penalty hits the net and the England players explode across the pitch like streaks of white light, as Sarina Wiegman and Arjan Veurink embrace on the touchline, as England fans clutch each other in the stands, the eye is drawn to Khiara Keating of Manchester City.
Keating has not played a minute for England at this tournament. In fact, she has never played a minute for England at all. In fact, there was not the remotest possibility that she would play a minute for England at this tournament, and she knew this all along. Her entire Euros has consisted of training, travel and watching football from a hard bench. And yet at the moment of victory, nobody celebrates harder than England’s third goalkeeper.
It’s Keating who is one of the first of the substitutes to reach the ecstatic huddle of white shirts on the pitch, Keating being hoisted aloft by the second-choice goalkeeper Anna Moorhouse, Keating doing a funky dance in front of the England fans, Keating beaming behind Leah Williamson and Keira Walsh as the trophy is lifted amid a fanfare of ticker tape and smoke.
This is very clearly a triumph in which she feels just as invested and included as any other player, a triumph that is hers too, as surely as if she had saved the match-winning penalty. And as the dust settles on Sunday’s epic final, perhaps this little snapshot of perfect unity gives an insight into just how England managed to triumph over the odds.
“This team shows exactly what it’s like to be English,” Kelly said after the final on Sunday, riffing on a theme that many of her teammates have also taken up in recent weeks. And while the temptation is simply to nod along, surely it’s worth taking a moment to interrogate which part exactly Kelly was referring to. The winning? The close finish? The physicality? The fighting spirit? The calm under pressure? The togetherness? Would a nonchalant 5-1 victory with a late Spanish consolation goal still qualify?
This notion of “proper England”, a phrase first deployed after the 1-0 win against Spain in February and a recurring trope since, seems to vary depending on who you ask. “It’s that we give everything, we run ourselves into the ground,” Walsh said. For Alessia Russo it means “we’ll stick together”. For Lucy Bronze it means “if push comes to shove, we can win in any means possible”. For Sarina Wiegman, it means “passing with purpose”.
But of course the Englishness Kelly and her colleagues are referring to here is not really a dictum, far less a tactical blueprint. “Proper England” can mean passing a team off the park or lumping long balls to a big No 9 (the “Hit ’Less” strategy employed against Sweden). Rather – and much like the fluid nature of nationality itself – it is an energy, an ethos, an unspoken creed, a pure vibe. Proper England is playing an entire tournament with a fractured tibia. Proper England is Jill Scott swearing at some German who probably had it coming.
And of course the method of England’s victories at this tournament is very much of a piece with what we like to imagine as the classic English sporting triumph, from Kelly Holmes coming back from last place at the 2004 Olympics, to Jonny Wilkinson winning the World Cup with the final kick, to the pandemonium of the 2019 Cricket World Cup final. Victory is no prerequisite – there is also a solid place in the liturgy for the heroic failure of Derek Redmond and Frank Bruno. What matters is the intent, the full and undiluted commitment, the sporting equivalent of going “out out”.
“Proper England” is just the latest attempt by an English sporting team to articulate just what, exactly, makes it English. Bazball, the dogma of the men’s cricket team, is fundamentally a marketing strategy, a doctrine of spellbinding nihilism wrapped up in nonsense slogans and daddy issues. Gareth Southgate’s concept of Englishness, meanwhile, was best expressed in his famous Dear England essay of 2021, a patchwork quilt of competing influences that nobody really seemed to realise were competing at the time.
So along with the idea of sport as a vessel for fairness, protest and social justice, Southgate also appeals to the traditions of “queen and country … military and service”. This is an England of humility and passive tolerance, a quietly conservative England in which every man swears to do his duty, as long as you don’t put too many noses out of joint. Protesting against racist abuse: fine. Protesting against a Qatar World Cup: oof, bit much.

No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football
And so of course by trying to navigate the culture wars Southgate’s team ended up being co-opted into them, and ultimately resiling from them. The women’s team, by contrast, are a group far more engaged with the outside world, more urgently aware of the power of their platform, instinctively closer to progressive causes through their LGBTQ+ allyship. This matters, because even before their plane had touched down at Southend airport their triumph was being co-opted by people who believe the very opposite.
For Exhibit A, study Monday’s Daily Mail, which juxtaposed a gleeful photo of Kelly and Michelle Agyemang with the more sombre headline “NOW SHUT MIGRANT PROTEST HOTEL”. Hannah Hampton’s declaration that “we’ve got English blood in us” was feverishly seized upon by Tommy Robinson and his acolytes as proof that the Lionesses are actually a sleeper ethnonationalist cell.
A columnist in the Spectator, meanwhile, paid begrudging tribute to England before promptly getting on to its main talking points: the taking of the knee, the “foolish and irrelevant” pursuit of equality with men’s football and – bingo cards at the ready! – the usual gratuitous swipes at Labour and trans people. And once you’ve stopped yawning, there is of course an ever-present danger that an achievement this spectacular and unifying will be celebrated by the wrong people for all the wrong reasons.
Which is why it is the actions rather than the words of this team that speak to its nature. A team so evidently built on selflessness, individual sacrifice for the common good, inclusiveness and mutual support, hard work and manual labour, where an attack on one is an attack on all, where nobody is grander or more important than anyone else. A team drawn from every corner of the nation, just 4% of them privately educated, a group of women from which we can all learn a thing or two. And if that’s not proper English, then what is?
