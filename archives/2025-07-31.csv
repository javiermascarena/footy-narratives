Amorim: Man Utd look like a different team,"Ruben Amorim says Manchester United ""look like a different team"" after they earned their second victory in the Premier League Summer Series.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13404379/ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-look-like-a-different-team-compared-to-last-season-after-pre-season-victory-over-bournemouth,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 07:09:00",,['Manchester United'],"Ruben Amorim says Manchester United ""look like a different team"" after they earned their second victory in the Premier League Summer Series.
United followed up their 2-1 win over West Ham by beating Bournemouth 4-1 on Thursday morning, even without new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.
There are indications that the same players who struggled last season in the Premier League are now more comfortable in Amorim's shape.
""It was a good game. We played with intensity. We were aggressive and that is something that we need to improve from last season,"" said Amorim. ""We had better possession compared to the last game, so they are listening.
""Of course, scoring first in the beginning of the games can change the confidence of the team. We changed some positions and you feel that they know what to do in different positions.
""It was a good test. We controlled quite well the runs of Evanilson and Semenyo one against one. Luke Shaw was also really strong. So it was a good day.
""It was just a pre-season game but the feeling with the same players, even being a pre-season game, if you look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team and that is a good sign.""
Amorim also indicated that United's improvement has come from a better culture as the club looks to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, having sent Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.
Amorim said: ""More than the results is the way they are playing. They are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other, not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.
""They are stronger. They are faster in this moment. Of course, it's pre-season, but you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see that the data from the minutes are completely different.
""We are improving, but again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season, but it's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game.""
Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring for Man Utd amid the club's move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.
Amorim believes United have improved because of the improvement in Hojlund's performances.
""People focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,"" said Amorim. ""I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long]. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in support is helping us a lot to play better and we are playing better because he's playing better.
""I'm really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.""
Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola was also full of praise for United.
""We are very far right now from United,"" he said. ""They are a hell of a team. They have signed very well and today they showed they are above us in this moment.""
Sky Sports' Adam Bate:
Amorim had insisted all along that perhaps the changes that he wanted to make at Old Trafford would be easier to implement during a summer and there were encouraging signs in Chicago that the worst of his time at United could now be behind him.
There were plenty of positives in this performance against Bournemouth that went deeper than the result. In difficult conditions, United moved the ball impressively and played with real intensity and no little cohesion. In other words, it was different.
There were interchanges between Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, the latter adding weight to the theory that Amorim's system will suit him in the long term. Patrick Dorgu, having shown himself to be a useful outlet last season, suggested he can build on that promise.
This is pre-season and there are dangers in reading too much into it - particularly given that new signings Cunha and Mbeumo did not feature. But perhaps that is also a good sign. The same players looked a lot better. Light at the end of a long tunnel for Amorim.

Man Utd make move for top target Sesko amid Newcastle interest,Manchester United have held initial talks with RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13404158/man-utd-transfer-news-benjamin-sesko-top-striker-target-for-old-trafford-club-amid-newcastle-interest,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 15:53:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have held initial talks with RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko.
The 22-year-old has emerged as a top target for Manchester United in this window if they sign a striker.
Exploratory talks have also been held with Sesko's representatives and it is understood that while Manchester United are keen to sign him, it will not be a simple deal to do financially.
Newcastle United are also interested in the player, but it is thought, as it stands, Manchester United is Sesko's preferred destination.
The interest in Sesko is being driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell - he is widely credited for scouting Sesko for Red Bull Salzburg when he was 16.
United's interest in Sesko is long-standing, having kept an eye on his development for a number of years.
While the focus is clearly on player sales, United have done due diligence on a number of strikers in this window.
Talks have been held with Aston Villa over Ollie Watkins, while there was also a tentative interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.
However, the prices and structure for those players have been deemed too high at this stage.
While Sesko would cost more than Watkins overall, it's thought a more favourable structure could be struck with Leipzig.
Sky Sports News has been reporting that Leipzig are expected to use Hugo Ekitike's transfer fee as a benchmark in negotiations for Sesko. Ekitike joined Liverpool for an initial £69m plus £10m in add-ons.
Sesko has a gentleman's agreement in place with Leipzig and they will not stand in his way should an appropriate offer arrive.
Rasmus Hojlund responded to Man Utd's interest in Sesko by scoring the opening goal in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth on Thursday.
Hojlund struggled in his first season at United but boss Ruben Amorim believes his side are playing better because of Hojlund's improvement.
""The important thing I think is that people focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,"" he said. ""I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long].
""The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in support is helping us a lot to play better and we are playing better because he's playing better.""
The United boss doubled down on his praise for Hojlund when asked a direct question about interest in Sesko.
""I'm really happy with Rasmus,"" said Amorim. ""I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.""
Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford? And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?
His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.
His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.
Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.
Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.
By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.

Chelsea agree deal to sign Hato,Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign Ajax centre-back Jorrel Hato.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13401899/jorrel-hato-transfer-news-chelsea-agree-deal-to-sign-19-year-old-ajax-centre-back,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 20:30:00",Anthony Joseph and Kaveh Solhekol,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign Ajax centre-back Jorrel Hato.
Sky Sports News understands Chelsea will pay an initial fee of £35.5m, plus add-ons, for the 19-year-old.
Ajax had originally valued the player at around £52m.
Hato is due to arrive in London in the coming days to undergo a medical and finalise the paperwork on a long-term contract.
He was not included in Ajax's squad for the Como Cup final on Sunday as he did not want to risk injury ahead of his move to Stamford Bridge.
The defender fits into Chelsea's strategy of signing young developing players on low base wages on heavily incentivised contracts.
The club have been keen to sign Hato as he can also provide cover to Marc Cucurella at left-back, who played nearly 70 games last season for Chelsea and Spain.
Hato would mark the seventh new signing in the summer transfer window for Enzo Maresca, following the arrivals of Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens, Estevao Willian, Dario Essugo and Mamadou Sarr.
Sky Sports' Patrick Rowe:
Despite only being 19 years of age, the jump into the Premier League will not faze Jorrel Hato.
Still a teenager, he has played over 100 times for Ajax, captained the club at just 17 and played six times for the Netherlands.
Whenever he is tasked with stepping up, he not only delivers, he excels.
Hato is capable of playing at both centre back or left back, adding valuable competition and depth to Chelsea's backline, who are facing a quick turnaround before the 2025/26 season begins following their Club World Cup triumph.
However, this isn't a signing just to make up the numbers. Chelsea fans should be excited by the player they are securing. His rise has already been astronomical - but he is just getting started.
Latest from Sky Sports' Keith Downie and Kaveh Solhekol:
Sunderland are in talks with Chelsea to sign Marc Guiu.
The 19-year-old is available on loan and Sunderland have made an approach to the Blues.
The forward only made three Premier League appearances last season, totalling 71 minutes.

"Ngumoha sparkles, Ekitike struggles - Liverpool's win in Japan assessed",Liverpool came from behind to beat Yokohama F. Marinos 3-1 in a pre-season friendly in Japan on Wednesday. Here we examine some of the big talking points from their performance...,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13404149/liverpool-hugo-ekitike-florian-wirtz-rio-ngumoha-and-more-assessed-after-pre-season-friendly-win-over-yokohama-f-marinos,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 15:25:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool came from behind to beat Yokohama F. Marinos 3-1 in a pre-season friendly in Japan on Wednesday. Here we examine some of the big talking points from their performance...
Rio Ngumoha. Remember the name. Those who watched his cameo and stunning solo goal on Wednesday will have it in the front of their minds for days to come. This was the moment a 16-year-old announced himself as a talent worthy of storming into Arne Slot's first-team plans.
There was a sense that the Liverpool boss was trying to play down the performance of the teenage winger afterwards, talking of ""learning points"" for the rising star. But his trajectory is undeniable.
From his bravery on the ball to his technical skills with it to the pace and persistence which repeatedly took him into dangerous areas and twisted up defenders, Ngumoha showcased how he has gone from an academy talent - signed from Chelsea last summer - given a chance on a pre-season tour to a player now pushing for Premier League minutes.Peter Smith
Liverpool supporters tuning in for Wednesday's friendly in Japan would have been excited to see Hugo Ekitike's name on the team sheet for the first time following his recent £79m move from Eintracht Frankfurt, but they will not have learned much about their new striker after a largely anonymous 45-minute showing.
The Frenchman teamed up nicely early on with Mo Salah, displaying an impressive first touch, before being crowded out on the byline, and almost got off the mark on his debut with a cheeky back-heeled attempt as he tried to guide Conor Bradley's cut back in at the near post.
However, the 23-year-old largely stayed high in his role as a No 9, trying to pin the Yokohama centre-backs, while only occasionally drifting out to the channels in a largely frustrating and incident-free first period.
Ekitike was hooked at half-time in place of the man he is meant to replace in attack, Darwin Nunez, although that was less a verdict on his first-half display and more a pre-planned decision by Slot as the Reds boss tries to gently introduce the forward into his starting lineup.Richard Morgan
Florian Wirtz was given a useful 64-minute runout at the Yokohama International Stadium, capped off by scoring his first-ever goal for Liverpool to bring the visitors level just past the hour mark of their final summer friendly in Asia.
That leveller was well taken, showing great composure, although it is fair to say the club's new record buy produced a mixed display in the intense Tokyo heat on Wednesday evening.
There were some lovely first touches from the playmaker, who on several first-half occasions linked up dangerously with Salah on the right of the Reds' forward line, as well as some characteristically silky dribbles from his No 10 berth.
However, understandably, Wirtz also looked rusty at times as he continues to get acclimatised to both his new team-mates and surroundings, while the bobbly pitch in Yokohama did not help him either.
The more game time the German, who was given responsibility for most of Liverpool's set pieces, gets for the champions, though, the more we are sure to see why Arne Slot was so prepared to break the bank to bring him to Anfield.Richard Morgan
Giorgi Mamardashvili has not been shy in making it clear he has not joined Liverpool simply to act as Alisson's backup this season, and with the Brazil international forced to leave the summer tour of Asia prematurely in order to return to his homeland for private reasons, the giant goalkeeper was given another outing in goal on Wednesday.
The Georgian had replaced Alisson for the second half of the Reds' 4-2 loss to AC Milan on Saturday, but was involved a calamitous mix-up at the back with Kostas Tsimikas.
However, Mamardashvili was far less busy in this 90-minute workout against Yokohama F. Marinos, needing to produce just one excellent diving save to claw away a goalbound header at his near post just before half-time.
And that full-length stop showed just why Reds scouts were so keen to sign the 24-year-old, who was blameless for Yokohama's opening goal, before loaning him straight back to Valencia last summer, and why they also see him as Alisson's long-term successor at Anfield.Richard Morgan
Trey Nyoni warrants some sympathy, having seen what would have been his winning goal in Liverpool's turnaround victory overshadowed by Ngumoha's stunner. But his own steady progress is clear.
Nyoni was the bright young thing in last summer's pre-season. A couple of appearances in the FA Cup and a couple more in the Carabao Cup followed last season, and he became Liverpool's youngest-ever player in European competition with his Champions League bow against PSV.
Now, clearly bulked up and building experience, he looks a more physical presence in midfield. His burst into the box to convert Jeremie Frimpong's fine cross demonstrated sharpness and good movement. ""As everyone can see, he's very fit,"" said team-mate Wataru Endo afterwards. ""Today, in the last game against Milan as well, he showed himself very well.""
At this rate, it won't be long before Nyoni has his moments in the spotlight.Peter Smith
The arrival of Jeremie Frimpong this summer raised the question of whether it would be the Dutchman or Conor Bradley taking on the mantle of being Trent Alexander-Arnold's successor at Liverpool. On Wednesday, they showed their different attributes and how both can be big assets for Slot this coming season.
Bradley got the nod to start and, in possession, took up attacking positions in the inside right area. That allowed Mohamed Salah to stay wide and create for his team-mates, while Bradley was also involved in link-up moves with the Egyptian to find Hugo Ekitike.
Frimpong was among the changes in the second half and his peach of a cross for Nyoni showed how he has been such a big hit for Bayer Leverkusen in recent seasons, as was his trademark dart into the box for another crossing attempt soon after.
Against a tiring and changed opposition defence, he caused real problems. With Salah off, Frimpong operated in a wider role than Bradley had earlier in the game.
Who will replace Alexander-Arnold? Perhaps Bradley and Frimpong can do it in different ways between them...Peter Smith

Arteta praises Gyokeres' impact ahead of 'possible' debut in Spurs derby,"Mikel Arteta says Viktor Gyokeres' determination to join Arsenal was one of the major reasons why he signed him - and the striker taking Thierry Henry's iconic shirt number shows he is ""attached"" to the club.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13404145/arsenal-vs-tottenham-mikel-arteta-praises-viktor-gyokeres-determination-to-join-the-gunners-ahead-of-north-london-derby-with-spurs-in-hong-kong,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 15:22:00",Sam Blitz,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Mikel Arteta says Viktor Gyokeres' determination to join Arsenal was one of the major reasons why he signed him - and the striker taking Thierry Henry's iconic shirt number shows he is ""attached"" to the club.
Gyokeres completed a £63.5m move from Sporting CP last week, with the Swedish striker taking Arsenal legend Henry's iconic No 14, despite other squad numbers being available.
The 27-year-old took part in his first training sessions with the Arsenal team out on their pre-season tour of Asia and Arteta has been impressed all summer with the forward's mentality.
""I use the word conviction and that's the first thing that I noticed when I spoke to him,"" said Arteta in a press conference in Hong Kong.
""Someone very determined, someone that was already really attached to the club [with] the way he was talking about the club, the history and in this case Thierry [Henry's number] and what the shirt represented.
""He straight away felt it, and when you feel it - go for it.""
Gyokeres could have an explosive debut for Arsenal on Thursday in the first north London derby to take place outside of the UK.
Asked if Arsenal's new front man has a chance of featuring against Spurs in Hong Kong, Arteta replied: ""He's only done today's session and yesterday very little.
""We're going to assess [on Wednesday night] how he is and if the medical staff are happy as well with his condition to participate in tomorrow's match, then it's a possibility. We're going to discuss that.""
Speaking in the same press conference, Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard says Gyokeres is already showing his quality in training, with the Norwegian describing his fellow Scandinavian team-mate as a ""very complete player"".
""I think you've all seen what he's done in his career so far,"" said Odegaard. ""Especially the last season at Sporting, the numbers speak for themselves.
""He's a very complete player. He's physical, strong, fast, good finisher, and intelligent as well.
""I think he's a very complete striker and you can also see the hunger, the energy he brings. I'm really excited to have him with the team.
""He's only trained a few times, but you can already see the quality, the energy, and the willingness. I'm excited to have a pitch with him.""
In the Spurs camp, new head coach Thomas Frank surprised a few by describing rivals Arsenal as ""one of the best teams in the world, unfortunately"".
The Dane, who is getting his first derby experience out in Hong Kong, said: ""I think it's a great challenge besides being our biggest rivals and the first North London Derby outside the UK.
""It's also right now one of the best teams, I must say unfortunately, in the world. We also need to be honest.
""So in that way, it's a big test but it's more than a test against Arsenal. It's not only a friendly, of course, and we'll do everything we can to win.""
Responding to those comments from the former Brentford head coach, Arteta replied: ""Well, that's great to hear that especially from someone like Frank that I respect immensely.
""And with him and Spurs, I think tomorrow we're going to start to see the direction that he's going to take with the team, implementing his vision, his philosophy.
""And of course we need to be focused on what we want to do, what we want to achieve, and I'm sure it's going to be a great game.""

Arsenal's young talent stealing the show on tour,"Arsenal have signed six players so far this summer, but it is a 15-year-old catching the eye on their tour of Asia.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0j985j9p77o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 05:08:54",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"It has been a busy summer for Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, with six new signings - including striker Viktor Gyokeres - brought in to boost their Premier League title hopes.
However, it is one of the two 15-year-old academy players on their pre-season tour of Asia who has captured the attention.
Max Dowman and Marli Salmon are the two youngest players in the squad.
And attacking midfielder Dowman has shown in friendlies against AC Milan and Newcastle exactly why there is so much excitement about his potential.
Having first trained with the first team when he was 14, Dowman was part of the senior squad that travelled to Dubai in January for their winter training camp.
There was even talk around that time about the England youth international getting a call-up to the side following an injury crisis, with key forwards Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus all sidelined at various times through injury.
Dowman replaced England international Saka in both pre-season friendlies. While he showed moments of skill in the AC Milan match, it was the performance against Newcastle that showed why he has been tipped for a Premier League debut this season.
A delightful dribble into the area, which ended with Dowman being fouled by Joelinton for a penalty that handed Arsenal a 3-2 victory, was one of the standout moments of the game.
""It is special,"" said Arteta when asked about the youngster's display against Newcastle.
""Obviously what he's done today against this team in the time that he had on the pitch is something certainly not common to witness for a 15-year-old.
""We are extremely happy to have him. I think, again, the environment that he's around in, his family, the people at the club and around the academy as well, super helpful, because they put him into this position so early in his journey - having a real chance and a real presence when he plays for the first time.""
'Keep the right mindset and let them shine'
Having joined Real Madrid at 16 after being courted by many of Europe's elite clubs, Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard says he will be ""able to share my experience"" with Dowman and England Under-16 international defender Salmon.
""I think the whole squad is really good in this way to help the young players,"" said the Norwegian, 26. ""I think myself, I just try to share my experience, guide them in the right direction, help them to keep the right mindset, because you can see that the quality is obviously there.
""Just trying to help them to have the right mindset and to help them feel good in the team and to kind of let them shine and do their thing.
""They've been amazing on this tour and you can also see the quality. It'll be exciting to see in the future.""
Dowman represented the England Under-17s in the Euros in the summer and became the competition's youngest scorer when he netted in the win over the Czech Republic.
At Arsenal he is playing three years above his age group. He scored 19 goals and provided five assists in 23 games last season, with 17 of those attacking returns coming in the last seven matches of the under-18 Premier League South season (14 goals, three assists).
Arsenal's England midfielder Declan Rice has called him an ""unreal talent"" and, given he is eligible to play in the Premier League, Dowman will be hoping to live up to the hype and follow Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri, both 18, into the first team after coming through the club's academy.

Brady queries Rooney's 'work ethic' at Birmingham,Birmingham City minority owner Tom Brady questions former Blues manager Wayne Rooney's work ethic in a new Amazon Prime documentary series.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdx0yp665e5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 21:31:09",Ciaran Varley,['Chelsea'],"NFL legend Tom Brady has questioned Wayne Rooney's attitude during the ex-England captain's tenure as manager of Birmingham City, where Brady is a minority owner.
In a new Amazon Prime documentary series, due to air on Friday, seven-time Super Bowl winner Brady tells colleagues: ""I'm a little worried about our head coach's work ethic,"" before adding: ""I mean, I don't know, I don't have great instincts on that.""
Brady, who also calls Blues players ""lazy and entitled"" in the series, made his comments about Rooney following a visit to the club's training ground in November 2023.
Filmed conversations between the former quarterback and then manager Rooney appear awkward.
In one exchange, the ex-Everton and Manchester United striker tells his employer about some of the cultural problems he perceives at the club.
""Why they're playing in the Championship and not the Premier League,"" Rooney says, ""is because... we've all passed a ball, kicked the ball and run, but it's a focus, concentrated for 90 minutes.""
In scenes that follow, Brady is filmed watching a training session, saying: ""We've got a long road ahead.""
The retired quarterback - widely considered the best player in NFL history - became a minority owner in the club in August 2023, following a takeover the previous month by Knighthead Capital Management LLC, co-founded by financier Tom Wagner.
The club were relegated to League One in the first year under their new ownership after going through seven managers in 10 months.
Two months after Brady arrived in 2023, manager John Eustace was controversially replaced by Rooney, with the Blues sitting sixth in the Championship.
However, with the club then plummeting to 20th in the table, Rooney only lasted 83 days in charge at St Andrew's.
At the time, Rooney said that he did not feel 13 weeks was ""sufficient to oversee the changes that were needed"".
During the series, Blues fan Paul Collins speculates that the appointment had been based on a desire by the ownership to hire ""one of the most recognisable English footballers of the last generation"" in order to ""put a load of eyes on Birmingham City"".
Collins asks: ""What qualifies Wayne to manage Birmingham City? Nothing.""
Brady also reflects on the owners' disastrous first season in charge.
""There was some good advice that I got that was like, 'listen, don't go in there and make these big, sweeping changes - you guys have time',"" he said.
""And of course we make sweeping changes.""
Relegated players 'lazy and entitled' - Brady
Relegation from the Championship at the end of 2023-24 meant Birmingham dropped out of English football's top two tiers for only the third time in their history.
During the series, Brady reflects on where things went wrong, blaming the players.
""Well we've already changed the coach, so it's really the players because the coach doesn't go out there and put the ball in the goal,"" he says.
""They were lazy, they were entitled and when you're lazy and entitled, you don't have much of a chance to succeed.
""We've got to change all the people that are associated with losing, so I think this summer there's going to be a lot of people gone.""
That summer, the club invested £30m in transfers, an unprecedented figure for League One.
The following year, Birmingham broke the Football League record for most points in a season, finishing top of League One with a tally of 111.
Brady struggles to find the Blues' training ground
During one scene, on his way to visit Birmingham's training ground, Brady's manager Ben Rawitz jokes about the NFL legend struggling to locate the club's Elite Performance and Innovation Centre on a map.
""That's the owner right there, he doesn't know where his training facility is,"" Rawitz says, later comparing the facilities to a ""high school"".
In another scene, during a separate visit to the city, Brady asks a colleague ""What's the other team here?"", following up by asking ""is Aston Villa in the Premier League?"".
Ambition 'bigger' than Wrexham's - Wagner
There are comparisons throughout the series to fellow Championship club Wrexham, who have enjoyed three consecutive promotions since the Welsh club's £2m takeover in February 2021 by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.
Wagner dismisses the idea that the two clubs should be considered in the same bracket.
""They've done a spectacular job at bringing attention to a small club,"" he says.
""I think what we have here is a club that's already a very big club and so, from our perspective, it's a bit different. The ambitions for us in the context of what we'll build is bigger than what they'll do at Wrexham.""

Man Utd's number one target - is this finally the summer of Sesko?,He's Manchester United's number one target - but can they finally make this the summer of Benjamin Sesko?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr74n5v114jo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 19:56:48",Emlyn Begley,['Manchester United'],"""He's good in front of goal. He has a good attitude. He is relentless.""
You can see why Premier League teams are interested in £70m-rated Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.
Despite only being 22, it feels as if the Slovenia international has been linked to English football for years - so could this be the summer he makes the move?
Manchester United have made him their top striker target, while Newcastle United also want him - if Alexander Isak leaves.
He had been strongly linked to Arsenal for some time before they went for Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres. Plus Chelsea, too (though who isn't...?).
Big, strong, quick, good in the air and a fine finisher, Sesko has been compared to Erling Haaland - and not just because they both played for Salzburg.
So why are so many clubs being linked with him?
'The quality to play in one of Europe's best sides'
Sesko is a goalscorer. In fact, nobody in his age range has scored more goals in the past two seasons (more on that later).
But last season he became more of an all-rounder, with 9.7% of his touches coming in the opposition box - compared with 17% the season before.
He got involved more on both wings and further back into midfield.
He was one of the fastest strikers in the Bundesliga at 35.7km/h - and had the best aerial success rate of strikers involved in at least 60 of them.
A recruitment specialist working at the highest level recently spoke to BBC Sport reporter Alex Howell about Sesko, who stands at 6ft 5in tall.
""He's so athletic, he's big, physical and strong,"" said the anonymous source.
""I think the physicality of the Premier League won't overawe him.
""When you look at some players in Europe, where the tempo is slower, you see them struggle to transition to bigger leagues.
""The Bundesliga is one of the big three in the world, but when you look at transitioning in big leagues he has the physical capabilities to do it.""
And what are some other qualities of Sesko, who idolised former Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic when he was younger?
""He is clinical, he can drop in into space,"" said the recruitment expert.
""One of his strengths is getting the ball quickly. He can hold it, hold defenders off, he can give it to the winger, he can give it to the 10.
""He's good in front of goal. He has a good attitude. He is relentless.""
""You wouldn't expect him to hit the ground running straight away, but in six to 12 months he will be fine and you've got yourself a very good player.""
Central European football expert Lukas Vrablik added: ""I think Sesko has the quality to play in one of Europe's best sides. He can be a big asset. At the same time he's a player who will develop.
""He's not the finished product yet. Right now he is one of the best strikers in Europe, but he still has room for improvement.""
So how prolific is he?
Sesko has spent the past two seasons in Germany with Leipzig, having joined them from sister club Salzburg in 2023.
That was a deal that had been agreed and announced in the summer of 2022 - making him unavailable for any English sides.
He has scored 39 goals in 87 games in all competitions in those two seasons (plus eight assists), with 27 in 64 in the league.
Six of those goals have come in the Champions League.
Since moving to Germany, Sesko is the top goalscorer currently aged under 23 in all competitions, of players who are based in Europe's top five leagues.
He is one above Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham and five clear of Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for £100m this summer.
""Last season, I don't think he was as good as the season before - but that was also influenced by Leipzig not being so good as a team,"" added Vrablik.
""There are big expectations for him as a striker. There is big hype around him.""
Sesko has shown clinical finishing in his time in Germany, too.
Only six forwards have scored more goals in the Bundesliga in the past two seasons, even though Sesko is 16th for expected goals, 14th on shots and 22nd on touches in the opposition box.
And he is lethal from long range too, with 36.8% of his shots - and 23.1% of his goals - coming from outside the box. Both are higher than any Bundesliga striker to score 12 or more goals last season.
Where it all started for 'confident' Sesko
All of Sesko's senior football so far has come for Red Bull teams in Europe, having left home aged 16 for Salzburg.
He played two seasons for Salzburg's feeder club - Liefering - in Austria's second tier, scoring 22 goals in 44 matches.
Some 21 goals of those came in 2020-21, having only netted once the season before.
And from there he played for Salzburg, bagging 29 goals in 79 games in two full seasons. He won the league both seasons, plus the Austrian Cup, scoring in the final win over Ried.
Slovenian journalist Miran Zore said in 2024: ""We kind of expected his success but no-one knew he was so special, except his agent, Elvis Basanovic, who tried to convince people about his potential.
""He used to send messages to scouts and directors, saying, 'this is the next goal machine'.
""When he was struggling in Salzburg at the start, people were asking his agent, 'where's this goal machine'. Now, everyone is laughing about it.""
In 2022, Sesko himself was quoted as saying: ""My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him.""
Manchester City striker Haaland (who left Salzburg before Sesko's debut) netted the same amount of goals for the Austrian club as Sesko - but the Norwegian only needed 27 matches, 34% of the amount Sesko played.
So maybe his team-mates were just being nice...
Even so, that comment alone would suggest some degree of self-assurance.
""I hear from people in Slovenia who worked with him that he's a really hard-working guy - and really confident,"" said Vrablik.
""He has a healthy confidence, which is really important for a striker.""
For his country, Sesko has scored 16 goals in 41 games and featured for them at Euro 2024. Only three players have ever scored more for the former Yugoslav nation.
Speaking in 2024, former Slovenia international Miran Pavlin said: ""He has to focus on playing well and the transfer will come - if not this year, then in one or two years.
""He has the potential to be one of the top 10 strikers in the world, for sure.""
Man Utd lead the chase - but where will he actually go?
There is no certainty that Sesko will leave Leipzig.
However, they have failed to qualify for Europe this season and have started a summer rebuild under new boss Ole Werner.
BBC Sport was told Sesko has an informal agreement with his club that he can leave if an elite team offer about £70m.
When Sesko joined Leipzig from sister club Salzburg in 2023 he had a release clause of £55m - but last summer he signed a new long-term deal.
Reports suggest that also has a release clause, which has climbed.
That begs the question of who could afford him? The answer is: not many teams bar Premier League sides or Saudi clubs.
""He's well positioned to make a difference at a top club. It's just a matter of time until he moves,"" said Vrablik. ""But maybe not this summer.
""I think the price paid a part [on why he hasn't moved yet]. There are not many clubs who can afford him right now, which is a problem if he wants to move on.
""I wouldn't be surprised to see him stay at Leipzig another season. It might be good for his development if he can repeat the season from before Euro 2024.
""It depends on the market, maybe some departure would bring this effect. I expected him to end up at Arsenal.""
Arsenal were interested in Sesko before signing Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, in a deal worth up to £64m (73m euros ) - so still big money, but slightly cheaper.
Manchester United had put Sesko and Aston Villa's England striker Ollie Watkins at the top of their list, but are now focusing on the Slovenian and have spoken to Leipzig.
United have already spent £130m on forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer, but still have money to spend.
Rasmus Hojlund is United's other striker.
But Newcastle also want Sesko - if their own star striker leaves.
Swede Isak was not part of their pre-season tour to Asia and BBC Sport was told he is looking at his options.
Liverpool are said to be interested in Isak but a move would certainly cost in excess of £100m.
That fee would, in turn, leave Newcastle able to afford Sesko.
Callum Wilson left St James' Park on a free transfer this summer, meaning 21-year-old William Osula would be their only senior striker if Isak did leave.
Unlike Manchester United, a move to the Magpies would enable Sesko to play in the Champions League next season.
As would Chelsea - who have also been linked.
However, the Blues have already signed strikers Liam Delap and Joao Pedro for a combined £90m this summer, so would need to offload Nicolas Jackson and perhaps others.
Half of Europe's elite teams - including Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and AC Milan - have also been reportedly keen in the past too.
But those links have gone cold.
Will it be the same for those Premier League clubs currently in the mix for his signature - or is this finally the summer Sesko makes his move?

The 19-year-old Dutchman is expected to sign a seven-year contract lasting until 2032 and will complete a medical, having been given the green light to travel to west London.
Chelsea consider Hato a talented young option to add competition to the backline, where he is capable of playing at either left-back or in central defence.
Hato made his senior debut for Ajax in February 2023 at just 16 years and 335 days old, making him the third-youngest player ever to feature in an Eredivisie game for the club
He has made 75 appearances for the Eredivisie side and made his senior debut for the Netherlands in 2023.
Ajax have decided to sell him, with a need to raise funds after a two-year hiatus from the substantial revenues of the Champions League. They will return to Europe's top-tier competition this season.
Chelsea are believed to be close to finishing their summer business but remain in the market for another attacker, having held talks with the representatives of RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons without making a formal bid.
They are also aiming to make further player sales with Christopher Nkunku likely to leave, as well as an openness to sell striker Nicolas Jackson for the right price.
There also remains a squad of unwanted players training separately from Enzo Maresca's first team, including Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Renato Veiga, Axel Disasi, Carney Chukwuemeka, Armando Broja and Lesley Ugochukwu.
Who have Chelsea signed this summer?
Hato would be Chelsea's eighth addition to the squad this summer, with their spending so far reaching a combined sum of over £250m, which is balanced by over £150m of player sales.
Jamie Gittens - £48m from Borussia Dortmund. The England youth international arrives from the Bundesliga with a growing reputation as a direct, pacey winger capable of unlocking defences.
Joao Pedro - £55m from Brighton. Chelsea moved swiftly to secure the Brazilian forward, who impressed in the Premier League with his creativity, link-up play and finishing ability.
Liam Delap - £30m from Ipswich Town. A powerful striker with Premier League experience, Delap adds a different profile to Chelsea's attacking options.
Mamadou Sarr - £12m from Lyon. The 19-year-old centre-back joins as one for the future, bringing strength and composure in defence after progressing through Lyon's academy.
Dario Essugo - £18m from Sporting CP. A highly rated Portuguese midfielder, Essugo is known for his tenacity and maturity, having debuted in Liga Portugal at just 16 years old.
Estevao Willian - the Brazil winger joined the Blues from Palmeiras this summer in a £29m deal that was agreed in May 2024.
Kendry Paez - a £17m deal to sign Ecuadorian teenager Paez was agreed in 2023 but he has linked up with Chelsea this summer after turning 18 in May.

'No intention' to be compared with Henry - Gyokeres,"New Arsenal signing Viktor Gyokeres says he just wants ""to do my own thing"" after taking the number 14 shirt previously worn by the club's all-time leading goalscorer Thierry Henry.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn84gv4n18ko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:05:49",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"New Arsenal signing Viktor Gyokeres says he just wants ""to do my own thing"" after taking the number 14 shirt previously worn by the club's all-time leading goalscorer Thierry Henry.
The 27-year-old completed his transfer - worth up to £64m (73m euros) - on Saturday, ending the Gunners' hunt for a striker to help their quest to lift a trophy for the first time since the FA Cup in 2020 in Mikel Arteta's first season.
Henry's 228 goals in 377 games made him synonymous with Arsenal's number 14 shirt.
And speaking before what could be his first match in Arsenal colours in Hong Kong against rivals Tottenham on Thursday, Gyokeres says it was an ""easy"" choice to make when selecting his squad number.
""Of course I know about the history,"" said Gyokeres.
""To be honest there weren't so many numbers available. There weren't too many to pick from.
""But of course, that one was available. So when I knew that it was an easy choice to take it.""
Henry won two Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the Premier League Golden Boot four times with Arsenal, but Gyokeres is not worried about any comparisons that may come between the two.
""I don't know. It's not really my intention to be compared with what he's achieved in his career,"" he said.
""Especially here. I just want to do my own thing and show my qualities. Of course he was an amazing player, but different from me. I just want to try to do my own thing.""
Arteta said he felt the number would be a good fit for Gyokeres after their initial meeting.
""I use the word conviction and that's the first thing that I noticed when I spoke to him,"" he explained.
""Someone very determined, someone that was already really attached to the club the way he was talking about the club, the history and in this case Thierry and what the shirt represented. He straight away felt it, and when you feel it - go for it.""
There has been a huge fan reaction to Gyokeres' signing with purchases of his replica shirt breaking club records.
""Of course it's great to see. It's very nice. Of course that gives you extra motivation,"" he added.
""I think I have enough expectations on myself. I'll just try to perform anyway.""
'Joining Arsenal wasn't a difficult choice'
The signing of Gyokeres was one of the longest running transfers of the summer and it was held up in the final week while Arsenal and Sporting negotiated over the add-ons to the transfer fee.
Sporting's club president Frederico Varandas also said that Gyokeres faced disciplinary action after failing to report for training, while every stage of the deal created a lot of fan interest.
""It's been a new experience. I haven't really been in that situation before,"" Gyokeres said.
""It's been a lot of waiting from my side. I wanted to come here, but it wasn't that easy. But I'm finally here and it feels great.
""I tried to train as much as possible by myself and keep the day going. A lot of days were the same kind of routine.
""I woke up, trained, had dinner and then went to bed again. It was like that for a few weeks, but it was worth it for sure.""
His new manager Arteta has spoken about the excitement that he and the players have about the signing of the Sweden international and Gyokeres says he felt ""that they wanted me here"".
He added: ""Also because it's a very big club with a lot of history. I just felt that I really wanted to come here and be a part of this club.
""I think you can always have a decision of your future. Of course there were other clubs as well, but I didn't feel it was a difficult choice for me this time.""
Gyokeres scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting and registered 26 assists and although the striker backs himself to succeed in the Premier League, he thinks there will be a period of transititon.
""I think I'll have to adapt. But I think there are a lot of players from Portugal who have done even better in England. It depends on who you pick,"" he said.
""I think it's difficult to compare one player to another. And how they're performing in a different league.
""Because there are a lot of different factors. Not only a better league. If you play in a better team also, it makes it easier. Especially if you're an attacking player. So we'll have to see.""
Gyokeres has only been with his team-mates for a few days but has said that Arteta has already made clear what he wants from him.
""Just try to use my qualities as much as I can,"" he said.
""But as you said, I haven't been here too long. I've only done one training session.
""I think I have to do a few more to come into it even more. So far it's been feeling great. I'm looking forward to doing even more.""

'Duty fulfilled' - Diaz leaves Liverpool for Bayern,German champions Bayern Munich complete the £65.5m signing of Liverpool and Colombia winger Luis Diaz.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1w8j9g5qleo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:57:02",Sean Kearns,['Liverpool'],"Luis Diaz says he ""fulfilled his duty"" at Liverpool after completing a £65.5m move to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.
The Colombia international has signed a four-year deal with the German club to bring his three-and-a-half-year stay at Anfield to an end.
The 28-year-old was left out of Liverpool's pre-season match against AC Milan on Saturday because of speculation over his future.
Having rejected Bayern's opening offer of £58.6m earlier this month, Liverpool accepted a follow-up bid of £65.5m over the weekend and gave Diaz permission to have a medical with the club.
The winger leaves the Reds as a Premier League champion, having won four pieces of major silverware during his time at the club, and says his exit would have been the ""perfect goodbye"" if not for the death of team-mate Diogo Jota earlier this month.
""I arrived with all the dreams in the world, and I am leaving proud of everything we achieved together,"" Diaz wrote on Instagram.
""I have met incredible people, fabulous colleagues, coaches who helped me a lot, and extraordinary fans. Liverpool is, indeed, a special team, and I will keep everyone in my heart.
""It's good to be leaving with the feeling of a duty fulfilled, and, most of all, to be leaving a champion. It would have been the perfect goodbye if we hadn't lost one of ours in such a tragic way.
""I carry everyone with me in my heart, but one of them in particular: Diogo. I will never forget him. We will never forget him. Thank you for everything.""
Diaz joined Liverpool from Porto for an initial £37m in January 2022, scoring 41 goals in 148 appearances during his time at Anfield.
He won the FA Cup and EFL Cup during his opening season with the Reds, and was part of the side that lost to Real Madrid in the 2022 Champions League final.
Diaz enjoyed the most prolific season of his career last term, scoring 17 goals in all competitions as Liverpool won the Premier League.
The winger's exit means Liverpool have made around £115m in player sales so far this summer.
That has helped to offset spending of around £270m on Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.
The Reds remain interested in Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, who did not travel on the Magpies' far-east tour and is exploring options to leave the club.
How big a loss is Diaz?
Since his debut in January 2022, Diaz has combined consistent dribbling ability with steadily increasing goal threat. During his time at the club he led the Reds in terms of dribbles completed and fouls won, while ranking second for goals, goal involvements and touches in the opposition box.
It is no accident that his shot conversion rate last term - 19% in all competitions - was comfortably his highest in a Liverpool shirt. The winger made 39% of his league appearances as a false nine, meaning he was able to shoot from central areas more often. Head coach Arne Slot trialled Diaz in that role against Bayer Leverkusen in November, when the Colombian scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 win, and it was a ploy the Merseysiders used to good effect in December and January.
In addition to his threat going forward, Diaz is renowned for grafting for the team. He won possession in the final third 70 times in the Premier League, the second most by a Liverpool player since his arrival, and ranks similarly highly for duels won despite his relatively slight 5ft 10in (1.78m) frame.
When used centrally last term, his high-energy pressing helped set the tempo for the Reds. But next season that role could be filled by club record signing Florian Wirtz, who - for all his attacking flair - works like a demon off the ball. The 22-year-old German won possession in the final third 71 times in the past two Bundesliga seasons, 15 more than any other player.
In terms of filling the void Diaz leaves on the left flank, Cody Gakpo appears the obvious beneficiary. The Dutchman scored 18 times last season, though he isn't quite as effective at dribbling through congested spaces.
Rio Ngumoha, who turns 17 in August, started this month's friendlies against Preston, Stoke and AC Milan and could eventually benefit from Diaz's departure, though the youngster has only made one competitive appearance to date.
Another new signing, Hugo Ekitike, might also be deployed on the left on occasions. The Frenchman is more likely to play up front but could also slot in elsewhere as part of a fluid forward line - something that may be necessary if Liverpool manage to prise Alexander Isak away from Newcastle.

Shaw backs Amorim approach to 'toxic' and 'unhealthy' Man Utd culture,"Manchester United defender Luke Shaw backs head coach Ruben Amorim's hard-line approach to improving the ""toxic"" and ""unhealthy"" culture at the club.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0j98qpwwx0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:00:58",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has backed head coach Ruben Amorim's hard-line approach to improving the ""toxic"" and ""unhealthy"" culture at the club.
In May, after United's Europa League final defeat by Tottenham, Shaw questioned whether he and his team-mates were good enough to play for the club, comments that drew criticism, external from former captain Gary Neville.
Looking back, Shaw said his damning assessment was triggered by a mixture of the hurt he was feeling at a time when his head was still ""hot"" as he tried to come to terms with the shattering defeat, which cost United any chance of European qualification after their woeful 15th-placed Premier League finish.
Amorim responded to the loss by resolving to drive up standards inside the dressing room while also excluding five senior players, including Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.
""It's not hard to see from the outside what it's been like,"" said Shaw.
""A lot of the time I've been here over the last few years it's been extremely negative.
""It can be quite toxic, the environment, it's not healthy at all. We need an environment that's healthy, that's positive, that's got good energy and happiness. When you have all those things, you feel free and you express yourself more.
""Ruben brings demands. Mentality is a big thing. He talks a lot about it.
""He demands 100% and doesn't want anything less. If someone's doing 85-90%, it's not enough. I think, especially this year, if you're not doing the right things, you won't play.""
Shaw, 30, said the message must be reinforced by United's senior players, including himself.
""The more experienced ones need to be demanding more, day in, day out,"" he added.
""The levels in training, keeping to the times of when we're doing this or that, making sure no-one's coming late.
""The manager's not bothered. He doesn't care who the player is. That's how it should be. Whatever he wants, as players, we have to be delivering – and we are fully behind that.""
Shaw did not mention United's 'bomb squad' - Rashford, Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Antony - in his assessment and was not placing all the blame on those players, four of whom were not even at United for the second half of last season.
In a separate chat at a Premier League event in Chicago, the England defender did say there are ""no stragglers in this group any more"" and Amorim had made it clear ""everyone needs to put the team first"".
However, United's longest serving player feels the aftermath of the final defeat in Bilbao took the club to such a bad place, it left everyone in Amorim's squad uncertain for what the future held.
""I wouldn't say I regret what I said but straight after the game, your head is hot, you say things and don't think about it,"" he said.
""A lot of people, after that final, and after that year, didn't know how the next season was going to look, we have to be open and honest about that. None of us were good enough.
""I had such an awful year as well. I was just fully angry about everything. That's why I did the interview and said what I said.""
'I felt like I let a lot of people down'
Amorim described Shaw as ""world class"" in Chicago last week.
The assessment was passed on to the 30-year-old almost immediately in the belief it would give his confidence a boost.
Shaw said he is currently in a good place, but there have been plenty of times over the past two years when that has not been the case.
After missing three months with a muscular injury at the start of the 2023-24 campaign, he suffered another problem in a game at Luton in February 2024.
Shaw recovered enough to start for England in that summer's Euros final but did not start a game for United until 27 April, 2025 - a gap of 14 months. During that time, Erik ten Hag was sacked and Amorim struggled to fill the left-sided defensive berth crucial to his system.
""I don't want to keep banging on about it but I couldn't have got any lower last season,"" said Shaw.
""I know I've had a lot of injuries but, mentally, last season was really tough.
""I've never had a calf injury in my life, it was completely different rehab. Then stuff just kept happening. It was really stressful.
""I felt like I let Erik down because I wasn't there for him towards the end and that wasn't nice.
""For a lot of last season I felt like I let a lot of people in the club down. I found it really hard and put a lot of blame on myself.""
There is no doubt a fully fit Shaw would be a huge asset.
Amorim has tended to use him in the left of his three-man defence, where there is competition from 18-year-old Ayden Heaven, plus senior players Noussair Mazraoui and Lisandro Martinez, who are both currently injured.
Shaw could also play at left wing-back, although whether Amorim would risk him in such a physically demanding role is open to debate.
""I really like this formation,"" he admitted. ""I haven't spoken about it too much with the manager, but I'm happy to play anywhere.
""I've been playing left centre-back this pre-season so we'll have to see if that carries on. I missed last pre-season so I'm just really happy to be doing this one.""

Spurs teenager Moore set to join Rangers on loan,Rangers are close to completing a loan deal to sign 17-year-old Tottenham Hotspur forward Mikey Moore.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3r4x77yrlzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 09:04:43",Nizaar Kinsella,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Rangers are close to completing a loan deal to sign Tottenham Hotspur forward Mikey Moore.
The 17-year-old is regarded as one of English football's brightest young talents and has decided a move to the Scottish Premiership club will further his development.
The move is subject to a medical and will include an extension to Moore's contract in north London that would allow him to spend the season at Ibrox.
Spurs have explained that Moore is among several players left behind from their pre-season tour in Asia, along with the likes of Alfie Devine and Dane Scarlett, to pursue a loan move while the senior side prepare to face Arsenal in Hong Kong on Thursday.
When asked about Moore's future, Spurs manager Thomas Frank said on Tuesday: ""It is very important [he goes on loan]. Mikey is a big talent. I'm really excited about his future here at Tottenham.
""I think, for all players, but especially younger players, they need consistent first-team football into their bodies. I think, if we can find the right option, we will do that.""
Moore is the youngest player to have played for Tottenham in the Premier League, having made his debut at the age of 16 years and 277 days in May 2024.
The England Under-19 international also became the youngest player to start a Premier League match for the club in October.
Moore also broke Spurs legend Jimmy Greaves' record of becoming the youngest English scorer in a major European competition during the club's Europa League-winning campaign last season.
Rangers are preparing for the season under the new management of former Southampton head coach Russell Martin and the new 49ers Enterprises majority ownership, having finished second last season behind rivals Celtic.
They face Panathinaikos in the second leg of their Champions League second qualifying round tie on Wednesday before a trip to Motherwell's Fir Park on Saturday to start their domestic campaign.

Football transfer rumours: Aston Villa want Porto’s Samu Aghehowa for £55m?,Today’s fluff is flexible,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/football-transfer-rumours-aston-villa-want-porto-samu-aghehowa-for-55m,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 07:35:03",Will Unwin,['Chelsea'],"There is some swirling uncertainty surrounding the future of Ollie Watkins, so Aston Villa are taking precautions. They have got on to the blower to Porto to ask how much Samu Aghehowa would cost. André Villas-Boas, who is now the club president, wants £55m for him, which is a big chunk of change but the 20-year-old did score 19 in 30 appearances last season and is a fully-fledged Spain international.
Speaking of Spanish strikers potentially on the move, Sunderland are in talks with Chelsea to sign one of their many reserves. The Black Cats want Marc Guiu, who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Barcelona just over a year ago. His first season in England resulted in only three Premier League appearances and it comes as no surprise, after the signing of Liam Delap, that he might need to move elsewhere to get more time on the pitch. At the other end of the pitch, Sunderland are closing on Robin Roefs, who will cost an initial £9m from NEC. One player not leaving the Stadium of Light this week is Nectarios Triantis after a £1.2m bid from Derby was rejected for the midfielder.
It turns out that MLS is not all about signing hasbeens on free transfers anymore. Atlanta United made a £30m bid for the Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta but the Eagles rejected it out of hand. The Londoners are not interested in selling their main man, forcing the Americans to turn their attentions to Rodrigo Muniz.
After a mixed bag of a season at Nottingham Forest, Àlex Moreno is not wanted back at Aston Villa. They seem very happy to return him to La Liga, with Girona considering whether to the sign the left-back on a permanent or loan deal.
Tyler Morton is likely to leave Liverpool in the coming weeks and an interesting proposal has come his way, courtesy of Ligue 1 side Lyon. The French club could face a little bit of competition from West Ham. Another Anfield fringe man, Federico Chiesa was offered an exit route by José Mourinho but the Italian did not think a sojourn in the Turkish Super Lig was right for him, preferring a return to Serie A.
Down in the Championship, Wrexham’s entertaining recruitment could continue with the signing of England centre-back Conor Coady from Leicester. It is difficult to forget Mamady Sidibé, the former Stoke striker who very rarely scored. His legacy lives in on at Stoke, in the form of his more talented 18-year-old son Sol Sidibé. The midfielder is set to swap the Potteries for Eindhoven to join PSV on a four-year deal after the Championship club agreed a £2m deal with the Dutch side.
Luton’s Lamine Fanne is wanted around Europe. Turkish side Konyaspor have already made contact with the Hatters about the Senegalese midfielder, who only moved to Kenilworth Road in January. Istanbul Basaksehir, Empoli and Copenhagen are also interested in the 21-year-old.

Chelsea agree £35.5m deal for Ajax’s Jorrel Hato and want RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons,"Hato, 19, set to sign seven-year deal at Stamford Bridge",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/29/chelsea-35m-deal-for-ajax-jorrel-hato-rb-leipzig-xavi-simons-transfer,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 20:43:46",Ed Aarons,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have agreed to pay an initial €40m (£35.5m) for Jorrel Hato, with the teenage Ajax defender set to sign a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge having already agreed personal terms.
The Netherlands defender is due to fly to London for his medical in the coming days after Chelsea finalised the terms of the deal, which it is understood includes significant add-ons. The 19-year-old has made more than 100 appearances for Ajax’s first team and is capable of playing as a left-back or in central defence. He fits Chelsea’s policy of signing promising young players on long-term deals.
Hato was not included in Ajax’s squad for pre-season competition the Como Cup on Sunday in anticipation of his impending move to Chelsea. In 2023 he became the youngest player to captain Ajax aged 17 and made his senior international debut a few weeks later. He is regarded as one of Europe’s brightest prospects and was part of the Netherlands Under-21 side that lost to England in the semi-finals of the European Championship in Slovakia last month.
He will become Chelsea’s seventh signing of the summer after the arrivals of Liam Delap, João Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Estêvão, Dário Essugo and Mamadou Sarr. They are also in talks with RB Leipzig over a move for Xavi Simons, with the Netherlands forward thought to be valued at around €70m.
The 22-year-old, who is capable of playing in several attacking roles, joined Leipzig from Paris Saint-Germain in January for €50m after two successful loan spells.
Simons has also attracted interest from Bayern Munich but is thought to prefer a move to the Premier League.
Chelsea have already sanctioned the departures of Kepa Arrizabalaga, Noni Madueke and Djordje Petrovic, while João Félix joined the Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr on Tuesday after a £44m deal was agreed.

Manchester United keen on Ollie Watkins but baulk at Aston Villa’s £60m valuation,Villa won’t listen to lower offers for England striker,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/30/manchester-united-ollie-watkins-aston-villa-60m-valuation-transfer-bid,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:39:58",Will Unwin,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","Manchester United are interested in signing Ollie Watkins but are unwilling to meet Aston Villa’s valuation of the striker. Arsenal made numerous bids for the England international in January but were knocked back as Villa held out for £60m, a fee they would demand for any sale this summer.
Ruben Amorim has been seeking a new striker given the struggles of both Rasmus Højlund and Joshua Zirzkee last season. Another option is RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson is no longer part of the thinking at Old Trafford.
Aston Villa insist Watkins is not for sale and are in a position of strength as his contract runs until 2028, meaning it would take an extremely high offer for them to consider parting ways. It would also be difficult for the club to find a replacement with the new season a little more than a fortnight away. United value Watkins at between £40m and £45m, which is similar to what Arsenal were offering in January.
Sesko is seven years Watkins’ junior, arguably making him a better long-term prospect. But Leipzig are thought to want almost £80m for the Slovenian, who scored 13 goals in the Bundesliga last season. Sesko is thought to also be a target for Newcastle as they face uncertainty over Alexander Isak’s future.
United have already spent in excess of £130m on signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer and focus will turn to offloading some of their unwanted players. Marcus Rashford’s wages have been taken off the books after he joined Barcelona on loan but Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia remain. If United want to acquire a new striker, bringing in fees from the sales of these four will be imperative.
The club, meanwhile, have made a key appointment, hiring Mike Sansoni as head of data, replacing Dominic Jordan who left last year. Sansoni arrives from Mercedes Formula One team, of which Sir Jim Ratcliffe owns a third, where spent 11 years, mostly working as a senior performance engineer. He will be responsible for “transforming the club’s capabilities in data and artificial intelligence”. Furthermore, Kirstin Furber will arrive as director of people in the autumn from Channel 4.

‘A new area’: why British clubs are increasingly turning to Asia to sign players,"Spurs and Newcastle are two of the clubs who have made signings from the world’s fastest growing talent pools, with greater recognition of the technical ability they bring",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/30/a-new-area-why-british-clubs-are-increasingly-turning-to-asia-to-sign-players,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:00:00",John Duerden,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Arsène Wenger was ahead of the curve in 2013 when he identified one of the world’s fastest growing talent pools. “I find a new market that is very interesting and very competitive is the Japanese market,” he said. “Look at the number of Japanese players who play now in Germany for example.”
And now England. This summer, Japan’s Kota Takai became part of the new Thomas Frank era at Tottenham while Birmingham have added another two Japanese players to take their contingent to three. They also have the South Korean midfielder Paik Seung-ho while his compatriot Park Seung-soo has joined Newcastle from Suwon Bluewings.
“The idea is that we’re coming into a new area,” the Newcastle scout Oliver Slater says. “We’re coming into a new market, which we have not really looked too much into before.”
Post-Brexit rules have made it easier for clubs to sign players directly from Japan and Korea but there is also a greater recognition of the talent available in East Asia. Japan were not just the first team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, but are no longer satisfied with just reaching a tournament with the captain and Liverpool midfielder Wataru Endo telling fans that it is time to talk of winning. The Japan FA long ago set a target of 2050, but now that seems a little unambitious. The talk is of a last-eight place next year, the semis by 2030 and then to go and win. Given talent such as Kaoru Mitoma of Brighton and the fact that Japan’s youth development system is one of the best in the world, it would not be a shock.
There are five Japanese players in the Premier League now that Takehiro Tomiyasu has left Arsenal after injury issues. There are nine in the Championship and – apart from the British nations and Ireland – only Jamaica, Denmark and Australia have more representatives in the second tier.
“The Premier League has changed English football and that in turn has changed the Championship,” says Eddy Bosnar, who played in Japan and South Korea before heading home to Australia where he later became head of recruitment at Western Sydney Wanderers.
“There is a lot more technical football now and it suits Japanese players more as they are excellent in that respect and also quick and always ready to listen and learn. In Australia, we were ahead of them back in the day, our team was full of players at big European clubs from 2000 to 2005 but now Japan are way ahead because of their development.”
Not only are they good, they are also relatively cheap and heading overseas at a younger age. The Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said last week in Australia that clubs have to look elsewhere as the European market is expensive. As yet, Japan’s is not. Takai, a classy defender called “Japan’s Van Dijk” by the national team coach, Hajime Moriyasu, was the most expensive Japanese player in J.League history but the international joined Spurs for less than £6m. Even if the 20-year-old never plays for Tottenham, the club would probably get their money back.
“In Japan, they want to give the players a chance to go to Europe as it is good for Japanese football in the long-term,” Bosnar, who was also at Dinamo Zagreb, says. “They also, like clubs in Croatia, wait for the second transfer – players come and then get sold and then there is a sell-on clause.”
There is a debate in Japan whether clubs are undervaluing their talent and, as more players impress, the fees are sure to rise. For now, though, there is a desire to be seen to be helping youngsters move on and, for obvious reasons, J.League clubs would rather their best players join Tottenham or Celtic rather than a domestic rival.
Korean clubs have historically received better fees for their young talents and while league leaders Jeonbuk Motors have, for now, denied their star Jeon Jin-woo a move to the Championship when they are in the middle of a title race, there is also a desire for their players to head to England.
Park Ji-sung was the pioneer for many, joining Manchester United in 2005 and ensuring that his countrymen and women back home were served a weekly Premier League diet. Park made an international name for himself helping the Taeguk Warriors reach the last four at the 2002 World Cup, moving to PSV Eindhoven soon after and, after a slow start, becoming a star and heading to Old Trafford.
“The World Cup helped both countries and the football has grown a lot since then,” Bosnar says. “As soon as a World Cup comes to a country, then everything changes, and it continues to change.”
More than two decades on, Korean and Japanese players have shown their worth on the pitch. There are still comments about shirts being sold in the “Far East” when new signings are made, but these are much less common than in the past. Japan, especially, are becoming a force in the world of football, and increasingly in England.

Crystal Palace want chunk of £67.5m Eze fee up front as Arsenal talks continue,Palace ask for £35m in advance if deal goes through,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/30/crystal-palace-67m-eberechi-eze-fee-up-front-arsenal-talks-continue,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:35:19",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have been informed that they would have to pay more than half of Eberechi Eze’s release clause up front to sign the England forward, with Crystal Palace determined not to allow him to leave for less than a fee that could reach up to £67.5m including bonuses.
It is understood Arsenal officials have held initial talks with Palace over a deal for Eze, who has two years left on his contract at Selhurst Park. Palace are believed to have indicated that they are not willing to accept any bids below the 27-year-old’s release clause and want £35m in advance, with the rest of his initial £60m fee due in instalments.
The clause includes up to £7.5m in add-ons and is thought to expire before the Premier League season kicks off on 16 August, although that is not understood to affect Palace’s valuation of the player they signed from Queens Park Rangers in 2020 for a fee worth up to £19.5m. QPR are believed to be due 15% of any profit Palace make on the sale. Arsenal officials are understood to have met with Eze’s representatives last month to discuss personal terms and he is thought to be keen to return to the club where he was released as a 13-year-old.
Having committed more than £200m on six players during this window, Arsenal are hoping to move on several fringe players that could help fund a move for Eze. There is interest in Leandro Trossard from other Premier League clubs as well as Borussia Dortmund, with the Belgium forward yet to sign an extension on his deal that expires next summer, although Arsenal have an option to extend it by 12 months. Reiss Nelson is being targeted by Fulham, while Albert Sambi Lokonga, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Fábio Vieira would also be allowed to depart for the right price.
With the appeal against their demotion from the Europa League due to be heard at the court of arbitration for sport on or before 11 August, Palace are also facing uncertainty over the future of captain Marc Guéhi. He is wanted by Liverpool but the Premier League champions have so far been reluctant to meet Palace’s valuation for the defender, whose contract expires next summer.
Palace are believed to have lined up Ousmane Diomande from Sporting as a potential replacement for Guéhi, while they are also interested in Bilal El Khannouss of Leicester. But with goalkeeper Walter Benítez and defender Borna Sosa the only new additions to the squad so far, manager Oliver Glasner has admitted his disappointment at Palace’s lack of activity. “Even though all the players are still here, we haven’t made the most of the transfer window so far,” the manager told Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung during the club’s pre-season tour. “I was promised that we would be more active and bring in the new players earlier this year.
“As of now, I have 17 outfield players. I hope we don’t lose any more. If that happens and we get four new ones on deadline day like last year, another false start is possible”. Glasner has yet to reopen talks about extending his contract, which expires at the end of next season.
Palace failed to win any of their opening eight Premier League fixtures last season but went on to finish 12th and picked up their first major trophy thanks to Eze’s winner against Manchester City in the FA Cup final. They return to Wembley to face Liverpool in the Community Shield on 10 August.

Luis Díaz completes £65.5m move from Liverpool to Bayern Munich,Colombian signs four-year deal with German champions,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/30/luis-diaz-completes-655m-move-from-liverpool-to-bayern-munich,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:17:47",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool’s financial position has been strengthened before a potential bid for Alexander Isak after Luis Díaz completed his €75m (£65.5m) move to Bayern Munich.
Díaz has signed a four-year contract with the option of an extra year with the Bundesliga champions after Liverpool received an improved offer they felt represented fair market value for the 28-year-old Colombia international on Sunday. Díaz, who left Liverpool’s pre-season training camp in Tokyo on Monday to seal the transfer, turns 29 in January and had made it clear he wished to leave the Premier League champions.
The winger had wanted to leave last summer but Liverpool stood firm before Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach. The club subsequently attempted to renew his contract, which was due to expire in 2027, but with no prospect of an agreement and Bayern improving their bid with achievable add-ons, Liverpool reluctantly agreed to his sale. Díaz played a key role in the club’s 20th league title triumph last season and scored 17 goals in all competitions.
Díaz is the third most expensive transfer in Bayern’s history, behind Harry Kane and Lucas Hernández. He is also the third biggest sale in Liverpool’s history behind Philippe Coutinho and Luis Suárez, both of whom joined Barcelona.
“Three years and a half that I’ll treasure forever. I arrived with all the dreams in the world, and I am leaving proud of everything we achieved together,” Díaz posted on Instagram. “I have met incredible people, fabulous colleagues, coaches who helped me a lot, and extraordinary fans. Liverpool is, indeed, a special team, and I will keep everyone in my heart …
“It would have been the perfect goodbye if we hadn’t lost one of ours in such a tragic way,” Díaz added, referring to former teammate Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car accident earlier this month. “As I said, and I repeat, I carry everyone with me in my heart, but one of them in particular: Diogo. I will never forget him. We will never forget him. Thank you for everything. YNWA.”
Liverpool paid an initial €45m to sign Díaz from Porto in January 2022 with €15m payable in potential add-ons. Only €4m of those add-ons have been triggered and, with Porto holding no sell-on clause, Liverpool will make a profit of €26m on the deal.
The completion of Díaz’s move to Germany means Liverpool have raised more than £190m in player sales since Richard Hughes became sporting director in June 2024. The champions have spent almost £300m this summer, including add-ons, but remain interested in signing Isak should Newcastle show an inclination to sell their prized asset.
Liverpool accept it would take a British record transfer fee to bring the Sweden international to Anfield, a move the striker is understood to want, and are likely to have the finances to make it happen with Darwin Núñez, Harvey Elliott, Tyler Morton and Ben Doak all potentially leaving this summer.

Which two Premier League clubs have shared the most players?,Fifteen players have represented both Arsenal and Chelsea in the Premier League but that is not a record,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/30/premier-league-clubs-arsenal-chelsea-players-record,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 13:00:28",Premier League,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Noni Madueke has made the short journey across London to join Arsenal from Chelsea. Some Arsenal fans have expressed annoyance at their club giving yet more money – £52m – to their rivals for a player deemed surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge. The road from Chelsea to Arsenal is a well worn path. Kepa Arrizabalaga swapped south-west London for north London earlier this summer for £5m, following in the footsteps of Kai Havertz and Jorginho, who made the same move in 2023 for a combined £77m.
A total of 15 players have represented both Arsenal and Chelsea in the Premier League, with Havertz and Jorginho joining Ashley Cole, Cesc Fàbregas, Petr Cech, Olivier Giroud, David Luiz, Emmanuel Petit, Lassana Diarra, Nicolas Anelka, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Raheem Sterling, William Gallas, Willian and Yossi Benayoun.
That is still some way off the benchmark for the number of players to have represented two specific clubs in the Premier League – it’s a record shared by two other London sides. Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham have shared 24 players over the 33 years of the Premier League.
Only one of those 24 players made more than 100 Premier League appearances for both Spurs and Fulham: Simon Davies, who joined Spurs from Peterborough United in April 2000. After playing 121 league games for Spurs, the former Wales winger moved to Everton before finishing his career at Fulham, where he made 137 appearances across six seasons.
Davies joins Clint Dempsey, Steed Malbranque, Danny Murphy, Paul Konchesky, Bobby Zamora, Sean Davis, Louis Saha, Mousa Dembélé, Dimitar Berbatov, Ryan Sessegnon, Stephen Kelly, Carlos Vinícius, Michael Brown, Scott Parker, Darren Bent, Wayne Routledge, Manor Solomon, Kasey Keller, Paul Stalteri, Lewis Holtby, Josh Onomah, Adel Taarabt and Eidur Gudjohnsen in having played for both clubs.
Aston Villa and Everton are second on the list, with 22 players having represented both clubs in the Premier League, including the division’s leading appearance maker, Gareth Barry, who played 365 games for Villa and 131 for Everton.
When it comes to goals, a record 15 players have scored for Liverpool and Aston Villa in the league: Philippe Coutinho, Emile Heskey, Patrik Berger, Stan Collymore, Peter Crouch, Milan Baros, James Milner, Christian Benteke, Oyvind Leonhardsen, Robbie Keane, Joe Cole, Stewart Downing, Danny Ings, Dean Saunders and Stephen Warnock.
Just one of those 15 players reached double figures for both clubs: the evergreen James Milner, who scored 12 for Villa and 19 for Liverpool. Milner has also netted league goals for Leeds, Newcastle and Manchester City – but not his current club Brighton.
Crouch (22 goals for Liverpool and six for Villa) and Keane (five for Liverpool and three for Villa) are part of an elite group of 10 players who have scored for six or more clubs in the Premier League, with Craig Bellamy the only player in the league’s history to have scored for seven: Coventry, Newcastle, Blackburn, Liverpool, West Ham, Manchester City and Cardiff City.
