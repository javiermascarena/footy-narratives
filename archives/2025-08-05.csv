Ekitike's Anfield debut & Nunez's future - Liverpool wins vs Athletic Club assessed,Liverpool secured back-to-back wins in a friendly double header against Athletic Club at Anfield on Monday. Here we examine some of the big talking points from their performance...,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13407066/liverpool-rio-ngumoha-hugo-ekitike-and-darwin-nunez-assessed-after-back-to-back-wins-against-athletic-club,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 21:58:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool secured back-to-back wins in a friendly double header against Athletic Club at Anfield on Monday. Here we examine some of the big talking points from their performance...
Both ahead of and since Hugo Ekitike's arrival at Anfield, the transfer has been met with questions as to how best the French forward fits into Arne Slot's plans but as he told LFCTV after the game, he is ""here to win"" regardless of where he plays.
A fee that could potentially rise to £78m removes any idea that the 23-year-old is bench-bound at Liverpool and is suggestive of a heightened role.
Interest in Alexander Isak has prompted further debate but in setting up Salah's opener, Ekitike showed he's more than just your typical No 9.
Down the left, after interchanging with Cody Gakpo, his skill and pass into Salah showed he's more than capable of slotting in to Slots' fluid front line.
""I am still trying to find connections with the others,"" Ekitke told LFCTV.
""But I enjoy playing with them. It is a pleasure to play with them; we have little things to fix, but I really enjoy playing with them.""
If the early signs are anything to go by, the Premier League will have much to fear when he eventually does find connections, as he already looks to have made Anfield home.William Bitibiri
""Rio [Ngumoha] is showing good things in every game in pre-season,"" said Arne Slot to LFCTV after the game.
That is a fairly understated assessment of the 16-year-old sensation from the Liverpool boss. Not only does he bring composure, quality and drive with the ball whenever he is in possession, he also sparks a wave of excitement among the supporters.
A rare gift in football, which is even more uncommon with players at the very early stages of their careers.
Without looking to pile too much pressure on someone who cannot even drive a car yet, he feels like the real deal.
Luis Diaz's exit to join Bayern Munich now provides the perfect opportunity for Slot to slowly integrate Ngumoha into the first team picture this season.
He only needed five minutes to register a goal and assist in this fixture. If he is given regular opportunities in the senior side this season, I think it could become quite a common occurrence for the young talent.Patrick Rowe
The embarrassment of riches within this Liverpool squad is immense. However, if you were going to pick one area where they seem light, it is at centre back.
Captain Virgil van Dijk missed this fixture due to illness and should be fit for the Premier League opener against Bournemouth, live on Sky Sports, on August 15. But more depth is needed.
Jarell Quansah's sale to Bayer Leverkusen and Joe Gomez's injury meant Wataru Endo started alongside Ibrahim Konate in the second fixture at Anfield.
Was it really a surprise when both of Athletic's goals came from set pieces? They missed Van Dijk's presence, leadership and physicality at the back.
""Two set-piece goals is not what you want, especially when you face Crystal Palace next week. It is something to work on,"" said Slot to LFCTV.
The investment in the squad has already been huge this summer and will likely continue. Aside from the saga involving Isak, signing a centre back to provide cover or competition for Konate and Van Dijk should be the priority.Patrick Rowe
Both Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott face uncertain futures at Liverpool, but everything from their respective performances to the reception from the Anfield crowd, you wouldn't be able to tell.
The pair started in the earlier 4-1 win over Athletic Club with Nunez scoring the second, displaying his striker's instinct as he tapped home a cushioned header from Ngumoha.
The Uruguay international's involvement didn't stop there as he teed up Elliott's goal with a neat touch and pass.
Sky Sports News understands that AC Milan are the latest side to be keen on Nunez's signature, but there's no love lost for the striker who walked through the doors from Benfica for a then-club record fee.
As for Elliott, he grabbed the badge and blew a kiss to the crowd, which may provide some indication as to where his head is at on his future at the club despite reported interest from elsewhere.William Bitibiri

Isak reports to Newcastle training ground after Liverpool bid rejected,Alexander Isak reported to Newcastle's training ground on Monday after his personal training camp in Spain - days after a bid from Liverpool of over &#163;100m was rejected by the Magpies.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13406680/alexander-isak-transfer-news-newcastle-striker-back-at-training-ground-after-liverpool-bid-of-over-100m-rejected,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 10:00:00",,['Liverpool'],"Alexander Isak reported to Newcastle's training ground on Monday after his personal training camp in Spain - days after a bid from Liverpool of over £100m was rejected by the Magpies.
The striker was back at Newcastle's facility on Monday morning after arriving back in the UK from Spain on Saturday afternoon.
Isak spent more than three hours inside and Sky Sports News understands he was receiving treatment for his thigh issue.
Eddie Howe and the rest of the Newcastle squad were not present as they recover from an overnight flight back from South Korea.
Isak had been training at his former club Real Sociedad's headquarters on his own, after missing Newcastle's pre-season tour of Asia.
Sky Sports News understands Liverpool's opening offer for Isak on Friday was £110m plus add-ons. However, the total offer did not reach £120m.
Newcastle do not want to sell, and value Isak at £150m. On Saturday morning, Newcastle made a £70m offer to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko as they attempt to line up a replacement for Isak, should he leave.
Marcel Schafer, RB Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed on Saturday that clubs have made approaches for Sesko, who is also wanted by Manchester United.
""We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,"" said Schafer.
The rest of the Newcastle squad are due back from their pre-season tour of Asia on Monday.
On Saturday, head coach Howe confirmed the club have turned down a bid from Liverpool for Isak, but is unsure on what will happen next.
""I am very much removed from anything that's happening back home,"" Howe said.
""I was made aware that there was a bid [on Friday] - that bid was turned down all before I even heard about it. There's people back in England dealing with the situation.
""I really don't know what's going to happen next, but from our perspective we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.""
Howe revealed that he only found out about Isak training in Spain through the media and not from the player himself.
""I know where he is now - through the media,"" said Howe. ""So I think from that perspective, it is difficult to go into any type of detail.""
The 25-year-old has informed Newcastle that he wants to explore his options in this transfer window after Liverpool previously made an informal approach for him.
Liverpool play at Newcastle in the Premier League - live on Sky Sports - on August 25 on Monday Night Football.
Sky Sports Data Editor Adam Smith:
Alexander Isak scored 23 goals in the Premier League last season - second only to Mohamed Salah.
The Sweden international also outperformed his expected goals (20.42), underlining his elite-level finishing and composure in front of goal.
The 25-year-old consistently finds space around the penalty spot, where he converts a high proportion of his shots. But he's far more than a poacher: six of his 36 efforts from outside the box found the net - demonstrating his range and technique.
The chart below benchmarks Isak's per-90 stats against other strikers in Europe's top five leagues. He excels across a wide spectrum - from goalscoring and dribbling, to opposition-box entries and link-up play.
Newcastle have made a formal bid to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko.
Sky Sports News understands the offer is €75m (£65.5m) plus €5m (£4.3m) in add-ons - which matches Leipzig's valuation.
Newcastle have presented their vision to the Slovenian striker and want the deal to happen.
Sesko is considering his options with Manchester United also at the table. The player is open to both projects and remains a top target for Manchester United.
It was thought Man Utd would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. Whilst the priority is to offload players, it's understood Man Utd can buy before selling - provided there are sales before the window closes.
It's understood RB Leipzig are interested in Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan.
Howe added that Newcastle are only ""looking for the best"" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.
Not only have the Magpies been hit with Isak's desire to leave, but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.
Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Yoane Wissa, although the Brentford striker was not part of their squad to face QPR in a friendly on Saturday as he continues to push for a move.
With Callum Wilson having departed earlier this summer, Will Osula is the only recognised first-team striker on their pre-season tour of Asia.
""We're looking for the best players that we can get,"" said Howe. ""Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us.
""I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.
""It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change til the window shuts.""

Papers: Newcastle hoping to hijack Liverpool's bid for Guehi,The top stories and transfer rumours from Tuesday's newspapers...,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13407060/newcastle-hoping-to-hijack-liverpools-bid-for-crystal-palace-defender-marc-guehi-paper-talk,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 22:00:00",,['Liverpool'],"The top stories and transfer rumours from Tuesday's newspapers...
Newcastle are hoping to hijack Liverpool's bid to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi.
Real Madrid star Rodrygo has reportedly decided to stay and fight for his place at the Bernabeu this season, despite strong interest from Premier League clubs Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham.
Antony has turned down the chance to leave Manchester United for the third time this summer as he holds out for a return to Real Betis.

Newcastle are back in for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi with Eddie Howe set for Alexander Isak talks.
AC Milan and Al-Hilal expected to bid for Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez.


Chelsea have had a day of breakthroughs in sales with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Lesley Ugochukwu and Armando Broja all closing in on permanent departures to fellow Premier League clubs.
Newcastle are pushing ahead to agree a deal with RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko after being given encouragement the striker wants to join.
Bernie Ecclestone has urged Lewis Hamilton to quit Formula One immediately, and to get his Ferrari contract paid out in full before 'anything bad' happens to him.
Raheem Sterling heads a list of NINE Chelsea players who are out of the first-team picture - literally. The former England international, 30, and eight other stars do not even have a profile or photo in the first-team section of the Blues' official website.
Andros Townsend has signed for Thai club Kanchanaburi Power, marking a move to the 16th different club of his career.
Ian Poulter is in danger of imminent relegation from LIV Golf, after the league issued a stark warning that, this time, there will be no safety net for those who finish in the bottom places - regardless if they are a team captain or not.
FIFA is facing a class-action lawsuit over its transfer rules that could include claims from every professional footballer who has played in the European Union or the United Kingdom since 2002, according to the newly created Dutch foundation behind the move.

Chelsea aiming to sign Simons and Garnacho this summer,Chelsea are aiming to sign both Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho before the transfer window closes.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13401889/alejandro-garnacho-xavi-simons-transfer-news-chelsea-aiming-to-sign-man-utd-and-rb-leipzig-forwards-this-summer,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 14:10:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea are aiming to sign both Xavi Simons and Alejandro Garnacho before the transfer window closes.
Chelsea are in talks to sign the two forwards, and discussions have been ongoing for some time, with good relations between all the clubs.
Simons was not in RB Leipzig's squad for their friendly on Saturday.
Sky Sports News reported last month that Bayern Munich are also interested in Simons, who has two years left on his contract.
Meanwhile, Garnacho is one of several players that Manchester United are looking to move on this summer.
United, who are expecting formal offers for Garnacho later in the window, are aware of Chelsea's interest in the forward, whose future is likely to be away from Old Trafford.
Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim said over the weekend to journalists in the USA that ""it's clear Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership"".
Amorim believes Garnacho is still a talented player but says things have not worked out for the 21-year-old academy graduate at Old Trafford.
""You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out,"" said Amorim.
""You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.
""Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.""
Amorim also revealed that sales this summer are important because he wants a smaller squad this season, given United are not in Europe and will only fight on three fronts.
""I'm really happy with the team,"" said Amorim. ""Without European competitions, I want a small squad so everyone feels really important.
""If you have a lot of players, you have one week to prepare and a lot of players are going to be out, and then in training they will be frustrated and then the quality of the training will drop.""
Chelsea have agreed to a restriction on registering new players for UEFA competitions in the 2025/26 season, unless the value of new signings added to their squad is recouped in sales, after being fined - along with Aston Villa - by UEFA for breaches of its financial rules.
Chelsea have spent more than £250m this summer on eight new signings, with Ajax defender Jorrel Hato their latest addition, and there will be more incomings as players are sold and loaned out.
Nine players have left the club permanently, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Armando Broja, Carney Chukwuemeka, Marc Guiu and Lesley Ugochukwu also expected to leave Stamford Bridge.
Christopher Nkunku, Ben Chilwell and Raheem Sterling are also likely to leave, and question marks remain over the future of Nicolas Jackson.
Chelsea returned for pre-season training on Monday after having three weeks off since winning the Club World Cup.
Before their season opener against Crystal Palace on Sunday August 17, live on Sky Sports, Chelsea play Bayer Leverkusen on Friday and AC Milan on Sunday at Stamford Bridge.

Levy: Frank doesn't need to win PL this year - but must deliver ASAP,"Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy says Thomas Frank does not need to win the Premier League title this season - but he does need to deliver it ""as soon as possible"".",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13406692/daniel-levy-tottenham-hotspur-chairman-says-thomas-frank-does-not-need-to-win-the-premier-league-this-season-but-must-deliver-soon,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 11:00:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy says Thomas Frank does not need to win the Premier League title this season - but he does need to deliver it ""as soon as possible"".
This summer, Levy made the controversial decision to sack Europa League-winning boss Ange Postecoglou due to a 17th-placed Premier League finish, replacing him with the former Brentford boss.
After appointing Frank, Levy made the declaration that winning the Europa League was not enough - as he wanted Spurs to win the Premier League and Champions League.
In conversation with Gary Neville for The Overlap, Levy said Frank is not under immediate pressure to win the league, but that pressure may soon come.
""Whenever you appoint a coach, you always believe it's right,"" Levy said. ""You need a lot of ingredients for it to be right.
""Thomas is a highly intelligent individual, a fantastic way about him in terms of communication. I think he will be great at both developing young players and older players and making them better. He gets the style of football we want to play.
""He understands Rome wasn't built in a day. We haven't said to him that we want to win the Premier League this year.""
Asked when Frank is expected to win the league, Levy replied: ""As soon as possible, but no pressure. We just want to compete at the highest level.""
Levy stole the headlines when he revealed Spurs' desire to win the Premier League and the Champions League - something the club have never done in their history.
Spurs came close under Mauricio Pochettino via a second-placed Premier League finish in 2017 and reached the Champions League final in 2019.
Asked what has changed to make him say that, Levy replied: ""Nothing has changed in terms of our ambition. It's always been the case. After winning the Europa League, thanks to Ange, we've got a taste of it, but it's not enough. And it's never been enough.
""We've been in 16 or 17 semi-finals, we've been in six or seven finals and we haven't won enough. We need to use that as a springboard to keep winning, that's what it's all about. We've won two trophies in the last 20+ years.
""We've been so close so many times. I can't really answer why because I'm not the one that picks the team, picks the players.""
Spurs sacked Postecoglou despite delivering the club's first trophy in 17 years - and only the second of the Levy era at the north London club.
The Australian coach delivered on his promise to always win a trophy in his second season - and even declared that ""season three is better than season two"" during the club's Europa League trophy parade, before his sacking.
""Of course, the decision always has to rest with me,"" said Levy. ""But it's always a collective decision. We have a board of directors but under that we have a group of technical staff and they advise.
""Ange just won us a trophy, a European trophy. It's highly significant, it will always be in our history and we were asking him to leave. But we can't lose sight of the fact we finished 17th in the league, we lost 22 Premier League games. It's impossible for Tottenham to be in that position.
""We had to take the emotion out of it and we had to give some data points as to why we decided to do what we did.
""No one likes telling someone they're losing their job. But it's the nature of football. We're there to win. We won a European trophy and it was fantastic. But we also need to win on all fronts. The Premier League says it all.""
Levy also addressed criticism over his ownership, amid regular protests from Spurs fans against both him and the ENIC Group, which also has a stake in the club.
The 63-year-old believes his role in building the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium means he will only get credit for his work once he has left the club - before adding that he shares in the Spurs fans' pain when they do not succeed on the pitch.
""When I'm not here, I'm sure I'll get the credit,"" said Levy.
""When you come here and look at this wonderful building - and the fact that other clubs are trying to copy what we're doing - it should be a sign that we did something a bit bold and right.
""Of course [fan unrest] hurts, but their pain is also my pain. I want to win and when we're not playing well and not winning, believe me - I suffer as well.
""It ruins my whole weekend. It's horrible. You're in this to win. When you don't win, it's not fun.""
One of the criticisms Levy gets is an overinvolvement in the football side of the club, despite a strong track record in the commercial success of Spurs.
Asked if that criticism is fair, Levy replied: ""I would say that's completely unfair. People who have worked in this club and understand the workings of the football side of this club, I do not interfere at all in the decision-making of this player versus that player. It is always the coach and the technical staff.
""The only way I get involved is when they decide which player they want to buy or sell, I will go out and do my very best for this football club. But I'm not interfering in the football decisions.
""It's not different from any other club. It's not just me, it's a board. When we went through the decision to appoint Thomas, there were a number of people involved, in which I was just one of them.""
On whether Thomas Frank will be backed in the transfer market...
""We will support him to the best of our ability. If you look at transfer fees, we've been in the top four spenders since the stadium opened. We've spent around £700m net on new players.
""This isn't just about money, it's about some luck, having the right balance in the team, having the right coach. A lot of things have to come together.
""I very much hope Thomas brings all the right ingredients to put the club where it deserves, which is right at the top.""
On whether the Europa League triumph is his best achievement at Spurs...
""It has to be. Also when we came back here a few days later and did the parade. The outpouring of emotion for everyone to see around the world was amazing.
""It was nothing to do with the money, it was all about [that] we needed a trophy. I promise you. The money, you realise a few days later that we're in the Champions League. But it was about getting a trophy. It's my proudest moment.""
What is success for Spurs in the next three years?
""We need to compete at the highest level, we need to consistently try to win trophies. That's what it's all about.
On Man City's financial charges with the Premier League…
""It's going through a process which has gone on for far too long. It has to be brought to a conclusion for the good of the game.
""It's unfortunate that we haven't been able to sort things internally. [The reason why it's taking so long is] the lawyers, the lawyers are going to earn a lot of money over this.""

'Excellent prospect' Ngumoha stars for Liverpool - but who is he?,Liverpool's second youngest ever player Rio Ngumoha shines again in pre-season to get fans wondering if he could be part of the first team this year.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gmevn5ye0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 21:00:52",Emlyn Begley,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool's big summer signings made their Anfield bows - but it was 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha who stole the show despite not playing in the same game as them.
The Reds played an unusual double header against Athletic Bilbao, with - loosely speaking - their second XIs meeting at 17:00 BST and their first teams facing off at 20:00.
England Under-17 forward Ngumoha started the first game - and had a goal and assist to his name in the opening five minutes.
It ended 4-1 with Darwin Nunez, Ben Doak and Harvey Elliott also on the scoresheet.
Later on in the first-team game, Arne Slot fielded £263.5m worth of summer signings.
They were midfielder Florian Wirtz, forward Hugo Ekitike, full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez and goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili - whose deal has gone through a year after it was agreed.
But it was Cody Gakpo who probably earned the headlines - scoring twice in the right net, and once in his own goal, as Liverpool won 3-2. Mohamed Salah netted the opener and later skied a penalty.
""In both games we created a lot of chances and scored seven goals. That's very pleasing to see,"" said boss Slot.
'Hard to put a lid on' Ngumoha hype
Ngumoha, who turns 17 later this month, shone again in pre-season to get fans wondering if he could be part of the first team this year.
The second youngest Liverpool player in a competitive game ever started this friendly on the left wing - and he caught the eye as he has done all summer.
The teenager scored in just the second minute as he ran onto a loose ball in his own half before racing forward and curling a fine effort in from 20 yards out.
Just three minutes later he nodded a Doak cross down for Darwin Nunez to convert from close range.
Liverpool fans were singing his name as Curtis Jones urged them to show their appreciation.
And he caused the La Liga side all kinds of problems with his dribbling and trickery.
The 16-year-old left to a standing ovation midway through the second half.
""He is such an excellent prospect,"" said ex-Reds defender Gary Gillespie on LFC TV.
""The difficult is managing expectations but it's hard to put a lid on it.""
Slot said: ""Rio is showing things every time in pre-season.""
Ngumoha's performance came on the back of an assist against AC Milan and goal against Yokohama F. Marinos in Asian friendlies.
He looks a fine talent, if raw, and will be hoping more first-team competitive games are on the way.
In January, Ngumoha became the youngest player to start a match for Liverpool  - aged 16 years and 135 days old - in the 4-0 win over Accrington in the FA Cup.
But that was his only first-team appearance and he never made the bench for a Premier League game.
That could well change this season, especially with so many changes in the Liverpool front line.
The sad death of centre forward Diogo Jota in a car crash has been the main focus of Liverpool's pre-season. There were tributes to him before and during the game at Anfield.
Winger Luis Diaz was sold to Bayern Munich and Nunez is a target for Saudi Pro League clubs.
An exit for Nunez would mean the Reds' only really strong frontline options would be Salah, new signing Ekitike and Gakpo - giving a chance for somebody like Ngumoha to break through.
That is unless they managed to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak. An initial bid of £110m has been rejected.
""I'm not trying to rush because I'm still only young,"" said Ngumoha last week.
""But at the same time, I just want to show the manager what I can do and not get too complacent. I just want to do bigger and better things for me and the club.""
Ngumoha is not actually a Liverpool academy product, having only joined Liverpool from Chelsea's youth set-up last summer.
At the time Blues legend John Terry wrote ""this boy is and will be a top player"".
He's not looking wrong.
Slot's Liverpool 2.0 show promising signs
Slot managed the remarkable achievement of winning the Premier League title in his first season despite barely making a signing - only fringe player Federico Chiesa arrived.
But now he is building a team of his own. And the signs are promising in a fluid looking 4-2-3-1.
The £100m Germany attacking midfielder Wirtz shown some exciting flashes in the first half with some great touches - and went close to scoring on a few occasions.
At right-back Frimpong had similarities to his predecessor Trent Alexander-Arnold, now at Real Madrid - better at attacking than defending.
The Dutchman got up and down the flank well at Anfield here - although did not deal with a free-kick into the box which led to Oihan Sancet's equaliser.
Ex-Bournemouth left-back Kerkez looked good. Ekitike was lively and ran to the byeline before setting up Salah's opener.
The Frenchman almost netted his first Anfield goal but Gakpo took the ball off his foot to score his second of the game.
Well his third including the accidental header into his own net from a Maroan Sannadi flick-on.
A concern remains at centre-back. With Virgil van Dijk out through illness and Joe Gomez injured, midfielder Wataro Endo had to start at the back alongside Ibrahima Konate.
After that the choices are other players out of position or youngsters. Or both. In the first game, 18-year-old midfielder Trey Nyoni had to play there.
""Today we hardly conceded anything at all [in terms of chances] which pleased me,"" said Slot.
""But to concede from two set-pieces is not what we want, especially against Palace next week [in the Community Shield]. They're strong at set-pieces. Another thing to work on.""

Liverpool legend Phil Thompson and Athletic president Jon Uriarte brought wreaths out on to the pitch and laid them on the edge of the six-yard box before the opening game.
The billboards around Anfield read 'Rest in Peace Diogo Jota and Andre Silva - You'll Never Walk Alone', while fans sang about Jota.
Reds supporters also held up flags and banners remembering their number 20 - a number that has been retired by the club this summer.
Both sets of players, coaches and fans applauded as both games were stopped in the 20th minute.
Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the Reds, helping them win the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup, following his arrival from Wolves in 2020.
""I know that you will want to pay your tributes before, during and after the games, and I know that we will hear his song ringing out throughout the evening,"" said Reds boss Arne Slot in his match programme notes.
""It has been a tough time for everyone connected with the club, but especially for Diogo's family, his wife, his children and friends.
""We cannot imagine the pain that they have been going through, and the club will continue to give them all the support they can going forward. We will always carry him with us in our hearts, in our thoughts, wherever we go.
""Diogo's passing has had a big impact on us all, but what has been so important has been the love and care shown from the football world, and in particular of course the Liverpool FC community.""
The Reds play Crystal Palace in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday and open the Premier League season at Anfield against Bournemouth on Friday, 15 August.

Everton agree £28m deal for Chelsea's Dewsbury-Hall,Everton agree to sign Chelsea midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in a deal worth around £28m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c7vlzjd3nero?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 14:42:56",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Everton have agreed to sign Chelsea midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in a deal worth around £28m.
The fee for the 26-year-old is an initial £24m with a further £3-4m due in add-ons, and he will now finalise personal terms and undergo a medical despite late interest from Fulham.
Dewsbury-Hall had initially been reluctant to leave Stamford Bridge after a season playing in a supporting role as the side won the Fifa Club World Cup and Uefa Conference League, as well as qualifying for the Champions League.
However, the Blues were open to letting the midfielder go as they look to recoup the vast majority of the £30m it took to prise him from Leicester City in 2024, where he rejoined Enzo Maresca who also left the Foxes to manage Chelsea.
Everton have also been in negotiations with Southampton for winger Tyler Dibling, but are considering walking away if the valuation for the 19-year-old doesn't drop after a second bid was rejected.
In manager David Moyes's final press conference at the Premier League Summer Series, he said: ""I think there'll be deals next week. I think we're getting much closer, but I felt that four or five weeks ago as well.
""Obviously, we're getting near the tickly bits and we've got to get some things done.""
Following the signing of Dutch defender Jorrel Hato from Ajax on Sunday, Chelsea are negotiating multiple sales this week.
French midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu, 21, has agreed to join Burnley, who are also in advanced talks with their Albanian forward Armando Broja, 23.
Borussia Dortmund have also re-opened negotiations for midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka as the Blues look to trim their squad.
Did Dewsbury-Hall fail at Chelsea?
Dewsbury-Hall found it difficult to adapt to life at Chelsea despite working with Maresca again.
Having starred in Leicester's Championship-winning campaign, he was hopeful of playing in the Premier League with his boyhood club. So much so that he rejected a move to Brighton to stay with the Foxes.
However, Chelsea's move in late June was too big to turn down, especially as Leicester were pushing for the £30m sale - which also involved a swap with teenage midfielder Michael Golding going in the other direction - amid pressure to meet the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability (PSR) requirements.
Dewsbury-Hall adapted well to Maresca's system at Chelsea, but not to playing a bit-part role as Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Enzo Fernandez all featured ahead of him in the midfield pecking order.
He started only twice in the Premier League but made an impact, eventually, in their Conference League run, where he scored four times and came off the bench to set up Jadon Sancho's goal in the 4-1 triumph over Real Betis in May's final.
Dewsbury-Hall was used mainly as a substitute in the Club World Cup, but scored his fifth goal for the club in a 4-1 victory over Benfica and appeared in the 3-0 final success over Paris St-Germain.
He was a decent performer when given a chance for the Stamford Bridge side, but became part of a trend of players moving quickly in and then out again.
The sale of Dewsbury-Hall is particularly important as Uefa's recent punishment for financial control violations suggests Chelsea must sell players from their last Conference League squad to ensure a ""positive transfer balance"" this summer.
If not, they can't register new signings like Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens and Liam Delap for the Champions League by September.
Chelsea are also still looking to strengthen their midfield options for next season, with talks ongoing for RB Leipzig's Netherlands international Xavi Simons.

Might Newcastle owner's cash help Liverpool buy Isak?,"With PIF-owned Al-Hilal interested in Darwin Nunez, could Newcastle's owners be paving the way for Alexander Isak's move to Liverpool?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce83vqqll00o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 14:56:56",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"The Saudi Pro League is emerging as a possible destination for Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez this summer.
BBC Sport understands that a potential move to the Middle East for the Uruguay international has been explored this summer with intermediaries actively working on trying to broker a deal.
Al-Hilal, who are controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and coached by former Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi, are interested in Nunez.
And offloading Nunez would financially aid Liverpool's efforts to land striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle - another club owned by PIF - this summer.
So, would PIF be allowing one of their clubs to benefit at the expense of another if Al-Hilal sign Nunez?
'What is PIF's priority?'
There is some uncertainty over whether Nunez, 26, is prepared to leave European football at this stage in his career.
Nunez has also been a target for Italian champions Napoli this summer while other European sides have shown an interest.
PIF owns 75% stakes in four of the leading Saudi Arabian clubs, including Al-Hilal, while it also owns a 80% stake in Newcastle.
The Magpies rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool for Isak on Friday, with Newcastle valuing the Sweden international at about £150m.
""It makes me think about what the priority is for PIF,"" Newcastle fan writer Charlotte Robson told BBC Sport.
""More and more discontent has been felt in the fanbase lately over where Newcastle sit on PIF's list of priorities, and allowing another of their clubs to benefit at the potential expense of us feels even more like we are being overlooked.
""Perhaps it's their clever way of getting money into NUFC, but I think most fans would say we'd rather an improved contract was given to Isak, the dust of the summer settles, and he stays with us a little while longer.""
'Liverpool can afford Isak without Nunez money'
However, football finance expert Kieran Maguire says Liverpool can afford to buy Isak regardless of whether Nunez stays or leaves.
""Although they've been very active in the transfer window, if they really wanted to, they could have spent another £200-250m, and still would have been within the PSR [profit and sustainability rules] limits,"" he told BBC Sport.
Liverpool have signed Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili and Armin Pecsi for a combined total of about £265m without add-ons.
However, the departures of Luis Diaz, Jarell Quansah, Caoimhin Kelleher and Trent Alexander-Arnold have recouped an initial £115m.
Maguire added: ""I think people are joining the dots and perhaps making two plus two equals five in terms of, is this a 'you scratching my back? I'll scratch yours' type of situation. But in my view, there's insufficient evidence to back that up.
""I suspect that Liverpool are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this, rather than a PIF club. Newcastle don't want to sell Isak.
""As far as Al-Hilal are concerned, there are plenty of strikers that they could have bought. It just so happens that Nunez is effectively available, and therefore they decided to pursue that as an option.""
What's the latest on Isak?
Isak joined Newcastle in a £60m move from La Liga side Real Sociedad in 2022.
He was the club's top scorer last season as they won the Carabao Cup, ending their 70-year wait for domestic silverware.
The 25-year-old, who was reported as wanting to explore a move away from Tyneside by BBC Sport in July, was left out of the club's pre-season tour of Asia with what the club called a ""minor thigh injury"".
Last week, the Sweden international trained alone at his former club Real Sociedad amid ongoing uncertainty about his future, although sources say he returned to Newcastle training on Monday.
His boss Eddie Howe said Isak must ""earn the right"" to train with his squad again and, speaking to the Newcastle Chronicle, said he had not spoken to the forward since Liverpool lodged a bid.
The Newcastle boss, speaking before he travelled back home with his squad from South Korea, added that Liverpool, as far as he was aware, had not been back in touch since making their offer.

Rio Ngumoha shines to fuel Liverpool’s optimism for new season,Young winger showed great promise in the 4-1 rout of Athletic Bilbao as Anfield paid its respects to Diogo Jota,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/04/rio-ngumoha-liverpool-athletic-bilbao-diogo-jota,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 19:30:11",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"A vacancy has arisen on the left of Liverpool’s forward line and an early, eye-catching application to fill the role has arrived from a 16-year-old. Rio Ngumoha further enhanced his first‑team claims with a sparkling display against Athletic Bilbao that underlined the formidable strength, and options, available to Arne Slot.
Ngumoha opened the scoring superbly and teed up a goal for Darwin Núñez inside five minutes at Anfield in the first of two pre-season friendlies against the Basque club.
A packed Anfield crowd had to wait for the second fixture to catch a first glimpse of new signings Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Ekitiké and Jeremie Frimpong. Ngumoha kept them entertained before then as Liverpool recorded a comfortable 4-1 win in match one. The second game also went Liverpool’s way, a 3-2 victory in which Wirtz, Ekitiké and Frimpong added to the flowing, blistering quality of the champions’ attacking play.
Ngumoha is not eligible to sign a professional contract until he turns 17 on the 29th of this month but showed why Chelsea were livid when Liverpool tempted him away from their academy last summer. In only the second minute of his second senior appearance at Anfield the teenager, who made his full debut against Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup last season, set off from halfway and, with Athletic defenders all in retreat, curled an excellent finish into the bottom corner of the Kop goal from 20 yards.
The left winger produced something similar in Liverpool’s previous pre‑season outing against Yokohama F Marinos last week. That goal came on the day Luis Díaz completed his £65.5m transfer to Bayern Munich, creating an opening on the left that could be filled by any one of Cody Gakpo, Wirtz, Ekitiké and perhaps the 16-year-old talent from London. His display was enough to prompt chants of “Rio” from the Kop and a song in his honour from the singer who appeared during the interval.
Ngumoha’s emergence – predicted with confidence by John Terry when he lamented the youngster’s exit from Chelsea – is timely for Liverpool as they await Newcastle’s next move on Alexander Isak. There may not be a rush to replace Díaz directly given the options already at Slot’s disposal. The Premier League champions can afford to wait on their prime target for the No 9 role and leave their £110m offer for Isak on Newcastle’s table.
Three minutes after his individual goal Ngumoha headed down a Ben Doak cross for Núñez to convert from close range. Anyone looking for clues as to Núñez’s next step – with Al-Hilal interested in taking him to the Saudi Pro League – will have noted the hand-on-the-heart celebration that followed from the £60m-rated Uruguay international in front of the Kop. A glimpse of Liverpool’s past and future, perhaps. Doak and Harvey Elliott, two other players who could leave Anfield in this window, were also on the scoresheet in the first contest against Ernesto Valverde’s side. Ngumoha’s footwork and pace also impressed in the 67 minutes he was on the pitch. He received a well-earned rousing reception when replaced by Trent Koné-Doherty.
The opening game started at 5pm as scheduled despite supporters in the Main Stand having to be evacuated just over an hour before kick-off due to a false alarm.
Liverpool’s first appearance on home soil since the tragic deaths of Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva, was marked by the club’s former captain Phil Thompson and Athletic president, Jon Uriarte, laying wreaths in front of the Kop before the game. There were moving moments 20 minutes into both games when everyone inside the stadium rose to their feet to applaud Liverpool’s No 20. Play stopped and players from both teams also joined in the applause for Jota and Silva.
Slot was without Virgil van Dijk for both Bilbao games due to illness. The Liverpool head coach indicated the club captain could be a doubt for Sunday’s Community Shield against Crystal Palace. Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez were also absent through injury, forcing Slot to deploy 18-year-old midfielder Trey Nyoni in central defence for the first Bilbao contest and Luca Stephenson at right-back.
Goalkeeper Alisson was unavailable having left Liverpool’s recent pre‑season tour of Asia due to personal reasons. Summer signings Freddie Woodman and Armin Pecsi filled in, playing one half each, while Georgia international Mamardashvili made his Anfield bow in the second game behind a central defence of Ibrahima Konaté and Wataru Endo. That is one department where the champions appear light at present. Ngumoha could add to their riches up front.

Everton push again for Dibling with £40m offer and target Chelsea’s Dewsbury-Hall,Southampton have rejected two Everton bids for winger,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/04/everton-tyler-dibling-kiernan-dewsbury-hall-chelsea-transfer-news,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 13:48:59",Andy Hunter,['Chelsea'],"Everton have raised their bid for Tyler Dibling to about £40m and opened talks with Chelsea over signing Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. Southampton have rejected two offers from Everton for the 19-year-old Dibling in recent days, of £27m and £35m, but Everton have returned with a third package worth iabout £40m including add-ons.
The England Under-21 international, who is believed to be open to joining Everton, has two years on his contract and Southampton are pushing for package nearer to £50m. They think others may come to the table.
Everton have missed out on several wide options this summer, including Francisco Conceição, who joined Juventus from Porto, and RB Leipzig’s recent signing from PSV, Johan Bakayoko. They also have interest in Lyon’s Malick Fofana, but the 20-year-old would prefer to join a club offering Champions League football.
David Moyes also wants to strengthen in central midfield and Dewsbury-Hall is a longstanding target. The 26-year-old started two Premier League games last season after his £30m arrival from Leicester and was deployed more often in Chelsea’s Conference League campaign. Everton have opened talks over a permanent deal, with Chelsea seeking to recoup their outlay.
Everton have completed four signings this summer – Carlos Alcaraz, the striker Thierno Barry, goalkeeper Mark Travers and the young left-back Adam Aznou – but 11 players have left, including nine members of last season’s first-team squad.

"Analyzing preseason friendlies is maddening, but right now it’s all we have | Jonathan Wilson","Every team enters preseason at a different stage of readiness and with different goals, making results hard to decipher",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/04/analyzing-pre-season-friendlies-is-maddening-but-right-now-its-all-we-have,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 15:57:26",Jonathan Wilson,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Glory for Manchester United, who lifted the Premier League summer series on Sunday despite twice being pegged back by Everton to draw 2-2 in Atlanta. A degree of relief for West Ham, who beat Bournemouth to finish second in the competition despite all the gloomy prognostications about their campaign to come. In Seoul, meanwhile, there was a very Tottenham moment as they followed the glee of last week’s 1-0 win over Arsenal with a 1-1 draw against Newcastle in which James Maddison was stretchered off with a knee injury described by his manager Thomas Frank as “bad”.
It all looks real, it sounds real and yet everybody knows it isn’t real. That even now, in this age of data and minute analysis, there remains an element of randomness, is one of soccer’s great joys as a sport. But that tendency is magnified in pre-season.
The Premier League has been away for 10 weeks now. For those hooked on its soap opera, the wait is intolerable. The Club World Cup, the England men’s team being dreadful in June as they so often are, the Under-21s continuing their unfamiliar excellence, even the women’s Euros … none of it quite offers the same hit. Obsessing over transfers suffices only for so long; eventually there is a need to see them play.
And so there are pre-season games, and there is is analysis. The best of it is skeptical, acknowledging the absurdity of making judgements on 45 minutes. The worst of it is breathlessly insistent – of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, the two senior players United have managed to sign, appearing together against Everton. What does it mean that Rasmus Højlund was only on the bench? Does that mean Benjamin Šeško is more likely to sign? The front three, with Mbeumo dropping deep and Cunha and Bruno Fernandes at times running beyond him, looked fluent. Fernandes and Mbuemo set up Amad Diallo, overlapping from wing-back to score the opener. This is the way Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-3 is supposed to work.
In that, at least, there is a sense of something tangible, a United that is, at last, able to execute their manager’s attacking plan. But Ayden Heaven’s own goal was a reminder that United remain as self-destructive as ever. Perhaps more significant was the equaliser conceded after Manuel Ugarte lost possession, the lack of urgency to get back. Did this happen because it was only a friendly and United are nowhere near peak fitness yet? Or because this is an irredeemably feckless bunch of players?
This is smoke on a foggy day. Will any of it be relevant when the season begins for real? United fans will remember ruefully just how good they looked in pre-season under Louis van Gaal in 2014, only for the season itself to prove anticlimactic.
The problem with assessing pre-season games is that different sides are at different stages of readiness. Some expect to hit the ground running from week one; others are building to peak in March or April, the differences magnified two weeks before the opening day. Some managers are working on specific plans and are less bothered by the whole, some are just hoping to get semi-competitive minutes into their players’ legs.

Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer
In the old days, before Premier League teams went on foreign tours and everybody was desperately promoting themselves to a global audience, pre-season was about team bonding as much as anything else: the team that drinks together wins together, as the adage had it. The stories are legion: the Everton winger Peter Beagrie driving a motorbike through a plateglass window in San Sebastián; Sunderland’s diminutive but extremely tough full-back John Kay terrifying a much larger local who had threatened him by casually eating the antiseptic cubes from a urinal in Bristol; Arsenal’s French midfielder Gilles Grimandi joining five of his English teammates on a night out in Switzerland where the first round comprised 35 pints of lager and a dry white wine. Many managers, you suspect, would quite relish a return to the days, if not of booze, then at least of pre-season being a largely private affair rather than a projection of the club to the world.
Very occasionally something consequential happens, such as Chelsea conceding four in the second half to an experimental New York Red Bulls led by Jesse Marsch in the summer of 2015, the first sign that something had gone badly wrong for José Mourinho’s side since winning the Premier League two months earlier; within five months, Mourinho had been sacked. (It was also the debut first-team appearance for Bournemouth and US national team midfielder Tyler Adams, then 16 years old.)
Pre-season is very much the phoney war, the jockeying, the probing. It matters to the clubs, but to outsiders it is essentially like watching an artist mix his paints. There’s anticipation and a vague technical interest, but it means nothing until it starts being applied to the canvas.

"Tottenham fans will only appreciate me when I am gone, says Daniel Levy",Chair says stadium has put club ‘on the global map’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/04/tottenham-hotspur-daniel-levy-spurs-thomas-frank-stadium,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 13:52:56",Ed Aarons,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"The Tottenham chair, Daniel Levy, believes he will get credit for his time in charge only when he leaves and is confident that Thomas Frank can help the club to “compete at the ­highest level”.
In a rare interview, Levy described the construction of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as his greatest achievement and hit back at fans who have blamed him for the club’s failure to win more trophies. “It’s one of those situations when I’m not here I’m sure I’ll get the credit,” Levy told Gary Neville on his Overlap podcast.
“This stadium is a symbol of ­Tottenham Hotspur on the global map. It’s fantastic for the local ­community – the employment we’re creating because of this stadium. The fact that other clubs are now trying to copy what we’re doing, that should be a sign that maybe we did do something bold and something right.”
The Europa League triumph last season was Spurs’ first trophy since 2008 and came just before the end of a Premier League campaign when they finished 17th after a record 22 defeats. Levy sacked Ange ­Postecoglou 16 days after the win against Manchester United in the final in Bilbao and he is hopeful that Frank can help the club to challenge for trophies on a more consistent basis.
“Whenever you appoint a coach, you always believe it’s right,” Levy said. “You need a lot of ­ingredients for it to be right. Thomas is a highly intelligent individual, a ­fantastic way about him in terms of communication.
“He will be great at ­developing young players and older players and making them better. He gets the style of football we want to play. We haven’t said to him: ‘You’ve got to win the league this year.’ We just want to compete at the highest level.”
Levy was critical of the Premier League for the time it has taken to conclude the case involving alleged breaches of the league’s regulations by Manchester City. The club, who deny wrongdoing, were charged in ­February 2023 with more than 130 breaches .
“It would be really unfair of me to talk about another club in the Premier League,” he said. “All I would say is that it’s going through a process which has gone on for far too long. It needs to be brought, for the good of the game, to a conclusion one way or another.”

Thomas Partey close to joining Villarreal in week of court appearance,Former Arsenal midfielder has denied rape charges,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/04/thomas-partey-villarreal-court-appearance,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 11:00:03",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"The former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey is poised to join Villarreal on a free transfer this week.
Partey is due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday after being charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault last month, a few days after he left Arsenal having failed to agree a new deal. He has denied all the charges.
Partey is understood to have completed his medical at Villarreal having settled on personal terms for a move back to Spain, where he has played for Atlético Madrid, Mallorca and Almería. He is believed to have agreed a one-year contract with an option to extend by 12 months, and the opportunity to play in the Champions League next season is thought to have been a motivating factor in the 32-year-old’s decision. Partey also had offers from Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
Arsenal are due to host Villarreal in a friendly on Wednesday. Some supporters of the Spanish club have voiced opposition to his expected move, with a hashtag #NoAThomasPartey (No to Thomas Partey) trending on X and others being encouraged to write to Villarreal to express disappointment.
Partey had been the subject of an investigation that began in February 2022, with the allegations relating to three women who reported incidents between 2021 and 2022. Partey’s lawyer has said her client “welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name”.
Partey continued to play for Arsenal after first being arrested on suspicion of rape in July 2022 and held talks about extending his contract after Mikel Arteta said he was keen for him to stay. Arsenal’s manager said last month he was “100%” sure Arsenal followed the correct protocols over Partey.

Due in no small part to their peerless work in the field of curing the ills of struggling and out-of-sorts opponents in need of a fillip, few Spurs fans would be sorry to see the back of Dr Tottenham if he ever decides to leave their club. But on Sunday in Seoul, during a pre-season friendly between the Bigger Vase champions and Newcastle, there was scarcely a dry eye in the house as Tottenham and their South Korean supporters’ branch bade an emotional farewell to a player who, over the past decade, has to all intents and purposes become Mr Tottenham. Substituted after 65 minutes of the 1-1 draw, an emotional Son Heung-min received warm hugs and a guard of honour from both his teammates and the players of Newcastle before retiring to the substitutes’ bench for a little weep. After 10 years of service, one of the most popular, high-performance and low-maintenance players to ever grace the Premier League is off to ply his trade in MLS with LAFC and an English football landscape so often synonymous with spittle-flecked and snarling rage will be considerably poorer for the absence of his trademark beatific beam.
“I didn’t think I was going to cry at first but after hearing a few words from my teammates, leaving the club I’ve spent so much time with felt really tough,” he sobbed. “I felt really, really happy playing this match. Thanks to my fans, my teammates and also my opponents, I’ve had an unforgettable day. My career is not over yet, and I want to continue to bring joy. I know I have more things I want to accomplish as a football player.” In his 454 appearances for Spurs, the man they call Son accomplished plenty. He scored 173 goals and provided 101 assists but such metrics don’t come even close to measuring his contribution to the club’s cause. On the pitch a graceful, lightning fast predator with the cold eye of an assassin, Son lifted Tottenham’s first trophy in 16 years last season and at other points during his time in north London, won a Puskás Award and shared a golden boot.
In arguably his greatest act of personal selflessness for the benefit of the greater Tottenham Hotspur good, he also made a complete dog’s breakfast of that one-on-one with Manchester City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to deny Arsenal the title two seasons ago. Off the pitch, it has long been apparent that Son is that rare breed of elite footballer who few people, except perhaps Arsenal fans in whose collective side he has been a constant thorn, has a bad word to say about. Among those shedding salty tears in Seoul was Ben Davies, the similarly long-serving Spurs player who is so close to the departing South Korean that – try saying this without slurring after a skinful – his son is Son’s godson. “I saw my good friend Ben Davies cry,” said Son in the post-match interview. “Seeing him tearing up with his eyes going all red made me feel sorry and thankful at the same time. A mixture of feelings really but as the godfather of his son, I need to strive for more, to make my godson proud.”
While Son’s rigid adherence to his duties as a moral guardian are to be commended, Football Daily is prepared to wager that as long as he remembers to pony up the obligatory readies each and every birthday, Davies Jr is unlikely to give two hoots whether or not he ever kicks a football again. “Sonny is Tottenham and Tottenham is Sonny,” declared James Maddison before the friendly, a game in which the midfielder was carried off the field on a stretcher after suffering a bad case of knee-knack. “It’s weird to think about Tottenham Hotspur without Son.” For those who continue to pass in and out of the gates of the Spurs training complex, it will also be weird not to see the small gaggle of South Koreans who regularly convene on the Enfield outskirts hoping to get a smile, a kind word or a selfie as Son comes and goes from training. Exceedingly rare were the days, by all accounts, when the subject of their unbridled adoration failed to oblige them.

It was crystal clear we needed more competition... hopefully we can get one or two players more” – Bruno Fernandes warms up for the new season with a familiarly downbeat refrain about Manchester United after a 2-2 draw with similarly underpowered Everton in Atlanta. They did win the Premier League Summer Series, mind. So cheer up, Bruno.
