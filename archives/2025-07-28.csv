Liverpool agree £65.5m deal to sell Diaz to Bayern,Liverpool have agreed a deal to sell Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13402612/luis-diaz-transfer-news-liverpool-agree-65-5m-deal-to-sell-winger-to-bayern-munich,"Sun, 27 Jul 2025 16:30:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have agreed a deal to sell Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich.
The total fee for the deal is £65.5m.
Diaz, who has two years remaining on his Liverpool contract, now has permission to leave the club's Asia tour. Sky Sports News understand he is expected to leave Tokyo on Monday to finalise the move to Bayern.
Liverpool rejected Bayern's initial advances and an offer believed to be in the region of £58.5m (€67m) but the German club returned with a second offer of £65.5m (€75m) including add-ons.
The Reds have accepted the offer after securing what the club considers to be full market value.
Throughout the summer, Liverpool had been unwilling to sell a key first-team player but Diaz and his representatives pushed for a move. He first signalled a wish to leave in the summer of 2024, but the club held firm while assessing both the squad and the market.
Two separate attempts from Liverpool to agree a contract extension failed due to a gap between offers and demands, and after Diaz helped deliver the club's 20th Premier League title, Liverpool reluctantly agreed to his request to leave.
Diaz joined Liverpool in January 2022 for a guaranteed £37.5m (€42.9m) payment, signing a five-and-a-half-year contract.
His departure does not alter Liverpool's recruitment plans with Hugo Ekitike already signed to strengthen the club's attacking depth.
On Saturday, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot confirmed that Diaz was left out of the squad to face AC Milan due to speculation surrounding his future, but Darwin Nunez missed out due to injury.
""One of the positions that we didn't have was a No 9,"" Slot told LFC TV after the 4-2 defeat.
""We had one, Hugo [Ekitike], but he wasn't ready to play yet. Darwin was injured. Lucho [Luis Diaz] couldn't play as well.""
Slot reiterated this with further comments, adding: ""In Lucho's situation it was, yeah [the reason why he was left out].
""There's a lot of rumours around him lately and I cannot go into that. He's training well with us but we have decided, for now, not to play him yet.
""I'm used to talking to most of my players on a regular basis. Like I said, Lucho is training really well and we've decided that he's not playing at the moment in the games. I cannot comment much more about that.""
Sky Sports News' Mark McAdam:
The fact that Liverpool made an approach for Isak last week suggests they were willing to pay a fee at least in the region of what Newcastle are looking for, which is around £150m.
But can they afford it?
In terms of player sales, Liverpool have generated more than £60m already.
The four players they've moved on this summer have either been academy players, who represent pure profit under PSR, or have been sold on for big profits.
Then, if you add in the likes of Diaz, Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott, those three players alone could raise another £150m. That would also create space in the forward line, potentially.
When you take that into account, their net spend potentially starts looking quite healthy, on top of being a really well-run club.

Bayern agree deal worth £65.5m with Liverpool for Diaz,Luis Diaz is set to join Bayern Munich after Bayern Munich agree a deal worth 75m euros (£65.5m) with Liverpool.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9qygz4r8jlo,"Sun, 27 Jul 2025 16:42:18",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Luis Diaz is set to join Bayern Munich after the German champions agreed a deal worth 75m euros (£65.5m) including add-ons with Liverpool.
Liverpool rejected an initial bid of £58.6m from Bayern for the Colombia forward earlier this month.
Diaz, 28, was left out of Liverpool's squad for Saturday's 4-2 pre-season friendly defeat by AC Milan in Hong Kong because of speculation surrounding his future.
He has been given permission by Liverpool to fly to Europe from Asia to complete a medical in the coming days.
Liverpool have signed forwards Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike already this summer and are interested in Newcastle United's Alexander Isak.
Diaz arrived at Anfield from Porto in a deal worth an initial £37m in January 2022 and has scored 41 goals in 148 appearances, including 13 as the Reds won the Premier League title last season.
His 17 goals in all competitions in 2024-25 was the most prolific season of his career.
Bayern won their 34th Bundesliga title last season and scored a league-high 99 goals, but only made it to the last 16 of the German Cup and exited the Champions League in the quarter-finals.
Diaz will provide an attacking option for the Bavarian side, who will be without forward Jamal Musiala for a ""long period"" after he suffered a broken leg and dislocated ankle at the Club World Cup.
Why Bayern want Diaz
It is easy to see why Diaz is an attractive prospect for Bayern.
Diaz's shot conversion rate of 18.3% in 24-25 comfortably ranked as his best in a Premier League season.
Many of his other attributes stood out statistically too.
Diaz sat just outside the top 10 in the Premier League for most combined goals and assists (18), shots on target (30), chances created (56) and dribbles completed (52).
His defensive attributes and work-rate are also evidenced by the fact he won possession in the final third on 22 occasions, more than any other Liverpool player relative to their time spent on the pitch.

Al-Nassr agree £43.7m deal for Chelsea forward Felix,Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr agree a deal worth up to £43.7m for Chelsea forward Joao Felix.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2q55jlq4eo,"Sun, 27 Jul 2025 18:52:40",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Al-Nassr have agreed a deal worth up to £43.7m for Chelsea forward Joao Felix.
The 25-year-old has been given permission to travel to Riyadh for his medical to complete the move.
Felix will link up with fellow Portugal international Cristiano Ronaldo at the Saudi Pro League side after they saw off interest from his former club Benfica.
Chelsea recoup the £45m they paid Atletico Madrid for Felix last summer, having also sent the attacker out on loan to AC Milan for six months in January for a £5m loan fee.
The Blues, who won the Club World Cup this month, have already sold goalkeepers Djordje Petrovic and Kepa Arrizabalaga and winger Noni Madueke to balance the books this summer.
They have raised about £130m with further players like forward Raheem Sterling, left-back Ben Chilwell, midfielder Renato Veiga and striker Armando Broja currently up for sale.
Chelsea have spent £212m on signings like striker Liam Delap, winger Jamie Gittens and forward Joao Pedro with interest in midfielder Xavi Simons and defender Jorrel Hato ongoing.
However, they are also under pressure from Uefa to come out of the summer with a ""positive transfer balance"" after being initially fined £27m with conditions placed on the club to comply with rules, or risk not being able to register new signings for the Champions League this season.

Portugal to Premier League - how will Gyokeres fare?,"Viktor Gyokeres is one of Europe's most prolific goalscorers, but can the Brighton flop do it at the very highest level after joining Arsenal?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c07d34mg321o,"Sun, 27 Jul 2025 11:06:05",Neil Johnston,['Arsenal'],"""I don't think he's the guy,"" Rio Ferdinand says of Viktor Gyokeres.
""I've watched him probably three times really, really closely. And three times I've gone: 'He ain't getting that opportunity in the Prem.'""
Sweden striker Gyokeres, 27, has just completed a move worth up to £64m from Sporting to Arsenal.
Gyokeres has scored a phenomenal 97 goals in 102 appearances for the Portuguese club, and contributed 26 assists.
He averaged more than a goal per game last season, with 54 in 52 appearances.
But when he was being linked with Manchester United, Ferdinand said he was not convinced Gyokeres was a good fit for a team in England's top flight.
The six-time Premier League winner, speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, asked: ""Is there enough - after he's physically matched - to get him a goal?""
However, Bjorn Hamberg, Gyokeres' former assistant coach at Brighton and fellow Swede, tells BBC Sport: ""He has got the physicality for sure.""
Arsenal were one of numerous top clubs linked with the former Brighton player after an outstanding couple of seasons with Sporting, where he played under Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim.
In addition to his 39 goals in Portugal's Primeira Liga in 2024-25, Gyokeres helped himself to another six in the Champions League - including a hat-trick against Manchester City.
He has gone from leaving Brighton without playing a single minute of Premier League football to becoming one of Europe's most prolific marksmen - via loan spells in the Championship at Swansea and Coventry, and in Germany with St Pauli.
But how have other players fared when moving from Portugal to England? And how will Gyokeres compare?
Do Portuguese league forwards usually succeed in England?
There is no doubt about the most successful import from the Primeira Liga - Cristiano Ronaldo, who also came from Sporting.
The 18-year-old, then a winger, joined Manchester United for £12.24m in August 2003.
He went on to score 118 goals in 292 appearances for United - with 103 of those in the Premier League.
He won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and a Ballon d'Or before a world-record £80m move to Real Madrid.
The next most prolific player to make the move from Portugal to England was also a Sporting to United signing - Bruno Fernandes.
The now United captain has scored 62 goals in 195 Premier League appearances - with a total of 98 goals in 290 games for the club - following his January 2020 move for a fee of £47m, rising to £67.7m.
In between those two, Nani also made the Sporting to United move in 2007 and netted 25 times in England.
Looking at out-and-out strikers, Mexico forward Raul Jimenez has scored 59 Premier League goals for Wolves and Fulham.
He joined Wolves from Benfica for a then club-record £30m in 2019 after a successful loan spell.
But for every Ronaldo, there is a Mario Jardel. The Brazilian won the Golden Boot five times in Portugal and netted 179 goals in 176 games in the country's top flight.
""His goals-per-game ratio is second to none anywhere in the world. We have found a striker who is going to score goals for us on a regular basis,"" said Bolton manager Sam Allardyce when they signed him in August 2003.
Aged 29, he only made seven substitute appearances in the Premier League, with his only three goals for the club coming in the League Cup.
Allardyce would go on to call him the worst player he ever managed.
Jardel was the first Portuguese league top scorer to move to the Premier League - with Gyokeres the most recent - and there were three in between.
Benni McCarthy top scored with Porto in 2003-04 and two years later joined Blackburn Rovers.
In his first season with Rovers he scored 18 Premier League goals and was only two behind Golden Boot winner Didier Drogba.
He would score 37 league goals in 109 games for Blackburn - and none in 11 for West Ham.
Carlos Vinicius and Darwin Nunez are the other players to win recent Portuguese Golden Boots - both with Benfica - before less-than-prolific spells in England.
Vinicius joined Tottenham on loan in 2020 and then Fulham permanently in 2022 - and has scored a combined eight goals in 53 Premier League matches.
Nunez, meanwhile, has netted 25 goals in 95 league games for Liverpool since his £64m move three years ago.
Will Gyokeres flourish in a tougher league?
Take a glance at the list of leading goalscorers in Europe's top leagues in 2024-25 and the usual suspects are there.
Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe managed 31 in his debut season in La Liga, Mohamed Salah contributed 29 goals as Liverpool claimed the Premier League crown, while Robert Lewandowski finished on 27 during Barcelona's title-winning season - one more than England captain Harry Kane's tally for Bayern Munich.
Gyokeres, who is 6ft 2in, managed 39, though the Primeira Liga is not considered one of the top five leagues in Europe.
The question is whether he can be prolific in a stronger league. He has just turned 27 and is yet to play in Europe's top five divisions - hence Ferdinand's comments.
It is perhaps worth noting 35% of his goals in 2024-25 came from penalties, as he successfully converted all 19 of his spot-kicks.
There is little denying that Gyokeres is a goalscorer, but will he be such a success against elite-level defences?
""Obviously with Arsenal's front players there's going to be competition,"" says Hamberg.
""I think he's committed to let go again and obviously he understands that Arsenal will be another step up in the ladder.
""At the same time, in his last few seasons, especially in the Champions League, you can see he is probably more prepared than ever to take that challenge on.
""He improves every year and normally stays fit. He's just one of those players who is good around the box, a good finisher, but he's also quite strong in transition and in big spaces.
""So he's quite versatile in that sense and I think that's a really big thing in the Premier League.""
Gyokeres has previous in England
Gyokeres has already played for a Premier League club.
Having failed to make the grade, Brighton allowed him to join Coventry for a small fee in July 2021 after an unspectacular return of three goals in 19 Championship appearances during a loan spell with the Sky Blues.
Two years later, he went to Sporting for £20.5m after scoring 38 times in 91 league games for Coventry across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons.
While in Lisbon, Gyokeres has scaled new heights and also played on the international stage as part of an exciting attacking line-up for Sweden, alongside Newcastle's Alexander Isak and Tottenham's Dejan Kulusevski.
Gyokeres scored nine goals in six games for his country - including four in one match against Azerbaijan - in the 2024-25 Nations League.
But it is not just his goals that have earned him attention.
Gyokeres is known for his intelligent movement and intense work-rate, and his blend of physical strength, technical skill and tactical awareness have earned admiring glances from clubs.
He is a creator as well as a goalscorer, with a lot of his chance creation coming from his love of running with the ball.
""When we had him, we had Glenn Murray who had scored double figures the season before, and we signed Neal Maupay from Brentford,"" says Hamberg, who was Graham Potter's assistant at several clubs including Brighton.
""So then Viktor was like the third or fourth [choice]. He would still play games for us in the Carabao Cup.
""From our point of view we were happy with him to have a support role being young, and be ready to find an opportunity.
""But as a person, when he has his mind on something he usually goes all-in for that.
""And then he really pushed to get out on loan because he has just had a mindset of 'if he plays he's going to do well'.""
'He always had the idea to be a top player'
Gyokeres' former team-mates and coaches remember a young boy who cried when he lost. They talk about a ""stubborn kid"" who was ""wild, really aggressive"" and would occasionally come to blows with team-mates.
There are stories about Gyokeres' single-mindedness, focus and drive.
David Eklund, academy scout at his first senior club Brommapojkarna, tells BBC Sport: ""He was never a superstar like Dejan Kulusevski. But he scored goals. That's it.
""He had a strong mentality but he's a really nice guy. He always worked hard and had the idea of being a top player, training every day. He wanted to prove people wrong.""
Dennis Lawrence, who was part of Mark Robins' backroom staff at Coventry when Gyokeres was there, says: ""He's got that ability to focus on and achieve anything he wants.""
Hamberg, who was assistant manager when Gyokeres was at Brighton and remembers the young striker pushing for a loan move because he felt he was not getting enough minutes, adds: ""What I like with him is that he's quite stubborn.
""His mindset is really good. He doesn't just sit down and wait for something to happen. He really wants to grab it himself. He trains how he plays, he's just a hard-working person that is ready to put a shift in. When it goes bad he can always rely on his work ethic.""

Football transfer rumours: Chelsea and Manchester United battle for Kolo Muani?,Today’s rumours are the very modern man,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/28/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea-and-manchester-united-battle-for-randal-kolo-muani,"Mon, 28 Jul 2025 07:20:39",Will Unwin,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","It is very difficult to find a top quality No 9 in the game and with Paris Saint-Germain’s Randal Kolo Muani available, a fun three-way battle could be heading the way of rumourmongers. Juventus have already had a bid rejected, although they are expected to return with a second offer. While they are crunching the numbers, Manchester United and Chelsea may sneak in with a superior financial package and steal the France international from under the Old Lady’s nose.
João Felix is on his way out of Chelsea after making absolutely no impact at the club for a second time, leaving many to wonder why they bothered signing him in the first place. It looked as if he was heading back to his boyhood club Benfica but Al Nassr have stepped in with a €50m bid to lure the benchwarmer to Saudi Arabia, where he will join his international colleague Cristiano Ronaldo at the club.
Even though James Trafford is readying himself for a Manchester City medical, there is a rumour swirling that Pep Guardiola might even fancy a third new goalkeeper of the summer, with Marcus Bettinelli already in the building. The latest name to be linked with the Etihad Stadium is Gianluigi Donnarumma of Paris Saint-Germain. If City are in fact interested in the Italian, they might need to battle bitter rivals Manchester United for his services, as Ruben Amorim really needs a new face between the sticks.
It will cost someone absolutely nothing – bar wages, etc – to bring in Dominic Calvert-Lewin, which might explain why Aston Villa, Milan and Newcastle are all rather keen on snapping up the striker.
Xabi Alonso is looking to perform a clearout at Real Madrid. At most clubs, this means getting rid of some right carthorses but when it comes to the Spanish giants, the list would make most people weep. Rodrygo is top of the list, and the latest team interested in the Brazilian winger are Tottenham, having missed out on Morgan Gibbs-White. Arsenal and Liverpool might also be convinced to make an offer for him. If Rodrygo does not float your boat, Endrick, David Alaba, Dani Ceballos and Ferland Mendy are also set to be made available.
All the talk was of a West Ham move for Leicester’s Mads Hermansen but supposedly the East Midlands club want too much cash to part with the stopper. It leaves Graham Potter in a bit of a pickle but there is a plan B on the horizon, coming in the form of Sheffield United’s Michael Cooper, who proved his quality in the Championship last season and might be confident he can step up tothe Premier League.
One potential incoming at Bramall Lane is the Everton midfielder Tim Iroegbunam. Rubén Sellés is eager to add some extra quality in the middle of the park and the former Aston Villa man might be keen on playing more regularly.
And staying in the second tier, Stoke City could sensationally bring Steven Nzonzi back to the club for absolutely nothing after he left the Iranian club Sepahan. The former France international spent three years playing in the Potteries during a glorious Premier League era and, aged 36, wants to relive those days.

How to stop Viktor Gyökeres? ‘We’d have to foul him just to slow him down’,Opponents from the striker’s time in Portugal on how they attempted to contain Arsenal’s new signing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/28/arsenal-signing-viktor-gyokeres-football-premier-league,"Mon, 28 Jul 2025 07:00:45",Arsenal,['Arsenal'],"Stopping Viktor Gyökeres was arguably the greatest challenge in Portuguese football over the past two seasons. Every time the new Arsenal striker stepped on to the pitch, defenders, goalkeepers and managers braced for 90 relentless minutes. Across his two years at Sporting, he scored 68 goals in 66 league appearances – and added another 29 in other competitions. But what is it really like to face the Swedish forward? And how can Premier League teams hope to contain him?
For Kewin Silva, the name stirs up difficult memories. In April, the then Moreirense goalkeeper was forced to fish the ball out of his net three times during one of Gyökeres’s standout performances for Sporting. Earlier in the season, the modest northern club had stunned the Lisbon giants with a 2–1 home win. Gyökeres did score from the penalty spot that day, but Moreirense’s defence managed to keep him quiet otherwise. In the return fixture, however, with the title race intensifying, nothing could stop him.
“I don’t have the best of memories from him – he scored in most of the games,” the Brazilian goalkeeper says with a chuckle. “We were fully aware of his individual quality. Because of that, we knew we had to be extra cautious, especially in terms of cover when he managed to break free. We’d often have to foul him just to slow him down.”
Describing Gyökeres almost like a recurring nightmare, Kewin vividly recalls some moments that showcased the striker’s brilliance. “I remember in one match, he dribbled past my centre-back near the edge of the box and took a toe-poke shot,” he says. “It was really powerful, but I managed to save it. He’s that kind of complete player – able to finish from anywhere, read the game intelligently and give depth by holding up play.”
How to stop him: the tactical breakdown
Carlos Carvalhal, the former manager of Swansea City and Sheffield Wednesday, was at the helm of Braga last season. His team were one of the few to take points off Sporting in the run-in, earning a hard-fought draw in Lisbon. Gyökeres opened the scoring early, but was effectively shut down for the remainder of the match. So what can Premier League teams learn from that performance?
“He has a preferred movement – drifting from the centre out to the left wing,” Carvalhal says. “To neutralise that, we focused on maintaining balance on our right side – their left. Sporting would try to draw our right-back out of position to create space for Gyökeres. So we trained our right-back specifically to avoid being lured out. That way, Gyökeres always had to deal with him directly. As a result, we didn’t allow him many clear chances.”
That wasn’t the only key, but Carvalhal says it was the most critical tactical element. Corners and other set pieces can also be a particular challenge. Although Gyökeres scored only five goals with his head for Sporting, Carvalhal says: “He is a very strong player in the area whenever there is a cross. We played with a very finely tuned sectorial tactic, keeping the four defenders really close together so he didn’t have space. It turned out well.”
Carvalhal also highlights how Gyokeres has grown during his time at Sporting, developing into a more complete forward. “If Arsenal are leading, he’ll exploit the open spaces. If not … well, I believe he’s improved a lot in terms of link-up play. Arsenal don’t just play wide; they also construct through the middle. Right now, he’s much better suited to their style than when he first arrived in Portugal. Back then, he was all about pace and power. He’s since refined his game considerably.”
‘One player on him at all times’
Gyökeres built a reputation for tearing through defences. Rúben Fernandes, the former captain of Gil Vicente, was one of the players tasked with shadowing him. He remembers with pride the night his team kept a clean sheet against Sporting – one of the rare occasions that season. The match, played in December 2024 in Barcelos, ended 0-0.
“We trained the entire week to make sure Gyökeres didn’t have space and to prevent Sporting’s dangerous attacks,” he says. There were “two or three players” specially assigned to make sure the forward didn’t have his way. “He was one of the most dangerous players; it’s normal he has at least one player on top of him at all times,” he says.
After the match, the dressing room was filled with pride. The draw felt like a victory against the champions. “We felt like we’d completed our mission,” Fernandes says with a grin. “He was scoring in nearly every game. So for us to shut him down – that’s something all the players, especially the defence, could be proud of.”
Asked what advice he’d give to Premier League defenders, Fernandes acknowledges that things may be tougher for Gyökeres now. “Players in England are more physical and used to his power. What tips can I give them? Never leave him alone, always have players around him.”
The message from Portugal is clear: Gyökeres can be stopped – but never easily. Arsenal fans hope his best is ahead, as a more complete and dangerous version of the player who barely got a look in during his time at Brighton from 2018-21 and has played in the Championship with Swansea and Coventry steps on to the Premier League stage. For defenders across England, his arrival should be a warning sign.

Liverpool agree £65.5m sale of winger Luis Díaz to Bayern Munich,Colombian keen on move before flying out for medical,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/27/liverpool-luis-diaz-move-bayern-munich,"Sun, 27 Jul 2025 13:54:34",John Brewin,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have agreed to sell Luis Díaz to Bayern Munich in a deal worth up to €75m (£65.5m). The Colombian, 28, is poised to fly from Liverpool’s training camp in Tokyo, having been given permission to travel for a medical with the German champions.
Bayern had made Díaz a long-term target and were forced to pay what the English champions demanded as fair market value. Díaz was keen for the move, having first indicated in the summer of 2024 he was open to a transfer. Liverpool reluctantly decided to sell the popular player as part of a summer reboot of their forward line, having twice offered a new contract to a player who arrived from Porto in January 2022.
Díaz was left out of Liverpool’s pre-season 4-2 defeat in Hong Kong against Milan, with Arne Slot confirming the absence was because of a possible transfer. “In Lucho’s situation it was, yeah,” the Liverpool manager said. “There are a lot of rumours around it lately and I cannot go into that. But he is training really well with us and we have decided, for now, not to play him yet.”
Liverpool paid Porto €45m plus add‑ons for Díaz, with only €4m triggered, bringing his total cost to €49m. Diaz is expected to depart the Liverpool camp within the next 24 hours as Slot prepares his squad for a meeting with Yokohama F Marinos on Wednesday.
Liverpool are seeking to bring in funds, having this summer signed Florian Wirtz, a long-term Bayern target, and Hugo Ekitike in two of the biggest deals in club history, and it is understood they are exploring other deals. There are continued links made to Newcastle’s Alexander Isak, who is open to a move from Tyneside. Darwin Núñez, also linked with a transfer, also did not play against Milan game, though Slot said the Uruguayan forward was absent on fitness grounds.
The completion of the Díaz deal will mean approaching £190m will have been made in player sales since Richard Hughes became sporting director in June 2024.
In Hong Kong, Slot affirmed he was happy with his centre-backs, despite the sale of Jarell Quansah indicating a vacancy. The Crystal Palace captain, Marc Guéhi, is the name leading the speculation on that front.
Slot said: “I don’t think we have a concern at centre-back. In terms of depth? I think Ryan [Gravenberch] showed today, by the way, that he can play in that position. He did it last season as well. Although we all know we favour him as a No 6. Wata [Endo] can play there. Joe Gomez only has a minor injury.”
The new arrivals Jeremie Frimpong, left-back Milos Kerkez and goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili all played in the second half of the friendly on Saturday, with Wirtz making his first start.
Meanwhile, João Félix is departing Chelsea for Saudi Arabia’s Al-Nassr for a deal that may eventually reach around £44m, with an initial £26.2m upfront. Felix joined Chelsea for a similar sum in August 2024 from Atlético Madrid, having previously been a Stamford Bridge loanee in the second half of 2022-23. In January, he headed to Milan on loan after just three Premier League starts after that return.
The Portuguese forward, 25, who cost Atlético €127m back in 2019, has had an undistinguished spell in English football over those two spells, scoring five goals in 28 appearances, a spectator as Chelsea won the Conference League and the Club World Cup this summer. Chelsea’s signings of Liam Delap, João Pedro and Jamie Gittens have further closed down his chances of making Enzo Maresca’s side. At Al-Nassr, he will partner compatriot, Cristiano Ronaldo, with whom he shares an agent, Jorge Mendes.
The Everton manager, David Moyes, has confirmed a bid for Bayern Munich left-back, Adam Aznou, and said his team need a significant number of signings for the club’s first season in a new stadium.
“We have made an offer, whether it’s accepted, or whether it’s all done,” said Moyes of Aznou, a 19-year-old former Barcelona trainee. “He’s a young player, he’s a young left-back.”
Moyes, speaking after his team lost 3-0 to Bournemouth in a pre-season friendly: “If I’m honest, we’ve actually tried to target the more senior players if we can, players who are maybe over the age of 25 with Premier League experience.”
In a Friday appearance on the Men In Blazers show, Moyes had said his squad required “nine or ten” and at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium clarified those words: “We’ve signed three so if you take them off, we’re probably in need of another five or six players possibly. That’s what we have to try and do.”
