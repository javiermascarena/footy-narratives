Amorim defends Bayindir as Neville calls for Man Utd to get a new goalkeeper,<em>Sky Sports'</em> Gary Neville says Manchester United 'unequivocally' need a new goalkeeper despite Ruben Amorim's defence of No 2 Altay Bayindir after his error led to Arsenal's 1-0 win on Super Sunday.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13413820/gary-neville-says-man-utd-need-a-goalkeeper-but-would-emi-martinez-or-gianluigi-donnarumma-fit,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 20:25:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Sky Sports' Gary Neville says Manchester United 'unequivocally' need a new goalkeeper despite Ruben Amorim's defence of No 2 Altay Bayindir after his error led to Arsenal's 1-0 win on Super Sunday.
The stopper replaced formerly regular first choice Andre Onana - who was not in the match squad - but failed to stop a Declan Rice cross that was then nodded home by Riccardo Calafiori.
Despite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.
The game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.
On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: ""There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.
""They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.
""In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.
""I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.
""The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.
""The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.
""You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.
""They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.
""There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.
""However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.
""When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.
""You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.""
Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.
He told Sky Sports: ""We have players to win any Premier League game.
""We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.""
Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: ""[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.
""For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.
""It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.
""We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.""
Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.
""He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,"" Amorim said.
""Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…
""I am happy with the three goalkeepers.""
Meanwhile, Sky Sports pundits Roy Keane and Micah Richards rowed over Bayindir's culpability for Arsenal's winner.
Former United midfielder Keane had no sympathy for the Turk, who appealed for a foul, with the Sky Sports pundit saying: ""He has to come with violence, he's got to be aggressive, he's got to be almost saying to players, 'Come in here, I'm happy to deal with it'.
""But he's not strong enough. It's like schoolboy stuff. Don't look at the referee, take control of it.""
Fellow pundit Richards, though, argued Bayindir should have been better protected by his defence, saying: ""If you look at the balance between Saliba and (Mason) Mount, he's getting ragdolled everywhere.
""I just thought (Matthijs) De Ligt could have come inside and Mount could have gone outside. I agree with Roy, Bayindir should have done a lot better, but when you've got bodies in front of you…""
That prompted Keane to interject, with the pair raising their voices to the apparent amusement of fellow pundit Daniel Sturridge.
""The goalkeeper's on his heels, he should be on his toes. Saliba's doing very little to him,"" retorted Keane.
""The job of that player in that role is to protect the goalkeeper so he can come and punch it,"" hit back Richards. ""There's a lot of chaos going on.""
Keane had the final word, adding: ""This is big boy stuff. You can't babysit a goalkeeper. He should go and play chess.""

Hits and misses: Cunha and Mbeumo give Man Utd hope in defeat,,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13413419/matheus-cunha-and-bryan-mbeumo-give-man-utd-hope-even-in-defeat-to-arsenal-premier-league-hits-and-misses,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 11:52:00",,['Manchester United'],"
Another Old Trafford defeat. But this wasn't same old Manchester United.
There were shoots of hope in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal.
They played with sharp bursts of electricity and actually hurt the Gunners from different angles with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo maintaining their Premier League form of last season.
Finally Ruben Amorim has players in central areas in attack that can cause chaos with their direct running and power.
Cunha ranked top for dribbles (6) and duels (20) whilst everything Mbeumo did was very positive despite being tightly marked for most of the encounter.
If they play like that at Old Trafford this season consistently, it could become a tough place for away teams to play. An expected goals tally of 1.59 suggests they were good for at least a goal. No points but a promising start.
Something to build on.Lewis Jones
Nottingham Forest made a bit of a mockery of Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-match concerns during a fruitful season opener.
Nuno had referenced a 'lack of options' in his squad midweek, something he doubled down on after an emphatic 3-1 victory. ""The club knows the needs of the squad so we have to be patient and see. The faster they come, the better,"" he said.
Perhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.
New signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.
Still, Morgan Gibbs-White oozed style. Elliot Anderson ran midfield and produced an early contender for assist of the season. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last year, scoring twice. Callum Hudson-Odoi was a handful too.
Nuno should count himself lucky. This is an exciting squad with exceptional talent. What more could he want?Laura Hunter
When Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.
Cut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.
Chelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.
Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.
Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.
Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.
They will need to recover and get back up to speed quickly, as they visit West Ham on Friday, live on Sky Sports, and the Hammers will be desperate to bounce back after a tough start to the season themselves.Callum Bishop
A goal from a set-piece and plenty of defensive resilience. Arsenal's hallmarks were on display as they edged to victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.
Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.
His best moment came in the first half, when he got his fingertips to an angled effort from Matheus Cunha. Even he wasn't sure how he pulled it off. ""I don't know how I saved it to be honest, it was very close to my feet,"" he told Sky Sports afterwards.
Gary Neville was similarly impressed. ""That is one hell of a save,"" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.
It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.
There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright
If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.
""I expect him being back and playing for us against Fredrikstad,"" was Oliver Glasner's response when asked by Sky Sports about the 27-year-old's future. But if it does turn out that was the last time Eze is seen in Palace colours, it was another reminder of just how influential he is.
Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.
However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop
Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.
No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.
Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on ""players taking responsibility"", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.
If the Brentford hierarchy do sell Wissa, having already let Bryan Mbeumo leave in this window, they will need to reinvest - and fast.Laura Hunter

'We weren't boring!' Amorim pleased - but Keane questions Man Utd expectations,"Ruben Amorim has praised his Manchester United side for not being ""boring"" during the 1-0 loss to Arsenal but Roy Keane has criticised the low expectations at the club following the defeat.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13413837/man-utd-0-1-arsenal-ruben-amorim-praises-his-side-for-not-being-boring-in-defeat-as-roy-keane-criticises-low-expectations-at-old-trafford,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 20:20:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Ruben Amorim has praised his Manchester United side for not being ""boring"" during the 1-0 loss to Arsenal but Roy Keane has criticised the low expectations at the club following the defeat.
United's new-look attack - consisting of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - impressed throughout the fixture as Amorim's side played with a fresh impetus going forward.
The hosts unleashed a total of 22 shots towards the Arsenal goal, with nine of these coming from Mbeumo and Cunha, as well as two from fellow new arrival Benjamin Sesko off the bench.
Despite their promise and threat, David Raya's seven saves at Old Trafford ensured Mikel Arteta's side walked away with a clean sheet and all three points on the afternoon after Altay Bayindir's error gifted Riccardo Calafiori the only goal in the game.
​​​​​​​In the aftermath of the defeat, Amorim chose to focus on the positives from the performance, where he applauded their improved bravery and aggression in comparison to last season.
""The most important thing - we weren't boring. I'm really proud of the guys. They were really brave in everything they did during the game,"" he told Sky Sports.
""Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home.
""We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.
""We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.
""With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.
""We need to win games but that was a completely different game to last season.""
United will look to convert another positive performance into points in their next fixture when they face Fulham, live on Super Sunday, on August 24.
Sky Sports' Roy Keane took an opposing view to Amorim's assessment of the performance, after arguing there is still cause for concern at the club despite the encouraging showing from the new recruits.
""The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary [Neville] said on commentary, everyone is OK with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better,"" Keane said on Super Sunday.
""It does worry me. Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power.
""Things will improve, it's tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There's still problems there with Man Utd.""
Fellow United legend and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville was more upbeat after the defeat, as he focused on the positive performances from Cunha and Mbeumo, as well as other positives that emerged from the loss.
Speaking after the game, he said: ""I thought they [United] played well, they were the better team in terms of performance.
""We know that performance isn't enough sometimes. Arsenal have got real resilience and can grind out 1-0 victories.
""There were some positives. Mbeumo in the first half and Cunha in the second half. They showed they can handle a big game at Old Trafford, they showed they have got the quality and ability. We obviously know that from Wolves.
""This is a tough start. Arsenal are a tough team to break down. I'm not too downhearted. I thought the system worked better and the back three did better.
""Casemiro and Fernandes did well in midfield; they held their own. Throughout the match, Man United were the better team, but they have lost the game.""

Arsenal show set-piece threat and resilience but what more do they need?,"Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford.

An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.
Mikel Arteta called it a ""massive"" result afterwards. ""To go in the first fixture at Old Trafford with that atmosphere, the way they are building momentum, with new signings and excitement around them, it's a great feeling,"" he added to Sky Sports.
They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. ""We don't want to be predictable,"" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.
No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.
They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.
Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.
They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.
""Arsenal are one of the best teams at managing games and knowing how to run the clock down,"" said Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville on co-commentary. ""They are an experienced unit.""
Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.
""They really dug in,"" added Neville. ""They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.
""They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.""
The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as ""phenomenal"" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was ""not at their standards"". In truth it was not even close. ""We need to improve a lot of things,"" he added.
The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.
The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.
Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.
Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.
Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.
Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.
Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.
""The sign of a really good team is when you're not at your best and you win football matches,"" said Sky Sports' Roy Keane. ""The worry for me in the second half is there were opportunities to really go at Manchester United, but they seemed off it from that point of view.
""Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.
""That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.""
What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.

Why was Eze's free-kick against Chelsea disallowed?,"Eberechi Eze thought he had fired Crystal Palace into the lead at Chelsea on Sunday with a stunning free-kick, but an unusual law was applied to disallow the goal.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13413718/eberechi-eze-disallowed-goal-why-crystal-palace-forwards-free-kick-was-ruled-out-vs-chelsea-after-var-check,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:24:00",,['Chelsea'],"Eberechi Eze thought he had fired Crystal Palace into the lead at Chelsea on Sunday with a stunning free-kick, but an unusual law was applied to disallow the goal.
The goal would have given the visitors a priceless victory on the opening weekend at Stamford Bridge.
Sky Sports explains why it was ruled out...
Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella committed a foul on Will Hughes just outside of the area and Eze blasted the free-kick past goalkeeper Robert Sanchez to put Crystal Palace ahead in the 13th minute.
However, the VAR James Bell spotted that Palace captain Marc Guehi had pushed Moises Caicedo to create a gap for the ball to fly through and, in doing so, had moved too close to the Chelsea wall when the ball was struck.
Referee Darren England ruled out the goal after consulting the pitchside monitor and announced the decision to Stamford Bridge. He said: ""After review, the Crystal Palace No 6 [Guehi] is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free-kick and a disallowed goal.""
Sky Sports' Chris Sutton said on co-commentary that the decision was ""scandalous"" and ""extremely harsh"".
The IFAB Laws of the Game for 2025/26 state: ""Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.""If, when a free-kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a 'wall' formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free-kick is awarded.""
One similar incident occurred last season, although it went unpunished, which coincidentally was also in Chelsea's favour.
Reece James scored a free-kick to equalise in the 95th minute against Bournemouth in January.
However, two Chelsea players, Marc Cucurella and Tosin, were stood within a metre of the Bournemouth wall. The goal should have been ruled out.
Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner says the Premier League has to be careful with the law.
""I know we have to be one yard away from the wall,"" he said. ""I think maybe we have a situation where we sometimes try to block like everybody's doing. And, obviously, the block started too early.
""But the Premier League has to be careful when they disallow these kind of goals. Because I think in every direct free-kick, there are blocks somewhere around the wall. But, of course, we have to accept it because that's the rule.
""I was a little bit surprised, because VAR is treated or handled very, very cautiously here in England, which I really appreciate. It's always about supporting the referee's own field decision.
""My great team, who is always watching all the set-plays, will watch it again and find a solution so that in the next case it won't happen again that the goal is disallowed, and then we can celebrate and hopefully win.""
Micah Richards said: ""There can't be any complaints but it feels like VAR is anti-goals.""
Roy Keane added: ""Attacking teams now need to be aware of this rule. We see players in there blocking and being a nuisance all the time.
""Guehi's almost gone too far in being a nuisance and shoving players about. He just needed to do it a little bit.""

Tottenham are in discussions with Palace over a deal for Eze as they look to add a new No 10 before the transfer deadline on September 1, and there had initially been doubts over whether he would feature at Stamford Bridge.
But Eze was named in Palace's starting line-up against Chelsea on the opening weekend of the Premier League and had a goal ruled out by an unusual law following a VAR check in the 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge.
""Don't always believe what you read, especially on the internet,"" said Glasner afterwards over the reports Eze wouldn't be involved. ""And here it's the same, who tells you? Who knows that this is the truth, what is written? There are rumours and so many rumours, and everybody tells somebody something for their own advantage, maybe.
""I watch the players every single day in the training sessions. If most of the things that are written about them is true, they couldn't perform like this, the team couldn't be together like this, the team couldn't be committed to each other like they are. It's just not possible.
""He was picked because he's a Crystal Palace player and he's a very good Crystal Palace player. He trained the whole week, so there was no reason not to pick him.""
Glasner then revealed Eze's £68m release clause has now expired. He said: ""I'm quite calm, but I also know, we have two weeks to go, and I know Ebs' clause is gone, so it's the club's decision, and we will see what happens.""
Eze has been one of Spurs' top targets this summer. A bid has not yet been made and Palace value him at £70m, with two years left on his contract.
Palace host Fredrikstad on Thursday in the first leg of their UEFA Conference League qualifying play-off and Glasner expects Eze to be involved again.
He said: ""He will come in tomorrow [Monday] to Crystal Palace's training ground, and have recovery. We will ensure a Tuesday off and we will meet Wednesday, and I expect him being back and playing for us against Fredrikstad.""
Sky Sports' Chris Sutton, speaking at Stamford Bridge, contrasted Eze's situation with that of Alexander Isak at Newcastle - where he has not featured for the club, or trained alongside his team-mates, since he announced his desire to leave earlier this summer.
""He seems like a good type,"" he said. ""If the situation with Tottenham happens, it'll happen. We've seen the situation at Newcastle with how Alexander Isak has downed tools and isn't the most popular person among the Newcastle faithful.
""If you're Oliver Glasner, you want your best players starting. Eze's one of those and Palace's season last season was phenomenal, the best in their history.
""They'll want to come to Stamford Bridge and get a result, and they stand a better chance of doing that with Eze starting.""

Why Sol Campbell didn't talk to me for six months - the Wayne Rooney Show,Wayne Rooney says his ex-England team-mate Sol Campbell went six months without talking to him after a penalty incident between them in Manchester United's 2-0 win against Arsenal in 2004.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c890qex1d5yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 05:30:45",Adwaidh Rajan,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Wayne Rooney says his former England team-mate Sol Campbell went six months without speaking to him after a penalty incident between the pair in Manchester United's 2-0 win against Arsenal during the 2004-05 season.
Arsenal, coached by Arsene Wenger, had been Premier League Invincibles the previous season, but Sir Alex Ferguson's United snapped their 49-game unbeaten league streak in an ill-tempered victory at Old Trafford.
Ruud van Nistelrooy gave the home side the lead from the penalty spot, after Rooney went down inside the box under the challenge of Arsenal centre-back Campbell.
Rooney, who had joined United from Everton earlier that summer, then sealed the victory in the 93rd minute - on his 19th birthday.
After the game, a slice of pizza was thrown at Ferguson by then 17-year-old Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas - a chaotic moment that would go on to be dubbed as the 'Pizzagate'.
""It was a big game for Arsenal. If they had won it, it was 50 games unbeaten for them,"" said Rooney, speaking on his new BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show.
""We beat them 2-0 and Campbell did not speak to me for over six months.
""We met up [during international duty] and Sol won't speak to me. Sometimes, I was with Sol and I'd say to him: 'Come on man, we are playing for England here'.
""But he wouldn't speak to me because he felt I dived. He left his leg out and I think there was a small contact.""
Matches between Arsenal and Manchester United contained seven red cards between February 1997 and February 2005 as the two sides battled regularly for major honours.
In 2003-04, Van Nistelrooy was accused by the Arsenal players of overreacting and getting Gunners skipper Patrick Vieira dismissed for a second yellow.
When the Dutch striker then went on to miss an injury-time penalty in the game that was billed 'Battle of Old Trafford', it sparked unsavoury reactions from his opponents - in particular Martin Keown.
The following season Roy Keane and Vieira clashed in the tunnel at Arsenal's former stadium Highbury, with referee Graham Poll having to separate the captains.
Reviewing Arsenal's 1-0 win at Old Trafford in their Premier League opener on Sunday, Rooney said: ""When I joined United, it was the big rivalry we had. I used to love playing against them, but it has died down a little bit now.
""I remember my first game at Highbury for United was the one with Roy and Vieira in the tunnel. You can feel the game was on a knife-edge and even the referees got it.
""We had the Fabregas one with Ferguson in the tunnel - with him throwing a pizza at [Ferguson]. There were fights in the tunnel where everyone was involved.""

'Big win' for 'resilient' Arsenal but work to do for new-look Gunners,Arsenal win away at Manchester United despite not being near their best - a sign of champions or cause for concern?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce3je9n7zvdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 19:33:42",Alex Howell,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Arsenal have started their season with three points and a win at Old Trafford, but their performance has led to a discussion about what their season could hold.
Mikel Arteta accepted his side were not at their best and it is only the first game of the campaign, with new players settling in - but the ability to get a result even when not playing well could be a big thing for the Gunners as they look to win a trophy this season.
Manchester United pinned Arsenal back for large parts of the match, had 61% possession and 22 shots as they looked to get back level - but the visitors managed to keep them at bay.
Arsenal looked uncharacteristically open at times in the first half, with Arteta extremely animated in his technical area.
What did Arteta try?
Arsenal have come into this season with a new, more direct, style of play as they look to get the best out of £64m striker Viktor Gyokeres.
However, Gyokeres looked like he was lacking in match fitness and despite Arteta saying that the forward ""did a lot of things very good"" he added that he and his staff have to ""work on"" Gyokeres' pressing.
Arteta also said his side did not make enough of the chance to play the ball behind the United defence, something that would have shown Gyokeres' qualities, and they missed ""seven or eight situations when the ball is completely open to play through"" to attack the goal.
Gyokeres failed to have a single shot in a league game for the first time since April 2023, when he played for Coventry City against Blackburn Rovers in the Championship, ending a 69-match run.
Former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: ""I felt for him a bit. His stats weren't good but he is relying on other players.
""Arsenal have brilliant creative players but they weren't quite at the races. Let him settle in, any player needs to build up relationships with other players.""
Ex-England striker Daniel Sturridge added on Sky Sports: ""Arsenal have been playing with a striker in Kai Havertz that is very different to Gyokeres, so it does take time to get used to the new player's runs.""
""He is also going to have to alter his game, it's not just about the team changing for him but him changing for the team. That's what it takes to hit the ground running.""
Match-winner Riccardo Calafiori was selected at left-back for his unpredictability in attack but his forward runs left Bryan Mbeumo free, and that allowed the United attack to cause problems.
There was also a first start for Martin Zubimendi in midfield, and he lined up alongside Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice, but the trio look as though they need more time to click.
Set-piece importance
Arsenal have become renowned for their threat from dead-ball situations and excelled at them since set-piece coach Nicolas Jover joined in 2021.
Calafiori's goal was their 31st goal from corners since the start of 2023-24, with Liverpool the next highest scorers in that time with 20.
The goal came from a new routine that they tried during pre-season, with five players lined up along the edge of the penalty area before the ball was swung in.
The Gunners attack did not click during the match and Arteta will be glad that their set-piece prowess got them an important opening-day three points.
Can they win title?
The Arsenal players celebrated in front of their fans after the full-time whistle and Arteta was asked by BBC Sport in his press conference whether he can take a positive in the manner they won the game.
""That gives you certainly momentum and confidence. Two very important things,"" Arteta said.
""We can still come away and find a way to win the game. The team has to find that resilience throughout the season for 10 months, in different contexts, to be able to do that.
""Of course we have to improve a lot of things, and that will happen very soon, but in terms of managing to get that into a very positive result that is a great way to do it.""
Former Crystal Palace and Republic of Ireland striker Clinton Morrison, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, thinks the qualities Arsenal showed could be a sign of a season of success.
He said: ""That's the sign of champions when you don't play well and still get the three points.
""The difference was goalkeepers. David Raya was outstanding, and Altay Bayindir made a huge mistake.
""Viktor Gyokeres fed on scraps. It is difficult for him. There's still a lot more to come from him.""
Former Manchester United player and Sky pundit Gary Neville said ""Arsenal had to change"" because of the way they played in the first half.
He added: ""The front three, especially the wide players, were not playing anywhere near good enough in this game.""
""Arsenal really dug in and showed a lot of resilience. Arsenal were never at their best but to come here to Old Trafford, or over to Manchester City, and get three points is big.""

How 'desperately unlucky' Man Utd showed signs of progress,"MOTD pundit Danny Murphy explains how Man Utd's new signings showed the difference they will make to Ruben Amorim's side, despite a 1-0 defeat by Arsenal.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y0vpd756lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 22:37:53",,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Sometimes as a pundit you can still be really positive about a team's performance even when they lose, and Manchester United's 1-0 defeat by Arsenal is a good example of that.
After conceding a silly early goal that ultimately proved decisive, United showed on Sunday that their system works and also demonstrated the difference their new signings will make to it.
As I said on Match of the Day, they were more dynamic and more direct. Physically, they looked really strong too.
Essentially, they were able to be much braver when they tried to win the ball back because they have got much more quality higher up the pitch.
Yes, they still lost and did not score, but United were the better team at Old Trafford and will feel desperately unlucky they did not get anything out of the game.
The same shape, so what was different?
We know United boss Ruben Amorim is not going to deviate from his 3-4-2-1 formation, and they were in the same shape again here.
What was different about United this time was they were much more positive in the way they were set up, whether they were in or out of possession.
For a start, their wing-backs Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu were really high up the pitch, and Amad Diallo was even more attack-minded when he replaced Dalot early in the second half.
Amorim took a risk by pressing a team as good as Arsenal like that, and in the first half they got caught on the break a few times, when the Gunners beat their press and had overloads that they did not make the most of.
But United were at home, so they should be on the front foot and what I really liked about them was how they took the game to Arsenal, in a way they rarely did against the top teams last season - even when they won.
Yes, United occasionally looked a bit ragged but, overall, the balance of the team was right and their energy was extremely high.
If they are to progress, they have to play with this kind of positivity all the time, and trust that their front players will eventually turn the great positions they find themselves in into goals.
Arsenal were not allowed to take control
United's new signings who started the game played a huge part in their improved performance.
I know it is only one game, but Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo looked like the players United hope they will be.
I am a big fan of what Mikel Arteta has done at Arsenal and for many seasons now one of their strengths has been that, in most of the games they play, they control possession and dictate the tempo to the opposition.
They did not have that control at Old Trafford, however, because of United's energy, bravery and willingness to try to go after them. All of that helped Amorim's side defensively too.
Lots of times last season when United tried to play out from the back, they were constantly caught in possession. We hardly saw that happen on Sunday.
With Cunha and Mbeumo, there was a more physical presence at the top of the pitch, with lots of pace and runners who wanted to get behind Arsenal's defence.
Last season, United's front line was pretty non-existent. Teams were not scared of them so they would just run all over them.
They now have quality players in attack who are full of confidence, who can frighten opposition defenders. That gives them respect straight away.
You could see that against the Gunners. With United looking to get the ball forward quickly, Arsenal's defenders were worried about Cunha and Mbeumo so they sat in rather than trying to get forward to kill the game off.
The United wing-backs were always willing to get forward in support too, knowing Cunha and Mbeumo were going to keep the ball. Mason Mount had an excellent game too, which was another big positive.
As it went on, you felt more and more like a United equaliser was coming.
Despite having 22 shots, it did not quite happen for them, but it still felt like their attack is more dangerous - and when Benjamin Sesko is fully fit he will add even more firepower.
Not perfect, but plenty of signs of progress
Of course there are still some question marks over United - they clearly were not perfect because they lost.
They may need a new central midfielder to replace Manuel Ugarte or Casemiro, because I know not everyone thinks they are the ideal fit alongside Bruno Fernandes, who might need someone more powerful to do a bit more running for him.
There are doubts over their goalkeeper situation too, which cost them again here with Altay Bayindir's mistake for Riccardo Calafiori's winner.
It is frustrating to lose to a goal like that anyway, but especially because it is something that has happened to them before.
However, while there was disappointment on the day, this was still a game that gives United plenty to build on.
Of course you always want results, but you also want to see some progress - especially at this extremely early stage of the season - and United's display showed plenty of that.
Right now progress means the team getting better and more used to the manager's system, with the players becoming comfortable in their relationships on the pitch, and the new signings bedding in.
It is also about them putting their struggles of last season behind them, and playing with some confidence and belief.
All of that happened against Arsenal.
Although they lost, they played like they thought they could win, and every team who plays against them now is going to be wary.
Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

Chelsea's £250m attack misfires - but should they be worried?,"After a goalless draw against Crystal Palace in their Premier League opener, Chelsea's attacking display raises questions - but will they be concerned?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyjndrnyx2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:27:06",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea used six attackers signed for a combined £250m in their Premier League opener, but could not find a way to score against Crystal Palace.
Joao Pedro, signed from Brighton this summer for £55m, started up front. Winger Jamie Gittens, who joined from Borussia Dortmund for £52m last month, made his debut on one flank, with £45m man Pedro Neto on the other.
Cole Palmer, the £40m attacking midfielder, played in behind as a number 10 - but despite Chelsea's attacking riches it was Palace who dominated the early stages and almost opened the scoring.
Midfielder Eberechi Eze rifled home a 13th-minute free-kick, but the goal was subsequently ruled out by VAR because Palace captain Marc Guehi was less than one metre away from the hosts' defensive wall.
Chelsea responded in the second half by bringing on two more new attacking signings - £29m winger Estevao Willian, who joined from Palmeiras, and £30m former Ipswich striker Liam Delap.
They both missed big chances, as did fellow substitute Andrey Santos, as the Blues were held to a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge in a disappointing start to the new season.
While this was only one match, and no titles are decided on the opening weekend, there will be ongoing scrutiny around Chelsea if they fail to build on their Club World Cup victory in the summer.
Some have tipped the Blues to mount a title challenge, but they will need to improve both creativity and goal-scoring to challenge champions Liverpool and the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City over a 38-game season.
That said, Chelsea's internal target remains to qualify for next season's Champions League through a top-four finish.
What does the data say?
When they dig into the data after the match, Chelsea will see one worrying statistic: they had just three shots on target - one fewer than Palace managed over 90 minutes.
However, they will be more encouraged by the figure of 1.81 expected goals (xG), which was superior to Palace's 1.07, and was the Blues' highest xG figure without scoring in a league match in 2025.
It was the 2-0 defeat away at Ipswich in December last year when Chelsea last amassed such chances without scoring.
Figures show that 88% of teams with an xG of between 1.7 and 1.9 have scored at least once since the start of the 2022-23 Premier League season.
It serves to highlight both some bad luck and poor finishing, with Chelsea's best chance, according to Opta, being hit well over by midfielder Santos on his weaker left foot in the dying moments.
Should Chelsea be worried?
Chelsea are unlikely to be worried at this early stage.
But they will know that victory in the Club World Cup will not easily translate into the Premier League, particularly after a truncated 13-day pre-season having becoming world champions in July.
Manager Enzo Maresca was reluctant to blame a lack of pre-season for Sunday's display, saying: ""I don't think so, because until the end we competed. We try to win the game. I think we had some chances at the end with Estevao and Andrey Santos.
""So that showed that probably we competed quite good overall. For sure, they already played, I think, seven, eight games (in pre-season). And for us, last week we played two games, but we tried to share minutes.
""So the real game for us was today. But for sure, slowly, slowly we're going to be better.""
Joao Pedro, Gittens, Estevao and Delap are all new signings that may need time to bed into their new surroundings and build an understanding with their team-mates.
Former Brighton striker Joao Pedro looks the most ready to hit the ground running, with three goals in his three competitive starts for Chelsea having cut his holiday in Brazil short to take part in the Club World Cup.
That contrasts starkly with Palace, who selected 10 of the same 11 players who started the FA Cup final and Community Shield wins against Manchester and Liverpool, with only injured midfielder Daichi Kamada unavailable to play.
Maresca's biggest ongoing concern is the serious injury to defender Levi Colwill, which he feels disrupts their ability to play out from the back.
The Italian coach has asked the club to sign a new centre-back but they have told him to work with what he has got - and academy graduate Josh Acheampong earned praise from his manager after stepping into Colwill's place.
Maresca added: ""Today he did very well, he dealt with [Jean-Philippe] Mateta very well. So overall, he did a good game.""
Striker Nicolas Jackson was suspended after a red card against Newcastle late last season, but would not have been selected had he been available.
Chelsea remain open to selling Jackson and fellow attacker Christopher Nkunku and are also in the market to sign a forward, with both Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig's versatile attacker Xavi Simons targeted before the transfer window shuts on 1 September.

'They have a problem' - goalkeeping concerns remain at Man Utd,Manchester United's goalkeepers are under scrutiny after Altay Bayindir's error gifts Arsenal victory at Old Trafford.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyvmg0n2npo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 20:31:32",Simon Stone,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Ruben Amorim made a goalkeeping gamble on Sunday - and in the eyes of most it backfired spectacularly.
The Manchester United boss selected Altay Bayindir instead of the fit-again Andre Onana and it was the Turkey keeper's early error that proved the difference in Arsenal's 1-0 win at Old Trafford.
Onana's future at the club has been the subject of much debate this summer and, despite Amorim's fierce defence of his keepers, the number-one position at United is again the talking point.
A United official privately offered a basic truth about the club's rebuild much earlier in the summer though.
""If we buy forwards, people will ask why we didn't get midfielders, if we get midfielders, they will ask why we didn't get a goalkeeper. We can't do everything in one go,"" the official said.
As it turns out, United focused their £200m summer spend on forwards as they felt that area of the pitch was the one that required the most substantial improvement.
And their attack looked far more of a threat on Sunday than it did for much of last season - with Matheus Cunha's battling style endearing him to the crowd and Bryan Mbeumo exhibiting all the attributes that helped him score 20 league goals for Brentford in 2024-25.
While United could not find an equaliser, despite their attacking toil, Bayindir's error meant it was almost inevitable the focus after this opening day defeat would be the goalkeeper.
Bayindir failed to get a strong hand to Declan Rice's 13th-minute corner, only managing to palm the ball back towards to the goalline where Riccardo Calafiori nodded home.
Former Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Manchester United have a problem.
""There [are] rumours of [a move for] the Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez. Now [PSG's] Gianluigi Donnarumma has become available. If I'm United I am going to get a top-quality goalkeeper.
""Andre Onana has made some big mistakes last season. Goalkeepers are the last line of defence and they can't afford to make mistakes like that.""
'He's getting pushed' - Amorim defends Bayindir
Understandably, head coach Amorim was robust in his defence of Bayindir.
""In that moment, you either choose to push a player or to get the ball,"" said Amorim. ""[Bayindir] chooses to get the ball, but he's getting pushed.
""He cannot defend it himself. That is my feeling when I see the play.""
For a more detached expert view, it is worth noting the words of Joe Hart - who disagreed with Amorim's assessment.
Only Peter Shilton and Jordan Pickford have more than Hart's 75 England caps in goal.
""That's not a foul [on Bayindir],"" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Bayindir has got to scrap with his left arm to deal with [William] Saliba and jab the ball away with his right.
""I got ready to defend Altay Bayindir, then I saw the first replay and thought 'I can't defend him here'. He has got far too involved and got lost in the battle and made a bit of a mess.
""It's not down to being weak, it is about putting yourself in the best possible position to use what you have got.""
Hart feels United could have offered more protection to Bayindir by putting a defensive shield in front of him. It is the type of move Sir Alex Ferguson used to help David de Gea, who struggled in his early days at the club.
Going further back, Peter Schmeichel used to sort a six-yard box scrum out by shoving opponents out of the way and then yelling at the referee.
The game has changed substantially since then. The advent of VAR should mean if Saliba was committing a foul, as Amorim claimed, the goal would have been disallowed.
""If it's allowed, we need to do the same thing,"" said Amorim.
'I'm happy with the three goalkeepers'
Amorim later clarified that Onana had not been dropped for this game and was also not about to leave the club.
The United boss said the Cameroon keeper had not been considered because he had missed every pre-season match because of a hamstring injury he sustained at the beginning of last month.
United did have tentative discussions much earlier in the transfer window about signing World Cup-winning goalkeeper Martinez from Aston Villa.
That went nowhere. More recently, they have been quick to rule themselves out of a move for PSG's Champions League-winning goalkeeper Donnarumma.
In addition, United also decided to loan highly-rated 21-year-old Radek Vitek to Bristol City.
Internally, United have high hopes for the Czech Republic youth international, whose performance in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Charlton on Saturday was labelled ""world class"" by Addicks coach Curtis Fleming.
However, United clearly feel Vitek is not yet ready to deal with the pressure of being a regular at Old Trafford.
So, if Onana was not available, it left Amorim facing a straight choice between Bayindir and 37-year-old Tom Heaton, who signed a one-year contract extension this summer and says he still has a ""drive and desire to play"".
Amorim was displeased at being asked about his goalkeeper selection during his assessment of Sunday's loss.
He took particular exception to a suggestion that Bayindir's failure to keep out Son Heung-min's corner in an EFL Cup loss at Tottenham in December, when the keeper was also crowded out in his own six-yard box, was a reason why picking him was a risk.
""Why?"" he responded. ""[Son' goal was] without VAR. With VAR, it's a foul.
""And then what happened in the next game? Who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember?
""Bayindir was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one on another.""
There were actually four games, and almost a month, between the Tottenham defeat and the next time Bayindir played - in United's FA Cup penalty shoot-out victory at Arsenal.
Onana started all the matches in between.
Given Amorim's subsequent comments about his overall goalkeeping department, the chances are Onana will be back for next weekend's trip to Fulham.
""We proved today we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal,"" he said.
""We were the better team. I'm happy with the three goalkeepers.""

After the goalless draw against Chelsea, Glasner told Sky Sports: ""There are a lot of rumours about Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi, but they were 100% with this group... and they have proved that in a big way.""
On the future of Eze, Glasner added: ""He will come tomorrow to the Crystal Palace training ground, Tuesday off, we take Wednesday and I expect him to be back playing for us against Fredrikstad.""
Palace will face Norwegian side Fredrikstad in the Conference League play-off round on Thursday (20:00 BST kick-off).
The Eagles qualified for Europe for the first time in history by winning last season's FA Cup, but were demoted from the Europa League over Uefa's multi-club ownership rules.
If Eze or Guehi play in Palace's Conference League qualifier, they would still be able to feature for another team in the league phase of European competition this season according to Uefa's rules.
Glasner also spoke to BBC Match of the Day about the duo: ""Everyone could see the performances against Liverpool [in the Community Shield] and today they were 100% aligned with this team and Crystal Palace.
""As long as they are 100% committed, they will play as they are so good.""
On Saturday, BBC Sport reported that Tottenham were accelerating their move to sign 27-year-old Eze, having been in discussions over a transfer since the start of the week.
The England forward has an expired release clause in his contract which was worth an initial £60m, plus a further £8m in add-ons.
It is understood Tottenham are negotiating an offer slightly below the total release figure.
And it is a similar story with England centre-back Guehi, with talks ongoing between Palace and Premier League champions Liverpool.
Speaking last week, Eagles chairman Steve Parish said the club would sell their captain this summer to avoid losing him on a free at the end of his contract.
Palace are believed to want about £40m for the 25-year-old, but Liverpool want to pay less than that figure.

Why was Eze's free-kick disallowed against Chelsea?,Crystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze thought he had given his side the lead with a well struck free-kick within the opening 15 minutes at Stamford Bridge.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c9d0v5xq21yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 14:06:13",Ben Ramsdale,['Chelsea'],"Crystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze thought he had given his side the lead with a well-struck free-kick within the opening 15 minutes of their Premier League match away to Chelsea.
But it wasn't to be as VAR intervened and disallowed the goal, much to the surprise of many.
However, it was the correct decision - let the Ask Me Anything team explain why.
Simply, the goal was chalked off because a Palace player was standing too close to the Chelsea wall.
Referee Darren England made an announcement to the crowd to explain the decision.
He said: ""After review, away number six is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free-kick and a disallowed goal.""
The International Football Association Board's Law 13 states that when three or more defending team players form a wall, all attacking players must remain at least one metre from the wall until the ball is in play.
This rule was introduced to the laws of the game in 2019-20.
The explanation at the time was that ""attackers standing very close to, or in, the defensive 'wall' at a free-kick often cause management problems and waste time"".
It continued: ""There is no legitimate tactical justification for attackers to be in the 'wall' and their presence often damages the image of the game.""
And so Eze's goal was disallowed.

It has been a constant in the last two seasons: Manchester United are doing OK in a game, resembling something approaching a football team, then out of nowhere all their good work is ruined by goalkeeping incompetence somehow predictable and unpredictable. And that was exactly what happened against Arsenal, United starting fairly well, only to concede a corner and fall behind in inexcusably soft circumstances. Usually, André Onana is the man responsible, but in his absence, Altay Bayindir seized the mantle with alacrity. We can be absolutely certain that Ruben Amorim has already told his bosses he must have a new keeper and, though they have already spent heavily, the position must be addressed as a matter of urgency because if it is not, this will continue happening and they might soon be facing questions about whether a new manager is necessary. It is pointless building a swish new house only for the owners to knowingly leave the back door open, get burgled and sack the builder. Daniel Harris

Ndoye and Wood spark Forest fire
When Anthony Elanga departed for Newcastle, Forest knew they would face a difficult task replacing the speedy winger. Numerous potential targets were analysed and availability ascertained but they finally selected Dan Ndoye as the man to come in. The 24-year-old started on the right and caused problems for Rico Henry with his pace and trickery. Although Ndoye is not able to reach the same speeds as Elanga, no full-back will enjoy the prospect of facing the Swiss winger. Nuno Espírito Santo tested his speed by putting him through the middle at one point, getting him to turn the Brentford defence and offer a different proposition to Chris Wood. A superbly taken header showed that there is plenty more to Ndoye’s game than merely trying to reach the byline and send in a cross. In previous years, Brentford were seen as intelligent recruiters but they are being outshone by Forest. Will Unwin

A Bridge too far for VAR?
New seasons bring new directives. It is, of course, hard to fault the officials for implementing the laws of the game. Even so, nobody who actually enjoys football can have enjoyed seeing Eberechi Eze’s free-kick against Chelsea ruled out because of Marc Guéhi being penalised for straying within a metre of the Chelsea wall while he grappled with Moisés Caicedo. The intervention felt way too pedantic and petty from the VAR. There is talk of a light touch but this was surely too much interference. Eze’s free-kick was brutal and Guéhi’s positioning made no difference to whether Robert Sánchez was able to save it. Let’s see, too, if this law is applied throughout the season. This often happens at the start of a campaign – new tweaks to the laws are made and there is plenty of scrutiny on them early on, only for referees to stop being as stringent a few months in.

Baleba’s presence is priceless
Carlos Baleba, playing his first football for almost a month, showed why he is considered the next jewel off the Brighton production line. Still just 21, he was the player most in control amid an otherwise hurried, bitty midfield battle. Once he departed in the second half, Brighton lost control, and as late as Rodrigo Muniz’s goal came, it became ever more probable as time dragged on. The word from within Brighton is Baleba is resolutely not for sale, Fabian Hürzeler saying afterwards: “Together, we want to go with him and make with him the next step.” Brighton have each player’s pathway planned out, which invariably concludes with an eventual sale. Not just yet, though, at a club where patience is seen as a virtue. Three big summer signings, teenagers Stefanos Tzimas, Charalampos Kostoulas and Tommy Watson, were all made to wait for their Premier League debuts. All must trust a process that delivers dividends for individuals and the club alike. John Brewin

Walker faces up to fresh survival challenge
Almost 14 years after replacing him for his England debut against Spain in the days of Fabio Capello, Kyle Walker was handed his competitive Burnley debut by Scott Parker on Saturday. The 35-year-old couldn’t do much to prevent either of Richarlison’s goals as his former club Tottenham kicked off the Thomas Frank era in style but showed the kind of leadership that will be required if Burnley are to compete in the top flight. Walker is closing in on a century of England caps and has been selected in both of Thomas Tuchel’s squads so far. He will hope that a season that is expected to be spent fighting relegation will be enough to book a spot at next year’s World Cup. “At his age and the level where he’s come from and what he’s done, of course, this is a totally different project and something he’s not probably experienced this year, what he’s going to face,” admitted Parker of the six-time Premier League winner with Manchester City. “But I know Kyle well, and I know he’ll face up to that.” Ed Aarons

Trafford enjoys No 1 spot … for now
Manchester City scored with each of their four shots on target at Molineux but, while the roaming midfielders Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki took most of the acclaim, down the other end of the pitch James Trafford enjoyed a fine debut. It had been a long time in the making for the goalkeeper. This summer Trafford rejoined City two years after leaving for Burnley and 10 years after first joining City aged 12 from Carlisle. There are suggestions City will move for Gianluigi Donnarumma if Ederson departs for Galatasaray as mooted but Trafford, viewed as the long-term England No 1, has staked his claim, saving smartly from Jørgen Strand Larsen when required. “He’s tall, his presence is really good,” said Pep Guardiola. “The fans love having homegrown players from the academy playing for us.” Ben Fisher

Fans have to provide the entertainment
How sadly emblematic of the modern game that supporters save their most entertaining chants for criticising the financial state of the game. Aston Villa fans voiced their dissatisfaction at the governing bodies’ rules (“Premier League and Uefa, your rules are fucked” didn’t quite scan) that dictate they’re not allowed to overspend their income by more than £105m over a three-year period for Premier League regulations, or exceed Uefa’s remit to avoid paying wages at more than 70% of their revenue, which they have done every year since their 2019 promotion. How darned unfair of the authorities. Meanwhile, Newcastle fans applauded their willing workers during and at the end of their gutsy goalless draw at Villa Park before finally giving Alexander Isak both barrels by claiming there’s “only one greedy bastard” as their star striker continued to make himself unavailable to play as he attempts to dig his way out to Liverpool. Will they be having a word with Yoane Wissa, who has been linked with a move to Newcastle and did not play for Brentford on Sunday? If only we had an independent body to help regulate these matters … Peter Lansley

Pensioners and Potter in focus
Sunderland have more than 80 season ticket holders aged 85 and over. As a thank you for their support in recent, troubled, years the newly promoted club have given them all free seats for the entire campaign. It’s a wonderful gesture and, after Saturday’s 3-0 home win, all the evidence is that the recipients could be in for a treat. The only caveat is that Régis Le Bris’s skilfully blended team cannot play West Ham every week. With Habib Diarra and Granit Xhaka – two of eight home debutants – shining, goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor suggested a troubled season may await Graham Potter. “I understand the scoreline doesn’t look pretty for us,” said West Ham’s manager. “We have to accept the criticism and we have to do better. We can’t wait for the opposition to give us points.” Potter must hope the improvement begins at home to Chelsea on Friday night. With Lucas Paquetá disappointing in a visiting side for whom only Jarrod Bowen really impressed the portents are not promising. Louise Taylor

Gunners fail to impress at Old Trafford
A win over Manchester United is an excellent start to a season; in a similar vein, it is silly to draw lasting conclusions after one game and it is not cheating to score regularly from set pieces. Watching Arsenal at Old Trafford, though, there was little sense that anything has changed over the summer: they were still solid at the back, unimaginative in midfield and uninspired in attack. Viktor Gyökeres will surely score goals, but looked nevertheless like a blunt instrument, able to run channels and physically assert without suggesting he can create for himself or settle games with a moment of brilliance. Of course, it may well be that the goals he adds are enough – Arsenal have not been far away in any of the last three seasons. Yet throughout them all, there has been a sense that, good though they are, at least one other team will be better – and that still remains the case. Daniel Harris
Cherries picked off but ready to grow
The problem for clubs whose identity is based on buying low to sell high is that they have always to replenish – and any signing is always something of a risk. It felt Bournemouth’s final league position last season didn’t quite reflect how good they’d been, which in turn felt as though it might have been something of a missed opportunity, as four of their first-choice back five (if you include the goalkeeper) and Dango Ouattara all left. Perhaps they might have been slightly more solid had a couple more of those defenders remained but even though they let in four against Liverpool, there were enough positive signs to suggest that they’ll be at least mid-table this season. The press remained aggressive and focused enough to unsettle the champions, Evanilson was as big a handful as ever, Antoine Semenyo had an exceptional game and the new left-back Adrien Truffert showed enough to suggest he might be able to replicate the forward thrust of Milosz Kerkez.

Fifa consider holding Club World Cup every two years from 2029 – and could expand it,Real Madrid understood to be driving force,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/17/fifa-consider-holding-club-world-cup-every-two-years-from-2029-and-could-expand-it,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 20:00:39",Matt Hughes,"['Manchester United', 'Liverpool']","Fifa will consider holding the Club World Cup every two years from 2029 in a move that would put more pressure on the international calendar and trigger another backlash from the Premier League and Uefa.
The next Club World Cup is due to take place in four years’ time, following the first expanded 32-team tournament held in the US this summer, but the world governing body is under pressure from leading clubs to make it a biennial event. Real Madrid are understood to have raised the issue of moving to a two-year cycle during talks with Fifa in Miami in June, a proposal that has gained support from other clubs who failed to qualify for this year’s tournament, including Barcelona, Manchester United, Liverpool and Napoli.
Chelsea received £85m in prize money for winning the competition and other big European clubs want the opportunity to take advantage of Fifa’s huge revenue streams, which are being funded largely by Saudi Arabia’s Surj Sports Investments.
Liverpool in particular were unfortunate not to take part this year, as they met one of the qualifying criteria by being among the top eight ranked clubs in Europe, but missed out as Fifa opted to admit a maximum of two sides from a country. Chelsea and Manchester City took the English slots as recent Champions League winners. There is an exception to the limit if more than two clubs from a country win their continental competition during the qualifying period, as was the case with Brazil this year.
Fifa sources said that while there is no serious consideration being given to staging the Club World Cup in 2027, the situation is likely to change after 2029, with the prospect of another tournament being held in 2031 to be explored.
Fifa’s hands are tied in the short-term as the international match calendar is fixed until 2030, with only the 2029 Club World Cup in the schedule, as part of a memorandum of understanding signed between Fifa and the European Clubs Association two years ago.
With Fifa already facing legal action from World Leagues, an international lobby group that includes the Premier League, there is no appetite to inflame it further by ripping up the current schedule. World Leagues has filed a legal complaint to the European Commission with support from the global players’ union Fifpro, accusing Fifa of “abuse of dominance” for allegedly failing to consult them over the scheduling of the Club World Cup.
Staging the new competition every two years would increase tensions still further, but there is an acknowledgement on both sides that the entire global calendar after 2030 is open for negotiation.
As part of a quid pro quo for moving into the club game, sources have indicated that Fifa may be willing to remove the June international break to ease player workloads and create space for events such as the Club World Cup, although that would be opposed by Uefa, which uses summer dates to stage the finals of its Nations League competition.
In a pre-season address last week the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, outlined his concerns with expanding the Club World Cup, although the biggest top-flight clubs appear to disagree. “Fifa was put on earth really to regulate the global game and to run international football, and the Club World Cup is a move into club football,” Masters said. “The leagues and the players have not been consulted at all on the timing and scheduling of the competition, and I think whatever iteration of it may come next, we do need to be consulted on that.
“Obviously, it does have an impact on the scheduling of the Premier League season, that much is clear. We’re asking for a seat at the table, a proper discussion for the leagues.”
Fifa is the process of reviewing the qualifying criteria for the 2029 Club World Cup and may lift the cap of two clubs per country, and as previously reported by the Guardian it is consulting on whether to increase the number of teams involved from 32 to 48. The men’s World Cup next year and the 2031 Women’s World Cup will involve 48 teams for the first time, so expanding the Club World Cup would be consistent with Fifa’s tournament model.
Having awarded hosting rights to this year’s competition to the US without inviting tenders, Fifa is planning to run formal bidding process for future tournaments. Qatar, Spain and Morocco have all expressed interest in staging the 2029 Club World Cup, with details of the tender process expected later this year.

"New season, same strife between the sticks for Manchester United | Jonathan Wilson",Altay Bayindir’s susceptibility to an inswinging ball is equal to André Onana’s and Arsenal had just the man to exploit it,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/17/manchester-united-goalkeeping-arsenal-premier-league-new-season,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 18:21:11",Jonathan Wilson,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","New seasons are never new starts, not entirely. The sun may have been shining and the temperature in the mid‑20s. There may have been new kits on the pitch and new flags in the stands. There may have been an obsessive focus on the new signings. There may, among home fans, perhaps especially those refreshed in the new marquee behind the Stretford End, have been a giddy expectation that this season couldn’t be as bad as last for Manchester United. But the roots of a game run deep, stretching back into the mulch of the past. This was a game shaped by events last December.
Arsenal are good at set pieces; United are vulnerable to inswinging deliveries. In December last year Arsenal beat United 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium, both goals the result of corners. United had André Onana in goal for that one, but Tottenham had taken notice of the susceptibility to balls arced into the goalmouth, the way United struggled to protect their keeper.
Two weeks later, Spurs played United in the Carabao Cup. Altay Bayindir was in goal for that one and endured the indignity of being beaten direct from a corner by Son Heung-min.
United don’t like inswingers and Bayindir really doesn’t like inswingers. Declan Rice is good at taking inswingers. And so there was a certain inevitability to what happened after 13 minutes. United had looked vaguely threatening. Arsenal had been rattled enough to commit four fouls in that period. Then Arsenal won a corner from their left.
Rice whipped it in, Bayindir flapped and would have scored an own-goal had Riccardo Calafiori not nodded the ball over the line from the goal-line.
United, perhaps, could point to the way William Saliba, having grappled with Mason Mount, bumped into him just as the ball arrived, and perhaps, given the new directives to referees to crack down on holding, a foul could have been given. But then there were half a dozen incidents that could have been penalised one way or the other in the box from that one corner; any refereeing decision in such circumstances could not but feel arbitrary.
Fundamentally, with more decisive goalkeeping there wouldn’t have been an issue. David Raya’s assertive punch to clear an inswinging free-kick from Bruno Fernandes early in the second half, cuffing Matthijs de Ligt out of the way, showed the way to do it.
Maybe the analogy was never entirely apt. Maybe building from the foundations up doesn’t necessarily mean getting the defence right.
Maybe as football increasingly becomes about content production there is some sort of commercial logic in prioritising the goalscorers and the creators, the players who will look good clipped up or, to continue the metaphor, the spire, the ornamentation on the roof. But on the other hand, it doesn’t much matter if you’ve spent £200m on forwards if you’re going to concede goals like that. Particularly if you don’t then actually score yourself.
There were positive signs from both Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha but the most incisive United player, yet again, was Amad Diallo, who came off the bench to play at right wing-back 10 minutes into the second half. United, perhaps, would consider themselves unfortunate. Patrick Dorgu hit the post and Raya had to make seven saves, more than any other goalkeeper on the opening weekend. But only his reflex stop down to his left to keep out a Cunha effort from a narrow angle was a save that he would not necessarily be expected to make.
To point out that United drew this fixture last season and that they’re therefore doing worse this season is on one level meaningless.
But equally this is a manager whose win percentage is 37.2%, the worst in half a century – and if United fail to win at Fulham next week, he will drop below both Frank O’Farrell and Wilf McGuinness to have the worst win percentage of any United manager since Herbert Bamlett, who was sacked in 1931. Context matters.
There was plenty of mitigation on Sunday afternoon. The closer you zoom in the more excuses can be found: a goalkeeping error, new players settling in, a couple of close-run things. But it won’t take many more bad results for faith in Amorim to wane. When form has been so bad, it’s only natural to catastrophise: if they don’t win at Craven Cottage, the next home match, against newly-promoted Burnley, takes on a ghastly aspect: not merely a game they should win, but a game they have to win.
This season is not discrete from the last. New signings, a resetting of the table, new hope, cannot erase the footfalls that echo in the memory. Poor results are a problem not only in themselves but for the impact they have on games to come: time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future.

Eze has possible farewell goal ruled out as Crystal Palace hold Chelsea to draw,,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/17/chelsea-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 15:24:16",Jacob Steinberg,"['Chelsea', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Chelsea have a gold badge on the shirt for the next four years but they had lead in their boots for much of their opening game. This was a flat start to a possible title challenge from the new world champions, who were unable to lift themselves after being dragged back down to earth during this feisty London derby, and it could have been worse given that Crystal Palace’s diminishing faith in authority was not exactly helped by Eberechi Eze having the only goal of the game ruled out by a pedantic VAR intervention.
It would have been some way for Eze to sign off for Palace, assuming that his widely anticipated move to Tottenham goes through this week. The playmaker appeared to have given Oliver Glasner’s excellent side the lead when he blasted an early free-kick past Robert Sánchez, although Palace’s mistake was forgetting that nothing is ever truly certain in modern football. They have already had one prize snatched away this summer – Uefa demoting them to the Conference League over a failure to comply with multi-club ownership rules – and endured more frustration when Darren England, the on-pitch referee, was sent to the pitchside monitor and penalised Marc Guéhi for straying within a metre of the Chelsea wall as he grappled with Moisés Caicedo.
A correct application of the law? Probably, but it still felt like too much interference. Glasner was right to point out that such offences rarely draw censure. “Everyone in the stadium thought it was a goal,” the Palace defender Chris Richards said. “But you live and die by VAR and today we died from it.”
Yet Palace keep battling. They still risk losing Guéhi and Eze, whose participation in this game had been in doubt when talks over a move to Spurs progressed on Saturday, but nobody will relish playing them at the moment. There is some serious talent at Glasner’s disposal – Adam Wharton offered elegance in midfield, while Daniel Muñoz and Tyrick Mitchell negated Chelsea’s wingers – and after following up their victory against Manchester City in the FA Cup final last season by beating Liverpool in the Community Shield, this was further proof of their discipline, skill and tactical excellence.
It gave context to Chelsea’s stumble. They might be playing catchup already but it is too early to talk of dropped points. Palace will probably threaten to inconvenience Chelsea’s rivals further down the line.
Enzo Maresca was relaxed afterwards, saying he saw no signs of lethargy. Equally, though, concerns over whether Chelsea will pay a price in terms of physicality after earning all that prize money during their triumphant, extended summer have not disappeared .They had a crunched pre-season after going all the way in the Club World Cup and, for all the celebrations before kick‑off, it was fair to wonder if Chelsea would be ready to go only 35 days after taking Paris Saint-Germain apart in New Jersey.
Those misgivings about Chelsea’s rustiness became evident during an opening in which their passes went astray and their attackers struggled to find space. There was an early booking for Reece James, Caicedo was guilty of some uncharacteristic loose touches and Maresca will not take much pleasure from seeing his argument for his superiors to react to Levi Colwill’s long-term knee injury by signing a new centre-back grow stronger.
Colwill, so crucial to the team’s buildup play from the back, was missed. Tosin Adarabioyo’s absence with a minor issue was another complication, although Maresca was pleased with how Josh Acheampong performed as the central centre‑back in possession. There was one errant pass from the 19‑year‑old, sparking the sequence that led to Eze’s disallowed free‑kick, but he grew more assured as the game progressed.
Chelsea improved in the second half. Estêvão Willian offered excitement after replacing Jamie Gittens, who had a disappointing debut on the left flank, and almost snatched the winning goal. Andrey Santos, who replaced a tiring Enzo Fernández during the closing stages, was wasteful with a decent opportunity. Yet Cole Palmer was quiet and João Pedro was crowded out by Palace’s imposing back three before making away for Liam Delap.
Palace had plenty of moments; there was one gorgeous piece of play from Wharton, pirouetting and sending Jean-Philippe Mateta through to test Sanchez, while Eze had a chance to win it on the counterattack.
In the end the mind went back to Eze being denied by officialdom. “I think there was no influence with Eb’s strike but the referee said Marc was too close so we have to accept it,” Glasner said. Palace’s manager looked to the future, insisting that Eze will start in his side’s Conference League playoff against Fredrikstad on Thursday.
Chelsea will continue to evolve. They created little and remain likely to strengthen their attack with Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons. A share of the spoils with a decent side is no cause for anyone to panic.
