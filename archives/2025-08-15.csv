Forest agree to sign McAtee with three more deals in pipeline,Nottingham Forest have agreed a deal worth up to &#163;30m with Manchester City for James McAtee - and are working on three more signings.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13411844/james-mcatee-nottingham-forest-agree-deal-for-man-city-midfielder-with-omari-hutchinson-transfer-close,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:28:00",,['Manchester City'],"Nottingham Forest have agreed a deal worth up to £30m with Manchester City for James McAtee - and are working on three more signings.
Sky Sports News understands that sell-on and buy-back clauses have been included in the agreement for the midfielder.
McAtee, 22, came through Manchester City's academy and made 34 appearances for the first team, scoring seven goals, having had two spells on loan at Sheffield United.
The England U21 international started three Premier League games last season, playing 27 times in total for Pep Guardiola's side.
Forest have spent £44m so far this summer on winger Dan Ndoye and striker Igor Jesus while extending the contract of Morgan Gibbs-White, having sold forward Anthony Elanga to Newcastle for £55m.
The club will compete in the Europa League this season and are targeting more signings in Omari Hutchinson, Douglas Luiz and Arnaud Kalimuendo. Forest are also in talks with Callum Hudson-Odoi over a new contract.
Forest are close to agreeing a £37.5m deal with Ipswich for winger Hutchinson.
Forest had a bid worth £35m rejected by Ipswich, which was the same value as his relegation clause that has now expired.
Hutchinson was not in the squad for Friday's Championship opener at Birmingham City due to illness. It's understood he wants to make the move back to the Premier League.
Brentford also held an interest in Hutchinson earlier in the window but failed to agree a deal.
Forest have also approached Juventus over a potential deal for midfielder Luiz.
Two Premier League clubs have bids in for Luiz that are being considered, Sky Sports News understands.
Forest have identified the former Aston Villa midfielder as a target for the final weeks of the window.
Contact has now been established between the clubs and Juventus are open to offers for the 27-year-old.
The Brazil international has struggled to settle in Turin since joining from Villa last summer.
Forest are in talks with Rennes over a deal for striker Kalimuendo.
The 23-year-old France international is among the most sought-after forwards in the final weeks of the window.
RB Leipzig and Villarreal have also been keen to sign him but the German club are finalising a deal for striker Romulo instead.
Kalimuendo has been tracked by other Premier League clubs too.
He is a former PSG youth player with 40 goals and 14 assists in 112 appearances since joining Rennes.
Forest and Callum Hudson-Odoi are progressing in talks over a new contract.
Hudson-Odoi has entered the final year of his contract and has been the subject of interest from several clubs in England and Europe.
The 24-year-old played a key part for Forest last season, scoring five goals and producing two assists in 37 appearances.

How pragmatic Frank is already changing Tottenham,Tottenham contriving to lose two-goal leads in both the match and the penalty shoot-out in their Super Cup defeat might make it tempting for some to view this as the 'same old Spurs'. But this was different. Thomas Frank's fingerprints were all over the performance.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13411767/thomas-franks-tottenham-super-cup-showed-set-piece-strength-long-balls-and-pressing-8211-but-flexibility-will-also-be-key,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 17:34:00",Adam Bate,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham contriving to lose two-goal leads in both the match and the penalty shoot-out in their Super Cup defeat might make it tempting for some to view this as the 'same old Spurs'. But this was different. Thomas Frank's fingerprints were all over the performance.
The new Tottenham boss did not get the result that he wanted against Paris Saint-Germain. The boost of silverware in his very first competitive game in charge would have been a huge moment for him. But there can be no denying that his ideas were evident.
Frank's own assessment that ""the operation was a success but the patient died"" seemed fair. The tactics were largely vindicated. Even Luis Enrique said they deserved to win, only for PSG to belatedly show their true quality and snaffle away the trophy.
""What a mentality throughout the game. A lot of things to be happy with."" That was Frank's verdict. What will be fascinating to see is how much he tweaks those tactics given that it is Burnley up next before travelling to face Manchester City the week after.
It should provide an early insight into Frank's flexibility.
His influences in Udine were both overt and subtle. Most obviously, there were the two goals from set-pieces. Both centre-backs scoring could not have been more perfect given that this was a feature of his success at Brentford, proving almost a trademark.
No team in the Premier League scored more headed goals than Frank's Bees last season. They had the highest average shot quality from set-pieces and a conversion rate second only to Liverpool. Brentford also conceded the fewest goals per set-piece.
Frank has long understood that these 'cheap' goals can be the marginal gains that make the difference and there will be Tottenham supporters who will appreciate this attention to detail because the ingredients are there for this to be a major weapon for Spurs too.
Nine of the starting line-up against PSG were over six feet tall. ""We knew that was an area where we could hurt PSG and we worked very hard on it."" He talked of a ""big focus on the set-pieces from all areas of the pitch"" and stressed that he would keep doing it.

The opener came from a free-kick won near the halfway line and pumped towards the far post by Guglielmo Vicario. Frank is fond of creating overloads and it was noticeable that Spurs were looking for the free man at the back. It worked for their second goal.
While Frank talked of going ""a little more direct"" the reality is that this represents a more fundamental shift for Spurs, one hinted at when it became clear that Kevin Danso had won the long-throw competition in training. He took them from right and left in Udine.
But nothing illustrates the change more clearly than the instructions given to Vicario. Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham played the fewest long passes of any team in the Premier League last season - sticking to that regardless of personnel or opposition.
As a result, the two goalkeepers to play the fewest long passes per 90 minutes in the competition both played for Tottenham - Fraser Forster going long slightly less often than Vicario. But the Italian's pass map against PSG showed there was a different approach.
Luis Enrique's side are so fond of pressing that their tactics include booting the ball up the field from kick-offs just so that they can box in the opponent. Frank wanted his team to bypass that, robbing PSG of that opportunity, and it worked for much of the match.
This ability to adjust is a big reason why Frank is in the job, of course. Postecoglou's failure to do so was a factor in them conceding 65 goals last term, the most by Spurs in over 30 years and their most in a 38-game league season since the First World War.
Tottenham's record against stronger sides was particularly appalling last season, losing 14 of their 16 Premier League games against teams that finished in the top eight. That was more than Leicester and Ipswich and even as many as bottom club Southampton.

Going to a 5-3-2 shape, something that he also did at Brentford, suggests there is a template for those games now. He decided upon it after losing 4-0 to Bayern Munich in pre-season. ""I knew we had to do something a little bit different against PSG,"" he said.
The big question that remains is how Frank adjusts the style against weaker opposition. A clue will come on Saturday when Spurs face Burnley. Tasked with breaking down the team with the best defence in England last season, that should be a very different test.
It is the sort of game for which James Maddison or, dare it be said, Morgan Gibbs-White or Eberechi Eze, might prove especially useful in picking out that pass to unlock things. Without them, it has the potential to be an awkward opener given the turnaround time.
But Frank may have a fresh tactical plan. That has been the case ever since his Brentford were promoted to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2021 only to alter their approach upon promotion and survive comfortably, while the previous season's top two in the Championship - Norwich and Watford - were both relegated.
Even last season, Brentford spent a higher proportion of time in a low block than any other team - and yet somehow managed to rank among the top three teams for possession won in the final third. He can flick the switch been pressing and defending deep.

There was evidence of that against PSG because for all the pressure that the Champions League winners were able to assert in the closing stages, there were also examples of Spurs getting after them. ""High pressure is a non-negotiable,"" said Frank.
That could be seen in the efforts of Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and particularly Pape Sarr, the midfield trio showing great enthusiasm to force PSG wide and support the wing-backs to cut out the crosses. Had all three stayed on, Spurs may have won.
For those who travelled to Italy, that lament may linger. But as Frank himself has said, he only allows himself 24 hours to wallow after a defeat. ""I will make sure the players are ready and come flying out on Saturday."" Do not be shocked if the tactics change again.

Why Liverpool's spending spree has piled pressure and scrutiny on Slot,"Liverpool's spending spree has put head coach Arne Slot under increased pressure to repeat title success, says BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjeydgeqweqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 05:24:08",Phil McNulty,['Liverpool'],"Arne Slot arrived at Liverpool last summer without fanfare into an atmosphere of uncertainty following his iconic predecessor Jurgen Klopp's shock decision to leave Anfield.
The 46-year-old Dutch coach built a fine reputation with successes at Feyenoord, but was an unknown quantity to many Liverpool supporters and untested in the Premier League.
Slot's understated persona was in sharp contrast to the charismatic Klopp, whose departure shaped expectations to the extent that a top-four finish and continued Champions League football was the widely accepted target for Liverpool's fanbase.
The pressure of being Liverpool manager is ever-present - but early expectation management in the new era meant levels were adjusted accordingly.
Fast forward a remarkable 12 months and Slot's Liverpool start the new campaign as Premier League champions, strolling to the title with a 10-point margin and four games to spare, barely threatened from Christmas onwards.
What should have been a summer of celebration has been lived under the shadow of the tragic death of much-loved forward Diogo Jota, killed in a car crash, and the incident in which many Liverpool fans were injured at the title parade.
In the purely sporting context, however, the landscape has shifted dramatically for the club - and with it comes increasing pressure and scrutiny on Slot to deliver more success.
After barely dipping into his spending pot last summer, Slot now has an array of new talent at his disposal following a remarkable summer spending spree that could yet comfortably top £300m - making the Reds firm favourites to retain their crown.
Liverpool have signed Florian Wirtz, one of Europe's hottest properties, in a £116m deal from Bayer Leverkusen, a new pair of full-backs in Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong for a combined £70m from Bayer Leverkusen and Bournemouth respectively, then added Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike in a deal that could be worth £70m.
Add to this the possibility that Crystal Palace captain and defensive lynchpin Marc Guehi could sign for £35m is growing. They have also secured a £26m move for 18-year-old centre-back Giovanni Leoni from Parma.
Liverpool may yet add Newcastle United's £150m-rated rebel striker Alexander Isak to their ranks, which effectively means Slot cannot afford to fail to deliver a trophy and a challenge for the biggest prizes - namely another title and the Champions League.
Can cool Slot handle the heat?
Slot will know better than anyone that he, as well as his expensively reassembled side, will be viewed through a completely different prism this season.
Liverpool are now the hunted rather than the hunters. A campaign without a trophy would be regarded as failure, while rivals Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City in particular, have also strengthened heavily to ensure there is no repeat of last season's one-team title race.
Slot has shown a cool head from day one, barely losing his composure, apart from at the conclusion of an incendiary 2-2 Merseyside derby draw at Goodison Park in February, when he was one of four sent off after the final whistle.
Former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy is confident Slot can deal with the added pressure, telling BBC Sport: ""I don't see Slot being the kind of manager who gets too preoccupied with pressure. He looks very calm. He seems to be very articulate and knows how to handle different situations.""
He added: ""Slot's temperament throughout last season was pretty exquisite. There were not too many times where he seemed rattled.
""I know you could say it is easier to be calm and articulate when you are winning games, but even when they lost to Paris St-Germain in the Champions League, or when they lost to Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup final, he still remained really calm and controlled.
""He was good with his words, said the right things. There was still a real clear focus from him, so I don't see him being too affected by the outside noise. He has shown he can cope with that.
""Expectation has changed, no doubt, at Liverpool there is always a certain amount of expectation anyway, but now he has won the league and spent most of the season playing phenomenal football.
""That high bar is set by Slot now, and an expectation to a degree, but there is also a reality around a group of new players at any time.
""Whether you have just won the league or have finished sixth, there is still going to be an adaptation period where those players need to grow into their roles and become comfortable in those positions.""
Is Slot's Liverpool now a team in transition?
Slot has been at pains to point out that Liverpool's incomings have been accompanied by departures, with Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving for Real Madrid on a free transfer, forwards Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez sold to Bayern Munich and Al-Hilal respectively, while defender Jarell Quansah made the journey in the opposition direction to Wirtz and Frimpong to join Bayer Leverkusen.
It is an unusual amount of churn for champions, showing in a disjointed performance in the Community Shield loss to Crystal Palace, which saw Frimpong, Kerkez, Wirtz and Ekitike start in a performance suggesting a work in progress, lacking last season's calm and cohesion.
The absence of midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, suspended for Friday's opener at home to Bournemouth, hit hard as Liverpool looked a team of too many attacking parts without a solid midfield base, exposed too often.
Slot must find a way to fit Wirtz – so effective across the line of attacking positions as well as from deeper positions - into his plans. How will this impact on the smooth-running midfield of last season, where Gravenberch, Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister were a well-oiled machine?
Murphy said: ""I think Liverpool fans, and probably Slot himself, will be aware that there might be some bumps in the road because you are talking about really young players coming in into an environment they have never been used to, with that expectation of the Liverpool public, with that magnifying glass on every performance.
""That is something those players won't have had before. No disrespect, but at Leverkusen or Frankfurt it is not quite the same pressure, but the Liverpool fans will know that and will understand that will be new for some of the players.
""Liverpool started last season really well. This was mainly obviously to do with the quality of players they had, but also there wasn't any integration of new players. They all knew each other.
""It is different this time. There is also the pressure of being at a club where you are expected to win every week. We are in this kind of grey area where we are waiting to see who fits in smoothly, who adapts the most quickly, who gains momentum the quickest.""
Liverpool fans trust Slot to oversee change
Any doubts about Slot's ability to succeed a figure as beloved as Klopp were swept away in the euphoria of the club's 20th title, where his calm command and tactical shrewdness kept the best of his predecessor's ""Heavy Metal"" football while making Liverpool more controlled, less likely to fall victims to self-created chaos.
Slot's status on The Kop means he had earned their trust to manage the process.
Murphy said: ""Liverpool fans probably didn't expect what happened last season. They are aware there has been a turnaround of quite a few players, so if the season doesn't start brilliantly smoothly, with them winning every game, they will still stay right behind Slot because they know what he is capable of. He has credit in the bank. He hardly put a foot wrong in his first season.""

Forest agree double deal for Hutchinson & McAtee,Nottingham Forest agree deals worth £37.5m for Ipswich Town winger Omari Hutchinson and nearly £30m for Manchester City's James McAtee.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c206p5zn1k3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 20:14:37",Nick Mashiter,['Manchester City'],"Nottingham Forest have agreed deals worth £37.5m for Ipswich Town winger Omari Hutchinson and nearly £30m for Manchester City's James McAtee.
The deal for 22-year-old McAtee is also expected to include a sell-on and buy-back clause.
Forest had been considering their next move for Hutchinson, 21, after a £35m offer was rejected by the Tractor Boys at the weekend.
Midfielder McAtee, who captained England Under-21s to Euro 2025 victory in the summer, has been a long-term target for Forest.
He made 27 appearances for City last season but just three Premier League starts.
Forest are also in advanced talks for Rennes striker Arnaud Kalimuendo before Sunday's Premier League opener at home to Brentford, with all three deals worth close to £90m.
The club have been looking for wide reinforcements, having sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle for a club-record deal of an initial £55m, external, and have already signed Dan Ndoye from Bologna.
Brentford also had a £35m bid turned down last month for Hutchinson, despite the offer meeting his relegation release clause.
Since the offer was not cash up front, though, it was rejected and the clause expired.
The Bees did come back to the table after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, but were unable to agree a deal with Ipswich, leaving Forest in pole position to bring him to the City Ground.
Hutchinson - who scored in England Under-21's extra-time final victory against Germany in June after being set up by McAtee - joined Town from Chelsea for £20m last summer after spending 2023-24 on loan at Portman Road, helping Ipswich into the Premier League.
He scored three goals in 31 league games last season but was unable to stop Kieran McKenna's side dropping back into the Championship.
Ipswich, who drew their opening Championship game 1-1 at Birmingham, also sold striker Liam Delap to Chelsea in a £30m deal after he scored 12 goals last season.

A thrilling opening weekend also includes Manchester United hosting Arsenal, before Leeds make their return to the top flight when they welcome Everton on Monday.
It has been a busy summer on and off the field, with Chelsea winning the Club World Cup in the United States after Manchester City went out in the last 16.
We have taken a look at some of the new things you can expect to see over the 2025-26 campaign.
What new managers and new players are in the Premier League?
Ange Postecoglou said he always won a trophy in his second season in charge of a club and that prediction came true as he guided Tottenham to the Europa League thanks to a 1-0 win over Manchester United in Bilbao, Spain.
That came on 21 May, but it was not enough to keep the Australian in a job as he was sacked 16 days later - with Thomas Frank moving across London from Brentford to replace him.
The Bees then promoted Keith Andrews from set-piece coach to become their new boss.
Liverpool won the Premier League title in 2024-25 to become English champions for a record-equalling 20th time.
However, Arne Slot's side have been the biggest spenders in the summer with Germany midfielder Florian Wirtz joining for an initial fee of £100m from Bayer Leverkusen, in a deal that could be worth £116m.
The Reds may be set to beat that club record transfer if they are able to sign striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle. Liverpool have also signed striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt, left-back Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth and right-back Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen.
Arsenal and Manchester United have both signed strikers as the Gunners bought Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting in a move worth a potential £64m, while United's fee for Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig could reach £73.7m.
Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, runners-up in each of the past three seasons, have also purchased defensive midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and winger Noni Madueke from Chelsea.
Other major moves have seen Manchester United bolster their attacking options with the signings of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Matheus Cunha from Wolves. Chelsea have signed two strikers, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap, from Brighton and Ipswich Town respectively, and winger Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund.
Newcastle bought winger Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for an initial £52m, Manchester City signed AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders for a fee of £46.5m and Tottenham paid £55m to buy Mohammed Kudus from West Ham.
What new teams are in the Premier League?
Leeds United and Burnley both reached 100 points in the Championship to finish in the top two and secure returns to the Premier League.
For the Clarets, they were only out of the top flight for one season, but will be hoping to stay in the division for more than one campaign after being relegated in 2021-22, promoted the following year, relegated in 2023-24 and then promoted again.
Leeds had been in the Championship for two seasons before winning the title in 2024-25. The third team to come up was Sunderland as they clinched a dramatic 2-1 play-off final win over Sheffield United at Wembley in May to return to the top tier for the first time since 2016-17.
Tom Watson, who scored the Black Cats' 95th-minute winner, has since moved to Brighton while midfielder Jobe Bellingham has joined Borussia Dortmund.
However, the newly promoted trio have all spent big in an attempt to stay in the Premier League.
They will be hoping to have more luck than the three sides that came up in 2023-24 as Southampton, Ipswich Town and Leicester City were all relegated 12 months later.
What new laws are in the Premier League?
The biggest change means a goalkeeper holding the ball for more than eight seconds will be punished with a corner for the opposition.
It is hoped this will clamp down on time-wasting.
Until now the law had been six seconds and the punishment of an indirect free-kick - but it was barely ever applied.
Referees will warn the goalkeepers with a five-second countdown.
The new law applies across football as a whole and was seen in action at the Club World Cup.
Another change means only captains will be allowed to approach referees during Premier League matches this season.
Yellow cards can be shown to players who approach officials without permission and behave in a disrespectful manner.
If the captain is a goalkeeper, a team can provide an alternate player before kick-off.
Players will be allowed to retake a penalty if they accidental touch it twice while kicking it... so long as the effort went in.
The new law has already been used this summer in the Women's European Championship final penalty shootout. England's Beth Mead slipped with a double touch as she scored a penalty in the shootout against Spain - and had to retake it, with her second effort saved by keeper Cata Coll.
But under the old laws she would not even have been allowed to retake it, with a miss recorded instead.
What is the new Premier League television deal?
In December 2023, the Premier League agreed a new record £6.7bn domestic television deal for Sky and TNT to show up to 270 live games a season, with the BBC continuing to show highlights on Match of the Day.
The deal begins in 2025-26 and covers four years and was described as the ""largest sports media rights deal ever concluded in the UK"".
The Saturday 3pm blackout will remain in place, but every 2pm Sunday kick-off will be televised.
Sky were awarded four of the five packages and will show a minimum of 215 matches a season, up from 128 games in 2024-25. That will include Saturday 5.30pm kick-offs, Sunday 2pm and 4.30pm kick-offs, plus evening games on Mondays and Fridays and three midweek rounds.
TNT will show a minimum of 52 matches a season including all 12.30pm kick-offs on Saturdays and two midweek match rounds.
Sky Sports will also broadcast all 10 matches on the final day of each season.

What is ref cam?
The Premier League will test out referee cameras in selected matches this season.
It is set to be trialled over six to eight weeks, with the idea to make the technology a permanent feature for the rest of the season. It is unlikely to be in place for the first match of the season.
Referees will wear cameras on their shirts during matches and have an ear-piece and microphone attached.
The idea of RefCam is to offer TV viewers a unique view of football action, but no controversial incidents will be shown.
RefCams will not offer live footage but will be used in replays of match incidents from a different perspective.

Guehi analysis - why 'Uncle Marc' would be Liverpool's smartest buy,"With Liverpool in talks to sign Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi, we analyse what he would bring to the Reds.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gm32m404zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:38:54",Umir Irfan,['Liverpool'],"At about £40m, Liverpool target Marc Guehi appears to provide genuine answers for numerous tactical conundrums the Reds might face going into the 25-26 season.
Talks have taken place over the transfer of the Crystal Palace captain, with the England international likely to move to Merseyside.
Off the back of an incredibly impressive campaign, Arne Slot and his Premier League champions have opted to overhaul the squad by bringing in mainly offensive reinforcements, even in the form of the defenders signed, and their spending this summer is already close to £300m.
Guehi, as good as he is defensively, appears to follow that trend.
Here we analyse what he would bring to Liverpool, assessing how he might adapt from a counter-attacking side to a more possession-based team, and whether he can improve the Premier League champions.
Guehi's positional versatility
What stands out immediately is Guehi's tactical versatility and his on-ball quality.
He is a player who has shown a proficiency for passing and dribbling off both feet and is a strong carrier of the ball, pushing past nearby attackers and establishing territory higher up the pitch.
His quality isn't limited to one area either.
Although he has primarily been deployed as a left centre-back in a back three for Crystal Palace by head coach Oliver Glasner, he often finds himself in the middle of the defence, particularly on the ball.
This versatility across the back line has been notable in his cameos for England too, with Guehi impressively showcasing his quality in a back four.
Given Virgil van Dijk's age, Gomez's injury record and the departure of Jarell Quansah, the introduction of a player of Guehi's quality who can play on both sides would be seen as a huge plus for Liverpool.
Now let's consider Crystal Palace's five-at-the-back, counter-attacking system to Liverpool's high-possession, four-at-the-back.
Glasner has cleverly set up his centre-backs in a way that allows them to get on the ball facing forwards under less pressure, which has given Guehi the time and space to showcase his on-ball quality.
Amid this, his passing quality has stood out in spite of the reduced possession.
For most ball-dominant teams, this time and space isn't always afforded to the centre-backs. Liverpool are an exception here and their use of Van Dijk and Wataru Endo in pre-season provides clues how Liverpool can use Guehi in a similarly effective manner.
Will we see Liverpool play with a back three this season?
In pre-season, a noticeable pattern arose in the form of Liverpool moving to a back three when they had the ball.
As seen in the 3-2 win against Athletic Bilbao and the Community Shield loss to Palace, Liverpool's back four clearly became a back three, with Jeremie Frimpong pushing up on the right flank in possession.
Milos Kerkez, one of Van Dijk or Endo, and Konate formed a back three tasked with progressing the ball.
The midfield in front of them was incredibly dynamic, with players like Dominik Szoboszlai and Florian Wirtz dropping deep to pull apart the opposition's defensive shape, before being found by the back three.
The use of both Endo and Van Dijk in possession, despite starting at left centre-back, was in the middle of a back three, sitting deeper and dictating play. The increased distance between the opponents' attackers and Liverpool's left centre-back meant Van Dijk had more time and space to play a pass or to carry the ball up the field.
Could Guehi adapt to this?
Yes, by replicating the tactical conditions that made him a success at Palace. And in the Liverpool system, he would have more time and space to showcase his on-ball quality.
The central positioning would allow him to play at a variety of angles, utilising his two-footedness and impressive ability to switch play to either flank.
Guehi can help Liverpool win the ball back high up the pitch
When Liverpool lose the ball, they press high up the pitch collectively, aiming to win the ball back immediately.
In pre-season, defenders have found themselves in difficult individual duels around the halfway line.
With Guehi's strong physical base and willingness to step up the field to apply pressure, he is well equipped to follow Slot's out-of-possession instructions.
Although his aerial ability is not his biggest attribute, Guehi has duelled well on the ground towards the left side of the pitch. His ability to utilise his body and tackle with both feet after stepping up into the opposition half for Palace will be a much needed quality in covering for the attacking full-backs of Liverpool.
For Palace, Guehi has developed over the last few years as a strong last-ditch defender, having played for a side that doesn't dominate the ball.
When Liverpool need to see out games, Slot opted last season for Endo as an extra defender to tighten up. In a similar manner, the box-defending and assured nature of Guehi makes him a perfect player in those situations.
Guehi: Good signing or not?
With Quansah joining Bayer Leverkusen from Liverpool for £35m, spending a similar fee on an England international defender with top-level Premier League experience appears to be an astute market opportunity.
As a respected leader and captain for Palace, playfully referred to as ""Uncle Marc"" by his England team-mates because of his maturity and temperament, he fits into the culture Liverpool have fostered over this recent period of success.
The market opportunity paired with his tactical fit makes Guehi to Liverpool a transfer that may be looked back at as a genuine bargain in a bloated market.

Inspired by Van Dijk and Smalling - Liverpool agree £26m deal for Leoni,"Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma, Reds manager Arne Slot reveals.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9wyvjl2ky4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 09:34:57",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma, Reds manager Arne Slot has revealed.
The centre-half has been a key target for Slot and is now set to move to Anfield in a deal worth in the region of £26m.
The Italy Under-19s international began his career at Padova and had a short spell at Sampdoria before joining Parma last summer.
He enjoyed a breakthrough Serie A campaign last season, making 17 appearances as Parma finished 16th, five points above the relegation zone.
""The clubs have agreed a deal but he has not signed for us yet. The moment he does, I can go into more detail,"" Slot said.
The Reds boss refused to comment when asked about a potential move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi.
""He's not our player. Unfortunately, he was the captain of the team who we lost to last Sunday. If you want to have any talks about him you should go to Palace and [manager Oliver] Glasner and ask him about it,"" Slot said.
FA Cup winners Palace are believed to want £40m for their captain, who only has 12 months left on his contract, but Liverpool want to pay less than that.
Eagles chairman Steve Parish said earlier this week Guehi might be sold to avoid him moving on a free transfer next summer.
If the clubs do agree a deal, the level of playing time he would be afforded at Liverpool will be a crucial consideration for Guehi in a World Cup year.
The Reds have already spent about £270m this summer, though they have recouped about £170m through player sales.
They have also had a £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle, though sources have told BBC Sport the Swede remains determined to move to the Premier League champions.
Signing Leoni, Guehi and Isak would take Liverpool's summer spending past £400m.
Defending champions Liverpool begin their 2025-26 Premier League campaign in Friday's curtain-raiser against Bournemouth at Anfield.
Inspired by Van Dijk & Smalling - Who is Leoni?
Leoni only made his senior debut in 2023, playing in the Italian third tier for Padova as a 16-year-old, but just two years later he is set for the Premier League.
After making his debut in March 2023, he told Padova's club website, external he was ""inspired"" by Van Dijk and former Manchester United defender Chris Smalling, who at the time was playing for Roma.
Liverpool have been looking for reinforcements in central defence since selling Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen last month, and although Guehi remains very much in their sights, Leoni would provide extra cover in an area where the Reds are potentially light – captain Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate were their only fit senior central defenders for the Community Shield.
With Van Dijk now 34, Liverpool need to have an eye on future options, and 18-year-old Leoni not only ticks that box but also looks ready now, despite only establishing himself in Parma's starting line-up in the second half of last season.
With just 14 top-flight starts under his belt, he has not played as much as fellow highly rated teenage centre-backs Pau Cubarsi, Mamadou Sarr or Dean Huijsen, but his stats are impressive. At 6ft 5in, he is exceptional in the air, ranking in the top 10% for aerial duels won in Serie A last season.
At Parma, the Italy U19 international played in the middle of the back three or as the right centre-back. As well as his aerial strength, he is also composed in possession, especially given his lack of experience.
Leoni will probably have to be patient for his chances. But the opportunity to develop his game with the Premier League champions, and learn from Van Dijk, who he has previously called his inspiration, appears to have helped clinch the move.
'A huge opportunity' for Leoni
Leoni is very strong in the air and he's a technically gifted player as well. He can come out from defence and start building from the back, but he's obviously at his most impactful in the air.
A couple of big clubs in Italy, including AC Milan and Inter Milan, were also after him, so I didn't expect a bold move from a Premier League club so early, to be honest. But Liverpool put the money on the table - probably even a bit more than Parma were originally asking for.
Who wouldn't fancy playing at Anfield? I think any player would be happy to join Liverpool - and, of course, the Premier League, which is the most entertaining and attractive league in the world right now.
I would have loved to see Giovanni join a big Italian club before moving abroad. But that's football - the market is open. If a club like Liverpool comes in with 30m euros plus bonuses, it's difficult to turn down such an offer.
It will be difficult for him to start regularly - he knows that - but I don't think that's a major problem at his age.
Having the opportunity to be part of such a strong squad and play alongside great players, especially someone like Van Dijk, is a huge opportunity.

Roma make £20m bid to sign Man Utd outcast Sancho,"Roma make an offer to buy England winger Jadon Sancho from Manchester United, where he remains excluded from training with the first team.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gzkz0wg44o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 13:03:42",Sami Mokbel,['Manchester United'],"Roma have made a £20m offer to sign England winger Jadon Sancho from Manchester United, where he remains excluded from training with the first-team squad.
The 25-year-old, who has been told to find a new club before the transfer window closes on 1 September, joined United for £73m four years ago.
Juventus, who unlike Roma have qualified for this season's Champions League, are also known to be interested in Sancho.
The former Borussia Dortmund wide man returned to United in the summer after Chelsea paid a £5m penalty to get out of an obligation to buy him, having spent last season on loan at Stamford Bridge.
There have also been suggestions that Roma would be interested in a loan, containing clauses that could be triggered at the end of the season.
However, that issue is complicated by the fact that Sancho's United contract expires next summer. The club does have an option to extend it by an additional year, although given Sancho's salary, it is debatable whether they would be willing to do that.
United are determined to sell Sancho. However, the closer to September they get without a deal in place, the more likely they are to consider a potential loan move, given it would at least take a significant sum off their wage bill.
Four players - Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia - have been training away from boss Ruben Amorim's squad since the start of pre-season last month as the club believes they will have left before the window closes.

Man City embrace Manchester weather with third kit,"Manchester City's jersey features a raindrop graphic over a grey background, taking inspiration from the city's wet weather.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czr61yprr51o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:39:53",Emily Salley,['Manchester City'],"Manchester has long been labelled as the rainy city.
Embracing this legacy, Manchester City have now used the wet weather as inspiration for their new third kit for the 2025-26 season.
City's latest jersey features a raindrop graphic over a grey background, with neon green accents on the neck, shoulders and sides.
""This kit is for the City that plays in the rain,"" the club said.
""The shirt is designed for those who carry City in their hearts, rain or shine.""
Greater Manchester sees on average 1,087mm of rainfall a year, according to the Met Office, and there are on average 166 days a year with at least 1mm of rain.
Greater London, in comparison, has on average 114 days with at least 1mm of rain a year.
Despite this, the Manchester Evening News reported, external in 2017 that Manchester ranked 15th in a table of the wettest towns and cities in the UK.
Manufactured by Puma, the new City shirt retails online for between £65 - for the kids' jersey - and £152 for an ""authentic jersey"" with a name and number printed on the back.
""Grey skies may often be seen overhead in Manchester, but this City brings electrifying football to the pitch whatever the weather,"" the club added.
""The kit carries a message from Manchester: even when it rains, we shine.""
They also said the vibrant neon green accents symbolise ""the standout quality"" of Manchester City.
The rain-inspired kit did not appear to go down well with some City fans on social media, with one supporter reacting ""can you unrelease it please"", while another said ""this might just end up being the most terrible kit in the history of the Prem"".
It is not the only City kit that has split opinion in recent years. Last season's fourth kit - co-designed by Oasis star Noel Gallagher - drew criticism, while a number of fans were unimpressed by the 2021-22 third kit which replaced the club's badge with 'Man City' spelt out in capital letters.
Last month, National League side Forest Green Rovers launched a vegan kit with a  fluorescent leopard-style print pattern that divided opinion.

Liverpool parade accused faces 24 new charges,Paul Doyle became tearful as he was asked to confirm his identity at Liverpool Crown Court.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47wq93vn2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 10:21:35",,['Liverpool'],"A man accused of deliberately driving into a crowd of fans at Liverpool's Premier League victory parade has been charged with 24 new offences, including attempted grievous bodily harm against two babies.
Paul Doyle, 53, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court over video-link from prison and became tearful as he was asked to confirm his identity.
He was due to enter pleas to the seven counts he originally faced over the incident in May, but the court heard prosecutors had introduced 24 new counts to the indictment.
Mr Doyle, of West Derby in Liverpool, was not asked to enter pleas to any charges after his barrister Simon Csoka KC asked for more time to consider the new counts.
Remand
More than 130 people were injured when a Ford Galaxy car drove into a crowd on Water Street, in Liverpool city centre, on the evening of 26 May.
The court heard 23 of the new charges reflected injuries to victims, while one was a count of affray.
Five of the victims included in the new charges were children aged between six months and 17 years old, the court heard. Two children were included in the original set of charges.
According to the indictment, 17 of the new counts were attempting to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, five of causing GBH with intent and one of wounding with intent to cause GBH.
Mr Csoka told the court his client had only seen the detail of the new charges shortly before the hearing and had not had chance to read through new witness statements.
He said Mr Doyle had applied for a laptop while on remand in prison to enable him to view CCTV and other digital evidence, but that application had still not been decided two months on.
Mr Doyle, who appeared on the video link in a plain grey T-shirt sitting at a desk with a pair of glasses, notepads and several books in front of him, wiped his eyes throughout proceedings.
Judge Andrew Menary KC told Mr Csoka he was willing to give the defence more time before asking for pleas.
""These are serious matters and they are not uncomplicated, and there are practical difficulties in accessing the defendant,"" he said.
The hearing was adjourned until 4 September.
At a previous hearing prosecutors said their case was that Mr Doyle, of Burghill Road in West Derby, had used the car ""as a weapon"".
During that hearing, junior counsel Philip Astbury said it was the prosecution's case that Mr Doyle ""drove deliberately in that car at people amongst that crowd as they tried to leave the area"".
""Six charges of assault reflect the most seriously injured of those who were struck by the vehicle,"" he said.
""The first count of dangerous driving reflects the manner of driving before and up until the point he used his vehicle deliberately as a weapon to injure those individuals.""
He was originally charged with one count of dangerous driving between his home and Water Street, four counts of GBH with intent, one of attempting to cause GBH with intent, and one of wounding with intent to cause GBH.

Why don't Chelsea have a shirt sponsor?,BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team look at why Chelsea are the only Premier League club without a front-of-shirt sponsor.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cn0r9xk94l9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 14:45:07",Max Chesterton,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea are the only Premier League club to start the 2025-26 season without a matchday shirt sponsor after Nottingham Forest agreed a partnership with American gambling firm Bally's.
There is an ongoing competitive process for the front-of-shirt sponsor with Chelsea believed to have had offers, but focused on aligning with the right long-term partner.
The club is aiming to strike a deal worth £60m-£65m per season following qualification for the Champions League and winning the revamped Fifa Club World Cup.
New Saudi Arabia airline Riyadh Air have been strongly linked to a potential sponsorship.
Enzo Maresca's side had no front-of-shirt sponsor last season until the end of April when they were sponsored by Dubai-based property company Damac.
They also started the 2023-24 campaign without a shirt sponsor until agreeing a £40m-plus deal with US sports technology firm Infinite Athlete.
What is happening with gambling sponsorship?
In the 2024-25 campaign, 11 top-flight teams had a gambling sponsor on their matchday shirt, an increase of three from the previous campaign.
None of the Premier League's six wealthiest clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - feature a gambling firm on the front of their shirts.
Premier League clubs also collectively agreed in 2023 to withdraw gambling sponsorship from the front of their kits by the end of the 2025-26 season.
They have been allowed to secure new shirt-front deals this season before the deadline, but will still be able to continue featuring gambling brands in areas such as shirt sleeves and LED advertising in the future.
Under-18s are not allowed to wear shirts with gambling sponsors, meaning young players have featured in games with sponsor-free jerseys.
The ban from next season follows a consultation between the league, its clubs and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) as part of the government's ongoing review of current gambling legislation.
