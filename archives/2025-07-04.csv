Slot pays tribute to 'special' Jota: 'He was a loved one to all of us',"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has paid tribute to ""very special"" Diogo Jota, after the forward was killed in a car accident in Spain.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13392050/diogo-jota-liverpool-head-coach-arne-slot-pays-tribute-to-very-special-forward-after-fatal-car-accident,"Thu, 03 Jul 2025 19:15:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has paid tribute to ""very special"" Diogo Jota, after the forward was killed in a car accident in Spain.
It is understood the 28-year-old and his brother, Andre Silva, 25, died as Jota was returning to Liverpool for pre-season training, which begins next week, and that he was due to take a ferry back to England as he had been advised not to fly following minor surgery.
Jota won the Premier League with Liverpool under Slot's management last season and scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the club after joining from Wolves in 2020. He also lifted an FA Cup and two Carabao Cups with Liverpool.
In a statement released on Liverpool's website, Slot said: ""What to say? What can anyone say at a time like this when the shock and the pain is so incredibly raw? I wish I had the words but I know I do not.
""All I have are feelings that I know so many people will share about a person and a player we loved dearly and a family we care so much about.
""My first thoughts are not those of a football manager. They are of a father, a son, a brother and an uncle and they belong to the family of Diogo and Andre Silva who have experienced such an unimaginable loss.
""My message to them is very clear - you will never walk alone. The players, the staff, the supporters of Liverpool Football Club are all with you and from what I have seen today, the same can be said of the wider family of football.
""This is not solely a response to tragedy. It is also a reaction to the goodness of the people involved and the respect that so many have for the boys as individuals and for the family as a whole.
""For us as a club, the sense of shock is absolute. Diogo was not just our player. He was a loved one to all of us. He was a team-mate, a colleague, a workmate and in all of those roles he was very special.
""I could say so much about what he brought to our team but the truth is everyone who watched Diogo play could see it. Hard work, desire, commitment, great quality, goals. The essence of what a Liverpool player should be.
""There were also the parts that not everyone got to see. The person who never sought popularity but found it anyway. Not a friend to two people, a friend to everyone. Someone who made others feel good about themselves just by being with them. A person who cared deeply for his family.
""The last time we spoke, I congratulated Diogo on winning the Nations League and wished him luck for his forthcoming wedding. In many ways, it was a dream summer for Diogo and his family, which makes it all the more heartbreaking that it should end like this.
""When I first came to the club, one of the first songs I got to know was the one that our fans sing for Diogo. I had not worked with him previously but I knew straight away that if the Liverpool supporters, who have seen so many great players over the years, had such a unique chant for Diogo, he must have special qualities.
""That we have lost those qualities in such terrible circumstances is something we have not yet come to terms with. For this reason, we need everyone at the club to stand together and to be there for one another. We owe this to Diogo, to Andre Silva, to their wider family and to ourselves.
""My condolences go to Diogo's wife, Rute, their three beautiful children and to the parents of Diogo and Andre Silva.
""When the time is right, we will celebrate Diogo Jota, we will remember his goals and we will sing his song. For the time being, we will remember him as a unique human being and mourn his loss. He will never be forgotten.
""His name is Diogo.""
Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk later posted on social media: ""Man, I can't believe it, I don't wanna believe it. Absolutely devastated and in total disbelief.
""What a human being, what a player, but most importantly what an unbelievable family man.
""You meant so much to all of us and you always will! For your family to lose two sons, a husband and a father is just unimaginable. So cruel and unfair.
""My heart is breaking for all of your beautiful family, for Rute and for your kids. I promise you that in these difficult times and beyond we will always be there for your family.
""A champion forever, number 20 forever. It's been a privilege to have stood by your side on the pitch, and to have been your friend off it.
""We will miss you beyond words and never forget you. Your legacy will live on, we will make sure of it!
""Rest in perfect peace Diogo & Andre.""
Liverpool have released a statement on behalf of Billy Hogan, CEO of FSG international, John Henry, founder of FSG, Tom Werner, chairman of FSG, and Mike Gordon, president of FSG:
On behalf of the leadership teams at Liverpool Football Club and Fenway Sports Group, we offer our sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of our number 20 - Diogo Jota, and his brother Andre Silva.
This tragic situation and the reality of it is truly shocking, devastating and has left us numb with grief. We therefore cannot imagine how the immediate and wider family of these remarkable brothers must be feeling. Our thoughts, prayers and support are with them all.
We all know what Diogo could do on the field of play and the vital role he played in our successes since he joined this club in 2020. How he quickly became a firm fan favourite, and his song reverberated around Anfield and in stadiums across the world.
So many special moments, so many special memories.
But beyond the player that we all knew, was a wonderfully humble human being, he was sincere, intelligent, funny, tough and created connections with people everywhere he went. He had a zest for life that was utterly contagious. Diogo was a loving father, son, husband and brother, and we, and everyone who knew him, will miss him deeply as we all try and process the enormity of today.
Rest in peace, Diogo and Andre. You Will Never Walk Alone.
Billy, John, Tom, Mike.
Liverpool also released a statement on behalf of Michael Edwards, FSG's chief executive of football, and Richard Hughes, the club's sporting director:
There is nothing that we can say in this moment to ease the pain of such a devastating tragedy. We all feel utterly bereft right now.
In such heartbreaking circumstances, it is our responsibility to acknowledge the collective grief we are experiencing, to pay tribute to our Diogo, and to offer unwavering support to his family who remain our absolute priority at this time.
Diogo's wife, Rute, their three beautiful children, his parents and wider family are facing an unimaginable loss. This tragic accident has taken not only Diogo, but also his brother, Andre Silva. We mourn them both equally. We must respect the family's privacy and give them the space to grieve in whichever way they need.
Of course, we - his Liverpool family - are also struggling to come to terms with what has happened. As his team-mates, friends and colleagues, we are consumed by shock and sorrow. We know our supporters, his national team, former clubs and team-mates and the wider football community share in this grief. This is a tragedy that transcends Liverpool Football Club.
In the coming days, we as a club will look to honour our beloved number 20 with the respect and affection he so richly deserves. We will strive to make these tributes meaningful and inclusive of our supporters, to whom Diogo meant so much.
For now, we express a love that is filled with deep sorrow and pain. We have lost someone truly irreplaceable.
Rest in peace, Diogo.
Jurgen Klopp - who signed Jota for Liverpool - said he was heartbroken to hear of his former player's passing.
In an Instagram post, he said: ""This is a moment where I struggle! There must be a bigger purpose! But I can't see it!
""I'm heartbroken to hear about the passing of Diogo and his brother Andre. Diogo was a not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father! We will miss you so much!""
The accident happened at 12.30am local time on Thursday (11.30pm Wednesday BST) on the A-52 motorway in the municipality of Cernadilla, Zamora.
The car Jota and his brother were travelling in left the road and caught fire after a suspected burst tyre while overtaking, according to a statement issued to Sky Sports News by the Civil Guard in Zamora.
Jota had married his long-term partner, Rute Cardoso, less than two weeks ago, and had three children.
Jamie Carragher described his shock at the news and paid tribute to Jota as a ""family man"".
""It's one of the few times the whole football family comes together,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""I cannot believe it, it's so sad and devastating for his family, his wife and three wonderful children.
""He lived really close to us but kept himself to himself. He came across as very quiet and humble, a real family man. Seemed like a great guy and of course a great footballer.
""It's difficult to find the words to say. It's not really about the football and Liverpool right now, but about his family and three lovely kids.
""The summer he's had, he's just won the Premier League with Liverpool, the Nations League with Portugal and got married two weeks ago. It just shows us all how quickly life can change, you can't even comprehend it.
""It makes us all take a step back and look at how important things really are, maybe football itself. We get passionate and heated about the game, myself included, but this makes you think, Why? What for?""
Jota's Liverpool team-mate Darwin Nunez wrote on Instagram: ""There are no words of comfort for so much pain. I will always remember you with your smile, as a good companion on and off the field.
""I send all my strength to his family. From where he is I'm sure he will always be with you, especially his wife and three children.""
Wolves, where Jota spent three years in total, posted a tribute to their former player, saying: ""We are heartbroken.
""Diogo was adored by our fans, loved by his team-mates and cherished by everyone who worked with him during his time at Wolves. The memories he created will never be forgotten.
""Our hearts go out to the family, friends and loved ones of Diogo and his brother, Andre. You will be truly missed and always remembered.""
Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, who played with Jota for the national team, said on social media: ""It doesn't make sense. Just now we were together in the national team, just now you had gotten married.
""To your family, your wife and your children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. I know you will always be with them. Rest in Peace, Diogo and Andre. We will all miss you.""
As well as former clubs, team-mates and managers, tributes were paid to Jota from across the world of football.

Jota's 25-year-old brother, Andre Silva, was also killed in the accident. He was a footballer with Liga Portugal 2 side Penafiel.

Jota was due to report back to Liverpool's training ground for pre-season with the rest of the squad next week.
Sky Sports News understands there will be a wake on Friday afternoon to remember Jota. It will take place in Gondomar, near Porto in Portugal, where the funeral will then take place on Saturday at 10am. Wakes typically take place before the funeral service in Portugal.
The car Jota and his brother were travelling in left the road and caught fire after a suspected burst tyre while overtaking, according to a statement issued to Sky Sports News by the Civil Guard in Zamora.

The forward helped Liverpool win the Premier League title last season and also lifted an FA Cup and two Carabao Cups with the club.
He followed last season's Premier League title triumph by winning the UEFA Nations League for the second time with Portugal in June. In total, he scored 14 goals in 49 games for the national side.
Jota also had spells with Pacos de Ferreira, Porto and Atletico Madrid earlier in his career.

A minute's silence was held for Jota ahead of the Women's Euros matches featuring Spain vs Portugal and Belgium vs Italy on Thursday evening.
Sky Sports News reporter Johnny Phillips, who spent time with Jota during his Wolves career, said: ""He was an incredible presence at Wolves and the club will feel this really deeply.
""He arrived as a 20-year-old to a mid-table Championship team with his great friend Ruben Neves and lifted the place incredibly.
""During Nuno Espirito Santo's rise at Wolves, we made a couple of documentaries and Diogo was really helpful. He was a young kid trying to make his way in Wolverhampton.
""English wasn't his native tongue but he was happy to speak and always did his best. He was incredibly loved at Wolves.
""He was an incredible character on the pitch and an incredible presence off it. A really lovely lad who brought incredible joy to Wolves fans.""
Wolves chairman Jeff Shi said: ""Diogo was a top player and, for me, one of the top three players in the whole 10 years that Fosun and I have been here.
""But he was also a nice boy who was very warm, very nice and always understanding, but he was also demanding.
""As a top player, you sometimes have to demand your team-mates to do well, and although he was never a player on the pitch to shout, you could always see what he wanted from you.
""Diogo will be sorely missed by everyone here at Wolves and our thoughts go out to his family and friends.""

Tomiyasu to end injury-plagued spell at Arsenal,Arsenal defender Takehiro Tomiyasu is leaving the club after reaching an agreement to mutually terminate his contract.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cedgv61x9j9o,"Fri, 04 Jul 2025 06:41:10",Sami Mokbel,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal defender Takehiro Tomiyasu is leaving the club after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract.
The Japan international is recovering from knee surgery having played just six minutes of football last season.
Tomiyasu faces up to another five months out as he continues his rehabilitation from the operation he underwent in February.
The 26-year-old missed the start of last season with a previous knee injury that also required surgery, in 2023.
His existing deal was due to expire at the end of next season but BBC Sport has learned that Arsenal and Tomiyasu have reached a contractual settlement to end his contract.
Tomiyasu, who joined Arsenal from Bologna in 2021, made 79 appearances for the Gunners.
Arsenal have already started looking at defensive reinforcements this summer, with Valencia centre-back Cristhian Mosquera among their targets.
Kieran Tierney has already left Arsenal to join Celtic, while there is also a chance Oleksandr Zinchenko leaves before the summer transfer deadline on Monday, 1 September.

The 20-year-old England Under-21 player will cost £48.5m plus £3.5m in add-ons.
The clubs, who are both in the United States for the Club World Cup, met in Fort Lauderdale to agree the transfer.
Dortmund say contract details are still to be finalised, but BBC Sport has already reported Gittens agreed a seven-year deal with Chelsea in June.
""The talks with Chelsea were challenging, but ultimately we are pleased that we can most likely realise our financial ambitions and then have planning security,"" said Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl.
""Jamie is an outstanding player who has given us a great deal of pleasure. He now wants to take the next step in his career at Chelsea, and we wish him all the best and much success.""
Gittens, who joined Dortmund from Manchester City in 2020, has scored 17 goals and made 14 assists in 107 games for the club.
He would not be able to play for the Blues until after the Club World Cup.

Adored & admired - Jota memories 'will live on forever',"Liverpool supporters have been 'stunned and saddened' by Diogo Jota's tragic death, but memories of the fans' favourite will 'live on forever'.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c994mexdmz2o,"Thu, 03 Jul 2025 14:31:22",Daniel Austin,['Liverpool'],"At the end of May, 60,000 Liverpool supporters serenaded Diogo Jota at Anfield as he paraded the Premier League trophy in front of the Kop.
With a big, beaming grin, he soaked up the celebrations as they sang about him powering the club ""to victory"" with his goals.
A little over a month later and fans across the city and beyond have been left stunned and saddened by his death in a road traffic accident in Spain alongside his brother Andre Silva.
As the news spread, fans began to gather outside Anfield, first laying tributes at the club's Hillsborough disaster memorial before moving to congregate facing a single tree on a stretch of grass next to the Main Stand.
Those there, tears drifting down their cheeks, made clear they were paying tribute to a man with whom they felt a deep a connection, as well as an excellent footballer.
""What a great guy,"" said Dave Williams, an Anfield regular. ""I'm devastated by what's gone on.
""He's so young, just got married, got three kids. It's just so sad. All the memories will live on forever.
""His song will be sung with double venom at the start of the season. He gave everything for the club so we'll have to give everything for him and his family.""
'He was a great character, a real grounded individual'
In the internet age, fans are closer to footballers than ever before. They don't just cheer them on from the stands but see their home life on social media, gain great insight into their personalities, quirks and beliefs, and feel a profound personal rapport with them.
Jota was known to supporters as a laid-back, outgoing and playful character - he would regularly appear laughing and joking in online videos published by Liverpool, and often live streamed himself playing video games.
But the 28-year-old was also focused, tenacious and full of hard graft.
That combination of work ethic and fun-loving affability made him one of the most popular players with a fanbase that loves nothing more than earning success as a collective and then revelling in a party afterwards.
""He's one of the fans' favourites"", said Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. ""The connection was so strong.
""He would chase everything. The fans loved that.
""He was a great character, a real grounded individual. The type of person that you think you could connect with and become friends with. That gregarious nature.
""The success that he has helped bring to this city will never be forgotten.""
Jota played a key role in Liverpool's success under Jurgen Klopp and latterly Arne Slot. His propensity to score crucial goals at key moments earned him a reputation as a player who delivered when it mattered most.
That kind of skill earned him respect across football. Among the array of Liverpool memorabilia and red flowers left in tribute to him at Anfield today were shirts and scarves bearing the badges of Everton, Manchester United, Rangers and more.
The night Jota bond was cemented
It was a game at Arsenal in January 2022 that cemented the solid bond between Jota and Liverpool supporters.
On a Thursday night in the League Cup semi-finals, the forward was rampant. He scored two in an electric performance, twisting and turning the Gunners defenders inside out and finishing with his trademark precision.
Supporters in the away end were in love with him. They chanted raucously, ceaselessly the song which had begun to gather momentum on a recent European away trip from part way through the first half, into the concourse at half-time, and until the full-time whistle.
They scarcely came up for air because they wanted Jota to know what a tremendous night he had given them.
Now some of those same supporters stand outside Anfield, dazed and distressed, staring at red shirts with 'Diogo' emblazoned on the back as the news of his death begins to settle.
""He was such a nice person,"" said Brian Curry, a match-going Liverpool fan.
""He's a legend. He'll be sadly, sadly missed by every fan. I'm sure the Kop, and the players when they go on the pitch, will have him in their heart.""
Jota's 65th and final Liverpool goal, a true poacher's winner against Everton in front of the Kop in April, now stands as a beacon - a moment in time fans can look back on and take joy in the fact they were able to share it with him.
Footballers often mean more to fans than the players themselves will ever know.
But strolling around the Anfield turf on the final day of the season, big shiny silver trophy in hand, and all four stands singing his name, Jota knew he was adored.

'A natural finisher who was always feared by defences',Liverpool forward Diogo Jota has died aged 28. BBC Sport's Phil McNulty pays tribute to the striker's career.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2lkgmg5p7o,"Thu, 03 Jul 2025 11:20:43",Phil McNulty,['Liverpool'],"Diogo Jota, who has died in a car crash aged 28, was a natural goalscorer who played a pivotal role in Liverpool's successes in recent years as well as in Portugal's Nations League triumphs.
Jota signed for Liverpool in a £45m deal from Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2020 after helping Nuno Espirito Santo's side return to the Premier League.
His composure in front of goal made him a match-winner on many occasions under Jurgen Klopp and then Arne Slot.
Indeed, some judges regarded him as Liverpool's most natural finisher, despite the presence in the team of one of the greatest players in the club's history, Mohamed Salah.
When Jota signed, Klopp said: ""He is a player who gives us so many options to use. He's 23 years old, still far away from being kind of a finished article - he has so much potential.
""He has the speed, he can combine with other players, can defend, can press. It gives us real options for different systems.""
Jota brought all this and more to Liverpool.
He was in the team that won a domestic cup double of the FA and League Cups in 2022, and despite latterly being hampered by injuries, he still made vital contributions last season.
It was trademark Jota when he headed the equaliser seconds after coming on as a substitute at Nottingham Forest in January, then scored the winner in the Merseyside derby against Everton in April.
Jota's strike against their Merseyside rivals encapsulated all the qualities that made him an adored figure among Liverpool fans as they recaptured their old dominance domestically.
He took two touches in a packed penalty area - his sleight of foot evading Everton's defence - before he wrong-footed goalkeeper Jordan Pickford with a right-foot finish in front of The Kop.
He had a lengthy spell on the sidelines last season after picking up a rib injury against Chelsea early in the campaign, but when he returned he demonstrated his sure touch in front of goal and the priceless knack of being in the right place at the right time.
Salah understandably claimed more headlines, but Jota's goals were often key and he was a striker always feared by defences because of his finishing prowess.
Having outgrown his local club Gondomar, in the Porto area, he moved to Pacos de Ferreira aged 16.
But his burgeoning career was at risk a year later, when a heart problem was detected during pre-season tests.
Just as he did in front of goal, Jota stayed calm.
""I knew it could mean quitting football, but I didn't believe for a second that it was going to happen,"" he said in 2021.
He missed the entire pre-season and the start of the 2014-15 campaign before being cleared to return.
His drive was evident from the fact he approached the youth team co-ordinator at Pacos de Ferreira, Gilberto Andrade, asking for help to learn a foreign language.
Then 17, he told Andrade he hoped to play abroad one day and wanted to be ready for the opportunity.
His first move abroad was fleeting, joining Atletico Madrid in 2016 before swiftly being loaned to Porto, where his brother Andre Silva, who also died in the crash, was a youth player.
Jota then came to prominence in England when he joined Wolves, initially on loan, from Atletico in July 2017. The move was made permanent as he showed his class, scoring 44 goals in 131 games at Molineux before the switch to Liverpool.
The forward became a hero at Wolves, scoring 18 goals in 46 appearances in all competitions in 2017-18 as they returned to the top flight as Championship title winners.
He enjoyed his best goalscoring return at Liverpool with 21 goals in 55 games in 2021-22, part of an impressive overall haul of 65 in 182 appearances.
Hugely popular with his team-mates and Liverpool supporters, Jota fitted comfortably into Klopp's all-action and potent attack. Then under Slot he was frequently selected as the central striker in preference to high-priced number nine Darwin Nunez as the title came to Anfield for the 20th time last season.
Jota was also a force at international level with Portugal, playing his part in their Nations League final against Spain - the second time he claimed the trophy.
He came on as an extra-time substitute before they won on penalties and that game now carries added poignancy as the final act of a stellar career cut short in its prime.

How is Arsenal's attacking refresh shaping up?,BBC Sport looks at how the work to refresh Mikel Arteta's attacking options at Arsenal is developing.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2zv0y30jno,"Thu, 03 Jul 2025 10:06:56",Sami Mokbel,['Arsenal'],"This promised to be a summer that would bring an injection of attacking flair into the Arsenal squad.
So far, however, it has yielded the arrival of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, concrete moves for deep-lying midfielders Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard, and talks over signing centre-back Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia.
That's not to say the club's executive team - led by sporting director Andrea Berta - haven't been trying to sign attacking players, and that process is now set to accelerate.
First on the agenda is the centre-forward Arsenal so clearly crave, and the club are also working on the signing of up to two attacking midfielders.
BBC Sport looks at how the work to refresh Mikel Arteta's attacking options is developing.
Which forwards are Arsenal looking at?
It is our understanding Arsenal came into the summer with two primary striker targets - RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres.
Well, there was a third -  but the chances of securing Alexander Isak from Newcastle were deemed largely unrealistic.
A move for Slovenia international Sesko has substantial backing from key figures at the Emirates - including Arteta.
BBC Sport has learned the player's agent, Elvis Basanovic, was invited to Arsenal's final home game of the season against Newcastle as a guest of the club.
But a deal to sign Sesko has proved difficult. Sources have indicated there is still no agreement between the 22-year-old and Arsenal, let alone the two clubs.
Of course, a breakthrough could come at any moment - but the suggestion is that striking a deal for Sesko has proved significantly harder than expected.
Part of that may be down to changes towards the top of the club in recent months.
With the Gunners' interest in Sesko well established, Basanovic is understood to have developed a strong relationship with former sporting directors Edu and Jason Ayto.
But with both gone and Berta leading the negotiations, those nurtured relationships are no longer relevant.
And there have been indications in recent days that Arsenal have focused attention on other targets.
The impasse with Sesko could, of course, be a strategic ploy from the Gunners to see if he will accept what to them would be more favourable terms.
Either way, Arsenal are understood to have made headway with a potential move for Gyokeres in recent days.
Significantly, the signing of the Sweden international is understood to have Berta's backing.
Gyokeres was not a strong target for Arsenal prior to Berta's arrival earlier this year, but he believes the 27-year-old could make an instant impact.
And the striker, who is at odds with Sporting over his valuation, is understood to be very keen to join Arsenal.
Should Arsenal sign Sesko or Gyokeres, it is likely to cost them in excess of £70m.
Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins, who Arsenal tried to sign in January, would be a cheaper option - allowing them to spend more elsewhere.
The 29-year-old is open to joining Arsenal - the club he supported as a boy - and it is understood that he and Gyokeres are the two players they have explored moves for in recent days.
Which wingers are Arsenal looking at?
How Arsenal's search for a striker concludes - or, more pertinently, how much they pay - will impact their efforts to strengthen in creative areas.
There is genuine interest in Real Madrid winger Rodrygo, with the belief he could be a game-changing addition to an Arsenal team expected to mount a sustained challenge for the Premier League title.
But whether such a transfer is realistic this summer remains to be seen. There has been no public confirmation that Rodrygo is open to leaving Madrid, though it has been suggested to BBC Sport by a well-placed source that the Spanish side would listen to offers.
If the 24-year-old was available, he would cost at least £70m, which - after spending on a striker - may be too much. It is also understood there are some reservations about whether he could adapt to the physicality of English football.
He would also expect to become one of the highest-paid players at the club.
With all that in mind, Berta is considering other options.
Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon has admirers at Arsenal, who considered a move for the 24-year-old England international last summer.
But it would take a huge fee for Newcastle to even consider selling Gordon given his importance to the team and the fact they are looking to build, not dismantle, their squad as they return to the Champions League.
Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze is also on their list of targets.
The England international, 27, has release clause of £60m plus £8m in potential add-ons in his contract, which has two years to run.
Palace representatives have, according to sources, been made aware of Arsenal's interest in Eze, who is open to the move.
Sources insist Palace would demand the full release clause should any club formalise their interest - but whether that stance softens towards the end of the window remains to be seen.
Chelsea winger Noni Madueke is another player Arsenal have considered - particularly given his versatility - but a move for the 23-year-old does not have universal backing at the club.
Who might Arsenal sell this summer?
BBC Sport understands Arsenal will look to sell one of their more established first-team players inside the next 12 months.
Winger Gabriel Martinelli has been extensively linked with a move away this summer, and it is understood that isn't something the club are ruling out.
Defender William Saliba is a long-term target for Real Madrid, but Arsenal are trying to extend the France international's contract.
If Arsenal do sign a new centre-back, Jakub Kiwior could be deemed surplus to requirements, and Oleksandr Zinchenko is available.
How Kai Havertz's role evolves in the next 12 months after the introduction of a new centre-forward will make for interesting viewing, too.
There are understood to be several clubs in Germany keeping a close eye on Havertz's situation heading into next summer, when he will have two years left on his contract.

The Northern Ireland Under-17 international made headlines in September 2022 when he became the youngest senior footballer in the United Kingdom at 13 years and 329 days old.
The teenager, who joined the Glenavon academy at four years old, broke the senior record when he came on as a second-half substitute for the Lurgan Blues during a 6-0 win over Dollingstown in the BetMcLean Cup.
Atherton beat the record set by Jordan Allan, who played for Airdrie aged 14 years and 191 days.
He was a first-team regular for Glenavon throughout the 2024-25 season, scoring his first Irish Premiership goal against Loughgall in March, as Paddy McLaughlin's side finished 10th in the table.
Glenavon announced his exit on X, with a post stating: ""Chris Atherton - blue still the colour.
""We can confirm that academy product Chris Atherton has left the club to sign for Chelsea We wish him the best in his career & hope he and his family won't be strangers at MVP.""
