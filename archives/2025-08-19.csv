Inspired by Liverpool? Man City's new approach explained,Man City's 4-0 win at Wolves showed they are up for a Premier League title chase - but the way they did it had Jamie Carragher wondering whether Pep Guardiola's fresh approach has been influenced by Liverpool.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13414302/liverpool-influence-at-man-city-jamie-carragher-explains-how-former-jurgen-klopp-assistant-pep-lijnders-may-be-impacting-pep-guardiola,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:23:00",Jamie Carragher,"['Liverpool', 'Manchester City']","Man City's 4-0 win at Wolves showed they are up for a Premier League title chase - but the way they did it had Jamie Carragher wondering whether Pep Guardiola's fresh approach has been influenced by Liverpool.
After City dropped off their usual standards last term, Guardiola brought in Pep Lijnders as assistant coach, Jurgen Klopp's former deputy at Liverpool.
With City playing an offside trap at Molineux and scoring on the counter-attack, Carragher believes Lijnders ""is having a big influence on Guardiola"", noting the similarities with the style Lijnders and Klopp favoured during their time together at Anfield.
Defensively, Man City repeatedly pushed up to try to catch Wolves offside - and did just that when Marshall Munetsi headed in during the first half. That plan was even executed close to the halfway line, with City's backline stepping right up high as Wolves tried to play the ball forwards.
""I couldn't believe what I saw, the players were all jumping high up to try and catch the Wolves players offside,"" said Carragher told Monday Night Football.
""This is very Liverpool-like. It made me think how much influence is maybe the new coach having on this team.""
Whether it was Liverpool-inspired or not, fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville applauded the performance of Man City's defence to keep such a disciplined line.
""It's really good play,"" he added. ""To get a back-four unit in sync like that, it takes some doing. It's really good play from [centre-back] John Stones.""
Carragher also noted similarities between City's performance with Liverpool's threat on the break under Klopp.
Tijjani Reijnders' goal came from a swift move up the field, with Guardiola making a point of celebrating with Lijnders in the aftermath.
""The amount of counter-attacking goals that Liverpool team would score with [Sadio] Mane and [Mohamed] Salah, breaking forward,"" said Carragher. ""When I looked at the goal from Reijnders… not maybe a Pep Guardiola goal.
""Of course, Pep Guardiola's teams have scored plenty of counter-attacking goals in the past. But what really stood out for this one was the type of goal it was. They win it and then they're off.
""Lijnders - Guardiola gives him the thanks, the hug. Now we don't know exactly what that's for, but I don't think it's a coincidence with some of the things that I saw in the game that he, as a coach, is having a big influence on Pep Guardiola.""
Afterwards, Guardiola himself said City were trying to be better with attacking breaks than they were last season.
""It's a weapon that we want to use this season - when we're getting the ball, attack quicker than maybe before.""
Whether it is a Liverpool inspiration from Lijnders or not, it seems clear Guardiola has once again reimagined his Man City side.
Carragher says the serial winner recognised the shift in style in the Premier League away from controlled, patient build-up into a more dynamic approach - and has responded.
""What Pep said last season, when he was talking about where the game was going, he was actually saying, 'it's not really my football', the football that was seen of teams in the Premier League. Transition, end-to-end football.
""I think he mentioned Brentford, he was talking about Bournemouth, he wasn't just talking about the real top teams. How many teams in the Premier League were playing like that.""
City have shown they can have success playing that way too. After learning from their rivals, they look like they will be serious contenders for the Premier League crown once again. That's a view shared by Neville.
""Watching that game on Saturday, it was a little bit, 'Oh, did we just forget about the obvious?' Pep Guardiola, if he loses a title, he'll win it back,"" said Neville.
""He wins titles nearly every single year he's coached in his career, and when you saw Reijnders on Saturday, you think of Rodri to come back in, you think of Stones and [Ruben] Dias, [Erling] Haaland up front... that's a spine and a half, that's a title-winning spine, it's a treble-winning spine with a manager who's prolific.
""City, just off what we've seen on Saturday, if they keep their players fit, they could be really in business.""

Frank's flexibility helping Spurs - and Man Utd's unusual numbers,,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13414076/thomas-franks-tottenham-are-flexible-nottingham-forest-change-it-up-and-man-utds-possession-in-the-debrief,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:08:00",Adam Bate,"['Manchester United', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Welcome to The Debrief, a Sky Sports column in which Adam Bate uses a blend of data and opinion to reflect on some of the key stories from the latest Premier League matches. This week:
Having been in Udine to see Tottenham come close to doing a number on Paris Saint-Germain, the question was whether or not they would be able to adjust their style of play three days later against Burnley. Thomas Frank answered that emphatically.
The passing of Guglielmo Vicario illustrated that most clearly in their 3-0 win on Saturday. Having directed the ball long against PSG, the Spurs goalkeeper switched the focus to ball retention against Burnley, attempting only two kicks over the halfway line.
In fact, Spurs as a side attempted the most passes inside their own half of any team on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. Frank pointed out afterwards that the move for Richarlison's second goal featured 17 passes - and included Vicario.
Richarlison impressed again and with 13 goals in his last 16 starts, is emerging once more as a robust alternative to Dominic Solanke. The Brazilian registered three shots on target inside the penalty box - equalling his record for any game in his Premier League career.
In midfield, Frank trusted two teenagers, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall, with Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha dropping to the bench. At the back, Kevin Danso, the new long-throw specialist, made way to accommodate Brennan Johnson - who duly scored.
It has been a promising start for Frank, particularly given that he had to manage those midweek exertions in Italy. His flexibility was a factor in his appointment, having been a persistent source of criticism for his predecessor and he got the balance right against Burnley.
Spurs not only created, scoring three against a side that did not even concede two in a single league game last season, but did so while keeping a clean sheet - their first in this competition since February and as many as in their previous 18 home games.
It is Manchester City away next, which will be as difficult as it gets. But Frank has already shown supporters that he is capable of setting this team up in whatever way that the match situation demands. Keep a close eye on Vicario's pass choices in that one.
A build-up attack is defined as a sequence in open play that contains 10 or more passes and ends either in a shot on goal or at least a touch inside the box. The team that did that the most times on the opening Premier League weekend was Nottingham Forest.
Nuno Espirito Santo's team did it seven times in their 3-1 win over Brentford, which is unusual because the most they managed in any game last season was just five. They ranked bottom but one in the Premier League for build-up attacks during that campaign.
Of course, it was a hugely successful season for Forest in which they came so close to securing Champions League football. But their style was built on containment without the ball and counter-attacking with it - they ranked top for the direct speed of their attacks.
There was still evidence of that in beating Brentford. Chris Wood's second goal came from a transition and it is clear that Forest will keep setting the traps that did for so many last year. But against Brentford there were also examples of clever pressing, of a possession game.
Forest completed 126 passes in the final third - the most of any Premier League team. After a pre-season in which Nuno complained about the lack of additions and one that featured no fewer than five goalless draws, maybe they have added some new aspects, after all.
That could prove important. Had Forest beaten Leicester at home - or indeed Brentford at the City Ground - towards the back end of last season, it could have been enough for a top-five finish. The manner of this performance suggests Nuno is out to address that.
Roy Keane may have bemoaned the erosion of standards that have led to Manchester United's home defeat to Arsenal being viewed as a positive step but the reality is that Ruben Amorim's side exceeded most expectations with their performance on Sunday.
It was not just that they caused one of the title favourites such problems but it was the way that they dominated the ball that surprised. Regardless of the game state, United have not done that against one of the top teams for a long time - and the stats back that up.
In Premier League matches against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City - last season's top four and the favourites to contend this time around - you have to go back almost a decade to find an example of United having 60 per cent of the possession.
All three examples since Sir Alex Ferguson left came under Louis van Gaal in 2015. If Amorim can begin to fuse the possession game of the Dutchman with the potent running power of new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha then there is hope.
Both Mbeumo and Cunha had chances to mark their Premier League debuts for the club with a goal. That they did not owes something to David Raya in the Arsenal goal and that dreaded phrase 'regression to the mean' that has been muttered about both men.
Mbeumo scored 20 goals for Brentford last season from an expected-goals tally of just 12.26. In every single game in which he had better chances than this last season, he scored. Remarkably, the same statistic was also true of Cunha. Rotten luck for United.
And yet, despite that disappointment, the overriding feeling is that if Amorim can keep getting the ball to his talented ball carriers in good areas then, whether it is Benjamin Sesko or Mason Mount up front with them, United will be a very different proposition this season.

Bournemouth sign Gannon Doak for £25m as Liverpool sales surpass £220m,Bournemouth have completed the signing of teenage winger Ben Gannon Doak from Liverpool for around &#163;25m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13414118/ben-gannon-doak-transfer-news-bournemouth-sign-winger-from-liverpool-in-a-deal-worth-up-to-25m,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:00:00",,['Liverpool'],"Bournemouth have completed the signing of teenage winger Ben Gannon Doak from Liverpool for around £25m.
Sky Sports News understands the deal for the 19-year-old includes a buy-back option, which was an essential condition for Liverpool to agree to the transfer.
The Scotland international, who wishes to be known as Gannon Doak to reflect both of his parents' names, has signed a five-year deal at the Vitality Stadium.
Sky Sports News understands Gannon Doak is viewed by Bournemouth as a replacement for Luis Sinisterra, who is set to join Brazilian side Cruzeiro on loan.
The south coast club sold forward Dango Ouattara to Brentford for £42.5m and they are looking at Bayer Leverkusen's Amine Adli and FC Midtjylland winger Dario Osorio as targets to replace Ouattara.
Meanwhile, Gannon Doak's sale means Liverpool have now sold eight players this summer for a combined total of £227.6m, having spent £321m on new signings.

Sky Sports News reported earlier in the window that Doak was seeking regular first-team football this season.
It is understood Porto had made a bid for Doak earlier this summer, with Stuttgart, Bologna and Monaco among the other European clubs eyeing a move for the teenager.
A host of Premier League clubs, including Nottingham Forest, West Ham, Leeds, Everton and Wolves, were also interested in the Scotland international this summer.
Liverpool rejected bids of around £20m from Crystal Palace and Ipswich in the January transfer window.
Doak spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, scoring three goals and adding seven assists in 24 Championship appearances before an injury in January cut his season short.

Gannon Doak could make his Bournemouth debut on Saturday at home in the Premier League against Wolves and he will wear the number 11 shirt.
He said: ""I'm buzzing to be here. I feel like it's the right time for me, and it's a great opportunity to play regular football at the highest level. It feels like the perfect fit.
""The team play very nice football. It's fast and it really suits my game, so I felt like I couldn't say no to the chance to play here.""
Gannon Doak is the Cherries’ fourth summer signing, taking the club's spending to just under £100m following the arrivals of goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, left-back Adrien Truffert and centre-back Bafode Diakite.

Tiago Pinto, the club's Head of Football Operations, said: ""Ben is an exciting young talent who has shown his quality at the highest level despite his age.
""﻿He brings pace and energy that will fit our model well, and we're thoroughly looking forward to helping him fulfil his potential at AFC Bournemouth.
""﻿We're pleased to bring another player into the club during this window as we continue to reinvest in the squad.""

From this season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Doak joins Bournemouth in £25m deal as Liverpool sales near £200m,Bournemouth sign Liverpool winger Ben Doak for an initial £20m with a further £5m in add-ons.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2vxp3e7gro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:35:19",Nizaar Kinsella,['Liverpool'],"Bournemouth have signed Liverpool winger Ben Doak for an initial £20m with a further £5m in add-ons.
The 19-year-old has signed a five-year contract and becomes Bournemouth's fourth summer acquisition.
Doak was left out of Liverpool's 4-2 win over Bournemouth at Anfield on Friday night.
""I'm buzzing to be here,"" Doak said.
""I feel like it's the right time for me and it's a great opportunity to play regular football at the highest level. It feels like the perfect fit.
""The team play very nice football. It's fast and it really suits my game, so I felt like I couldn't say no to the chance to play here.""
Doak has won six caps for Scotland and spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough in the Championship, scoring three times and recording seven assists in 24 matches.
Bournemouth are understood to have beaten interest from other Premier League clubs, including Leeds, as well as Portuguese side Porto.
Doak's move will give him a better chance of playing first-team football having featured just 10 times for Liverpool since joining from Celtic in 2022.
It takes Liverpool's sales to about £200m this summer, having spent more than £270m on new signings and a £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle.
Liverpool's major sales have included Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich in a £65.5m deal, Darwin Nunez to Al-Hilal for £46.3m and academy player Jarrell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.
Caoimhin Kelleher, Tyler Morton and Nat Phillips have also been sold, while the club received £8.4m from Real Madrid to release Trent Alexander-Arnold early from his contract, though the Spanish club dispute this figure.
The sale of Doak means Liverpool have brought in about £85m in initial fees for the winger, Phillips, Alexander-Arnold, Kelleher, Quansah and Morton. The six players arrived as either youth players or development projects and cost the Reds an initial £600,000. The subsequent profit for players classed as 'homegrown' gives the Reds an immediate boost in terms of current profit and sustainability rule (PSR) calculations.
Bournemouth have also had a busy summer having sold Dango Ouattara to Brentford for £42.5m last week.
They already lost defenders Illia Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez for a combined total of about £150m to Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid and Liverpool respectively.
Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said his side are ""not where they want to be"" before the defeat at Anfield and added ""important movements"" will be made before the transfer window closes on 1 September.
Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, left-back Adrien Truffert and centre-back Bafode Diakite have joined the club this summer, with January signing Eli Junior Kroupi also coming into the squad after finishing last season on loan at Lorient.
Sources say the Cherries are in the market for a further central defender and a striker to compete with Evanilson, with alternative option Enes Unal expected to be out with a major knee injury until November or December.
Doak showcased potential in loan spell - analysis
Noel Sliney, BBC Sport
Doak was regularly terrorising opposition full-backs for Middlesbrough in the Championship with his pace and direct style before a thigh injury ended his 2024-25 season in late January.
The winger, who made his senior Scotland debut last September, provided three goals and seven assists in 21 starts for Boro.
Among players to have featured in at least 20 Championship games last season, the 19-year-old ranked in the top six per 90 minutes for assists, chances created and touches in the opposition penalty area.

Amorim uses Ferguson tactic to defend Man Utd keeper call,Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim uses a tactic employed by legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson to defend his choice of goalkeeper.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx29yz0ezrjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:51:49",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Ruben Amorim was 55 seconds into a post-match news conference that lasted less than three and a half minutes at Old Trafford on Sunday when he was asked a question that made him flinch back and raise his eyebrows in disbelief.
It concerned his goalkeeper and whether he had given any consideration to picking veteran former England man Tom Heaton ahead of Altay Bayindir for the Premier League defeat by Arsenal.
""Why?"" came the response, the stare accompanying it unwavering.
What followed was the kind of exchange that used to be commonplace at Manchester United when Sir Alex Ferguson was the manager.
Essentially, journalists frequently asked questions that Ferguson either felt were genuinely ridiculous or that threatened to expose a weakness. Either, Ferguson reasoned, demanded a fierce rebuttal and a circling of the wagons.
""You are either with us, or against us,"" was Ferguson's mantra. The Scot viewed almost every journalist in the 'against us' camp, so he tended to treat their opinions with disdain, irrespective of their validity.
Amorim spoke to Ferguson just over a week ago, at the opening of United's revamped training ground. Whether tactics in dealing with the media were discussed is open to question.
But Amorim has certainly used this summer to try and create a tight bond with his squad, which lies behind how Sunday unfolded.
Events can change situations quickly when a transfer window is nearing its close and it has been established Andre Onana's former club Inter Milan are looking at bringing in a new goalkeeper. However, it is still the view of those at United on Monday there will be no additions to that part of their squad.
United chose to refresh their attacking positions with the finance that was available to the club this summer. When it became apparent Gianluigi Donnarumma was likely to be available as he is no longer required at Paris St-Germain, the word coming out of Old Trafford was the Italian goalkeeper would not be heading their way. That stance is not thought to have changed.
Picking Onana against Arsenal is bound to have come into Amorim's thinking. After all, it could not have been any clearer who his first choice was when the 29-year-old was picked for the Europa League final in May even though he had made high-profile mistakes in the build-up to the defeat by Tottenham in Bilbao.
However, while Amorim said in his pre-match news conference on Friday afternoon the Cameroon international was available to face Mikel Arteta's side, by kick-off, he had only three full training sessions behind him after suffering a hamstring injury early in July.
In Onana's absence, Amorim thought Bayindir had performed well during a summer campaign across three countries in which United remained unbeaten and the 27-year-old had featured in three and a half of the five games.
It was on that basis Amorim concluded in order for players to believe his 'group' philosophy, it would be the wrong decision to axe Bayindir, who in his eyes had done nothing to deserve it, for Onana, whose fitness had to be taken on trust.
That he chose to get on the front foot in his post-match news conference after his decision had been questioned seemed to be part of a wider strategy.
After all, if former England goalkeeper Joe Hart felt able to tell BBC Radio 5 Live that while he was initially minded to defend Bayindir, having seen a replay of the goal, he thought the player had made a mistake and could have used one hand to get William Saliba out of his way as he went to punch the ball with the other, it was fair to hold Amorim to account.
The former Sporting boss was forceful in his rebuttal: ""He suffered a goal like this where?"" he countered, when it was put to him Bayindir had conceded in similar manner - unable to deal with a set-piece superbly delivered under his crossbar – before.
When the game - a Carabao Cup tie at Tottenham last December when Son Heung-min scored direct from a corner - was mentioned, Amorim's reply was instant: ""Without VAR,"" he said. ""With VAR it is a foul.""
Amorim maintained his offensive by talking about Bayindir's next appearance, the FA Cup third-round tie at Arsenal a month later, when his goalkeeper was awarded man of the match in a shock penalty shootout win.
""You don't remember the game?"" Amorim said, without giving his inquisitor a chance to reply. ""I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable.""
And from that background Amorim made yesterday's call.
""I didn't drop Onana from the squad,"" he added. ""After just one week, without seeing a game, without training.""
Twice Amorim was then asked if he was happy with his three goalkeepers. He talked round the situation on the first occasion. When he was asked again, his reply confirming he was, was followed by a shake of the head, as if to say ""are you actually listening to me?""
Twenty seconds later, he had left.
Amorim is not due to speak to the media again until Friday, when it is almost guaranteed he will be asked who will be in goal against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday, and it is equally likely he will refuse to say.
Most expect Onana to get the call.
History suggests that selection is not without risk. Amorim will hope not to spend the aftermath of the game having to defend it.

Counter-attack Liverpool - what we learned from Premier League weekend,BBC Sport picks out five observations from the opening weekend of the new Premier League season.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gz40wvr1zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 13:18:26",Umir Irfan,['Liverpool'],"Another Premier League season has begun, with new-look sides, new-look tactical approaches and plenty of optimism (and pessimism!) among the fans.
We could have picked out many observations across all teams - but here are five that caught our eye in particular at the weekend.
1. Liverpool look weak against counter-attacks
Arne Slot's Liverpool have brought in attacking reinforcements but the balance of their side looks off. Against Bournemouth, they were bright going forward but looked susceptible to conceding on the break.
Last season, Liverpool only conceded two goals from fast breaks all season. In the first game of this season, they equalled that number.
So what has changed for Liverpool?
The personnel informs how tactics are executed and Slot pointed towards sloppy passing in midfield as a reason Liverpool were so exposed. These misplaced passes gave the opposition time and space against a disorganised defensive shape while attacking the centre of the pitch.
This is more dangerous than losing the ball in the wide areas as attackers are closer to goal, in better shooting positions.
Although Slot focuses mainly on the sloppy passing and dispossessions in midfield, it is objectively true that Liverpool committed many bodies to their attack. At times, there were seven or eight players in and around Bournemouth's box, leaving Liverpool with very few players back to defend.
For Antoine Semenyo's second goal, both Joe Gomez and Andy Robertson were attacking in the opposition's box so were unable to get back to defend the counter-attack when the ball was lost.
Yes, decision-making and passing quality needs to be better but Slot may need to tweak the positions of the full-backs or central midfielders when Liverpool are attacking for additional protection against dangerous counter-attacking sides.
2. Man City look like they are back

Many people consider Man City as outsiders in the title race – only five of our 33 pundits predict them lifting the trophy in May – but their impressive 4-0 win at Wolves means that they've now taken 43 points from their 20 games in 2025 - more than any other side.
Rodri's season-ending injury last September clearly derailed their Premier League campaign but rather than simply awaiting his return, Pep Guardiola has found a solution without him and the former champions have been getting back on track since the start of the year.
Below is Man City's 'non-penalty expected goal difference per game' (that's a mouthful) since the start of last season, which tells us how much a team dominates their games by creating lots of good chances and limiting their opponents to few, bad ones.
It's the X-ray stat, the one that shows how good teams are before hot finishing streaks and the rub of the green come into play.
As we can see, Man City are now almost dominating games to the level they were before the Ballon d'Or winner's injury.
Anyone writing them off does so at their peril.

3. Still no magic spark from Potter at West Ham
It's fair to say that Graham Potter has not had the impact many expected when he replaced Julen Lopetegui as West Ham manager in January, with the 3-0 defeat by Sunderland on Saturday their ninth defeat in 19 Premier League games under him.
In fact, he now needs to orchestrate a win over his former club Chelsea at home on Friday night simply to match Lopetegui's Premier League record before he was sacked after 20 games in charge.
Potter has noticeably improved the defence that he inherited, with the Hammers conceding 13 fewer goals and 69 fewer shots than they did under the Spaniard (although those stats will be slightly worse after the Chelsea game).
However, that defensive improvement has come at a significant cost to the attack. While they've only scored two goals fewer (with a game to play), West Ham's shot and expected goal numbers have deteriorated dramatically.
The big improvement in their goal difference would suggest they've perhaps been a bit unlucky in terms of results, but their xG difference shows that Potter has improved them only slightly overall and is yet to really work his magic on West Ham.
4. Frank's clever kick-off routine
Thomas Frank's Tottenham have adopted many of the same principles we saw work for Brentford last season and the novel use of dead-ball situations is one. Of particular note this weekend was the use of the kick-off as a set-piece routine.
Against Burnley, the ball was passed back to Guglielmo Vicario from kick-off as the home team shuffled up the pitch. Burnley logically shuffled deeper, pre-empting a long ball. The deceptive nature of how Vicario shaped up sold this routine further before a shorter pass to Pedro Porro was played.
By finding Porro towards the inner right side of the pitch, closer to goal, the angle he could play the cross at was more likely to result in a dangerous chance. Porro is one of Spurs' strongest crossers and with Spurs getting an extra body at the back post, on another occasion this may have resulted in an early goal.
By manufacturing a situation in which the ball is launched long early has the added benefit of getting the ball away from your own goal so pressure from the opposition can't be applied.
Frank's sides aim to maximise fine-margin gains across the pitch and the focus on a smart, well-worked kick-off routine is another tool in their expansive skillset. Across this season, they will certainly continue to experiment with their kick-off routines.

5. Arsenal trying to be more direct: The Good, the Bad & the Ugly
Mikel Arteta's Arsenal have taken an alternative approach to their recent summer transfer business. For a team who have dominated the ball, playing slowly and methodically for the last few seasons, they have now looked to introduce directness and counter-attacking threat.
Against Manchester United, Arsenal played more directly and it was to their detriment on the day. We saw numerous quick attacks consisting of players carrying the ball quickly upfield over large distances before trying to play through balls for the attackers. In seasons gone by, they would've likely opted to hold the ball, passing it backwards before restarting their attack.
Martin Odegaard was primarily the player leading the majority of counter-attacks. Viktor Gyokeres' best attacking zones are in the inside right channel. As the Swede darted in behind, Odegaard's weight of pass was off and chances broke down. This made the game end-to-end, suiting United's quick attackers.
Odegaard being left footed here was slightly problematic too. Angle-wise, using a right-footed player would allow the pass to go towards the goal rather than curling away from it, making it easier for someone like Gyokeres to shoot early. Imagine Kevin de Bruyne's through balls (from right central midfield) to Erling Haaland if you're struggling to understand what I mean.
Although this style of play was ineffective in the opening game, there are positives. If Arsenal can get the final pass correct, they'll find themselves in clear goalscoring opportunities more often. How Arsenal balance their slower possession style with this newer, transitional quality will be an important thread to their season.

Spurs captain Romero signs new four-year contract,Tottenham captain Cristian Romero signs a new four-year contract to commit his future to the club.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjdyj4m9v0go?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:40:38",Sam Drury,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero has signed a new four-year contract to commit his future to the club.
The 27-year-old Argentina centre-back joined Spurs from Atalanta in August 2021, initially on loan before the move was made permanent the following summer.
He has made 126 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals, and captained the side in the Europa League final as Tottenham beat Manchester United to end their 17-year wait for a trophy.
After being heavily linked with a move to Atletico Madrid over the summer, Romero was named club captain by new head coach Thomas Frank and the deal ensures he will remain under contract in north London until 2029.
Romero said he was ""very happy"" at Spurs and after helping them win the Europa League in the previous campaign has predicted a ""special season"" ahead for the club.
""We want to win. Maybe why not win again this season? Another trophy with the club is important for everyone,"" Romero explained.
""For me this club is the best in the world. The last two weeks, first [being appointed] captain and now signing the contract with the club - for me it's a fantastic decision.""
Frank said last week that Romero was a player who commands ""big respect"" from his team-mates and ""sets the standards"" on and off the pitch.
""What I like about him and why I have chosen him as captain is his leadership qualities,"" said the Spurs boss.
""The staff have said to me they've never seen him train that well. He's in a very good place. I see a player that will want to lead the team and push the team.""
The former Belgrano defender, who had two years left on his previous deal, follows right-back Djed Spence in signing a new long-term contract.
Spence, 25, arrived from Middlesbrough in 2022 but endured a difficult start to his Spurs career and had loan spells at Rennes, Leeds and Genoa.
Last season he emerged as an important player for former boss Ange Postecoglou and has made 42 appearances, scoring twice.
Spence's existing deal had been set to expire in 2028.

The Denmark forward was left out of the matchday squad for United's 1-0 home defeat by Arsenal on Sunday.
It is understood coach Ruben Amorim took the decision amid intense speculation over the 22-year-old's future.
While Hojlund has previously expressed a strong desire to remain at United, the arrival of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for £73.7m means his opportunities are likely to be severely restricted.
""Hojlund is a good option for us,"" Tare told Sport Mediaset, external before Sunday's 2-0 win over Bari in the Coppa Italia.
""We are evaluating him these days, but the transfer market is unpredictable.
""We know that we have to intervene in that position and we also know that they must be players who can give something more to this group.""
He also confirmed interest in Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic.
Hojlund was left on the bench for the final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina on 9 August, even though Sesko's only involvement was to be paraded before kick-off as Mason Mount occupied a false nine slot.
Mount started in that role on Sunday, with Sesko and fellow striker Joshua Zirkzee on the bench.
Sesko came on to make his debut with 25 minutes remaining.
""It is a fight for places,"" Amorim said after the defeat.
""We'll see what is going to happen in the market. There are different characteristics. Rasmus has the same characteristics of Benjamin Sesko, so we need to choose.""
Hojlund, who joined for £72m two years ago, was United's main striker last season and scored 10 goals in 52 games.
His debut campaign brought 16 goals after his move from Italian side Atalanta.
The move to drop Hojlund has been backed by United's leadership.
Amorim has spent £200m on a completely revamped forward line, with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha set to fill the two number 10 slots Amorim prefers.
In addition to Mount, England international Kobbie Mainoo could also play as a false nine - while Bruno Fernandes did the job successfully in the 2024 FA Cup final.
On United's pre-season tour of the United States, Cunha filled the number nine role - although he also tended to drop deeper.
Seventeen-year-old Chido Obi featured for the first team at the end of last season, although at his stage of his development it is thought unlikely he would be regarded as a regular stater, with his involvement is more likely as a substitute.

Scotland winger Doak joins Bournemouth from Liverpool for £25m,Bournemouth sign Liverpool winger Ben Doak for an initial £20m with a further £5m in add-ons.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2vxp3e7gro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:35:19",Nizaar Kinsella,['Liverpool'],"Bournemouth have signed Liverpool winger Ben Doak for an initial £20m with a further £5m in add-ons.
The 19-year-old has signed a five-year contract and becomes Bournemouth's fourth summer acquisition.
Doak was left out of Liverpool's 4-2 win over Bournemouth at Anfield on Friday night.
""I'm buzzing to be here,"" Doak said.
""I feel like it's the right time for me and it's a great opportunity to play regular football at the highest level. It feels like the perfect fit.
""The team play very nice football. It's fast and it really suits my game, so I felt like I couldn't say no to the chance to play here.""
Doak has won six caps for Scotland and spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough in the Championship, scoring three times and recording seven assists in 24 matches.
Bournemouth are understood to have beaten interest from other Premier League clubs, including Leeds, as well as Portuguese side Porto.
Doak's move will give him a better chance of playing first-team football having featured just 10 times for Liverpool since joining from Celtic in 2022.
It takes Liverpool's sales to about £200m this summer, having spent more than £270m on new signings and a £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle.
Liverpool's major sales have included Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich in a £65.5m deal, Darwin Nunez to Al-Hilal for £46.3m and academy player Jarrell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.
Caoimhin Kelleher, Tyler Morton and Nat Phillips have also been sold, while the club received £8.4m from Real Madrid to release Trent Alexander-Arnold early from his contract, though the Spanish club dispute this figure.
The sale of Doak means Liverpool have brought in about £85m in initial fees for the winger, Phillips, Alexander-Arnold, Kelleher, Quansah and Morton. The six players arrived as either youth players or development projects and cost the Reds an initial £600,000. The subsequent profit for players classed as 'homegrown' gives the Reds an immediate boost in terms of current profit and sustainability rule (PSR) calculations.
Bournemouth have also had a busy summer having sold Dango Ouattara to Brentford for £42.5m last week.
They already lost defenders Illia Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez for a combined total of about £150m to Paris St-Germain, Real Madrid and Liverpool respectively.
Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said his side are ""not where they want to be"" before the defeat at Anfield and added ""important movements"" will be made before the transfer window closes on 1 September.
Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, left-back Adrien Truffert and centre-back Bafode Diakite have joined the club this summer, with January signing Eli Junior Kroupi also coming into the squad after finishing last season on loan at Lorient.
Sources say the Cherries are in the market for a further central defender and a striker to compete with Evanilson, with alternative option Enes Unal expected to be out with a major knee injury until November or December.
Doak showcased potential in loan spell - analysis
Noel Sliney, BBC Sport
Doak was regularly terrorising opposition full-backs for Middlesbrough in the Championship with his pace and direct style before a thigh injury ended his 2024-25 season in late January.
The winger, who made his senior Scotland debut last September, provided three goals and seven assists in 21 starts for Boro.
Among players to have featured in at least 20 Championship games last season, the 19-year-old ranked in the top six per 90 minutes for assists, chances created and touches in the opposition penalty area.

Tottenham close in on signing Crystal Palace attacker Eberechi Eze,Palace want replacement lined up before sale,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/18/eberechi-eze-tottenham-crystal-palace-cristian-romero,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:45:28",David Hytner,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have stepped up their pursuit of Eberechi Eze by holding further talks regarding signing the England forward, but Crystal Palace want to line up a replacement before sanctioning his sale.
Spurs, who confirmed contract extensions for their new captain, Cristian Romero, on Monday, are longstanding admirers of Eze, having made a move for him last summer. They are even keener to get him now that James Maddison is out with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture. Dejan Kulusevski, another of the club’s key attacking midfielders, is out with a knee problem.
Eze is represented by the influential CAA Base agency, which has close links to Spurs, and he is open to the transfer. The 27-year-old forward has also been tracked by Arsenal, the club he supported as a boy and played for during his formative years.
Eze’s contract at Palace contained a £68m release clause but it expired last Friday. Spurs hope to get him for around £55m plus bonuses. Eze’s previous club, Queens Park Rangers, are entitled to 15% of any profits that Palace make on him. Palace paid around £19m to QPR for the player in August 2020.
Romero has re-signed at Spurs until 2029 and it represents something of a turnaround for him after he was linked with a move away at the start of the summer. The Argentina centre-half has made no secret of his ambition to one day play in Spain and he was of interest to Atlético Madrid. But having been given the Spurs captaincy after the departure of Son Heung-min to Los Angeles FC, the 27-year-old has re-emphasised his commitment. The right-back Djed Spence has also signed a new long-term contract with the club.
Palace, meanwhile, have targeted Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss and Christos Tzolis of Club Bruges as potential replacements for Eze. The club are believed to have failed with an initial offer of £20m for El Khannouss, whose release clause expired at the weekend, with Leicester thought to want around £26m for the Morocco forward. Palace have also made an offer of £25m for Tzolis, a Greece international who spent three seasons at Norwich.
Oliver Glasner said he expected Eze to play for Palace in the Conference League playoff first leg against Fredrikstad at Selhurst Park on Thursday. If he did, he would still be able to play for another team in the league phase of European competition this season.
Marc Guéhi is also expected to feature on Thursday as Liverpool have yet to match Palace’s £40m valuation of the England defender, whose contract expires at the end of the season. Guéhi is understood to be willing to stay at Selhurst Park and leave on a free transfer although the Palace chair, Steve Parish, has admitted that he would prefer to sell the 25-year-old this month.
Palace had considered the Sporting defender Ousmane Diomande as a potential replacement for Guéhi but the 21-year-old is expected to be out for six weeks with a muscle injury and is unlikely to move this window.
Palace have also shown an interest in Jakub Kiwior but the Poland defender is believed to prefer to move overseas having been left out of Arsenal’s squad for the game against Manchester United on Sunday. Porto are in talks over a season-long loan for Kiwior with an obligation to make the move permanent at the end of the season.

Manchester United’s opening defeat throws up more questions than answers,The loss to Arsenal at Old Trafford underlined the scale of the task facing Ruben Amorim as his first full season begins,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/18/manchester-united-rubin-amorim-bryan-mbeumo-matheus-cunha-benjamin-sesko,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:30:02",Jamie Jackson,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Points the whole point?
A great appeal of football is the myriad pub and parlour opinions any game conjures. In the wake of Manchester United’s 1-0 defeat against Arsenal on Sunday, social media lit-up with differing takes from those of a United persuasion. The case for optimism featured United’s 22 shots to Arsenal’s eight and the beginnings of what may flower into an on-field bromance between Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. The case for pessimism: a crisis at No 1, with Altay Bayindir’s timidness leading to Riccardo Calafiori’s winner and André Onana’s ongoing flakiness. Then there is the bottom line: United were defeated. As midfielder Casemiro said afterwards: “I’m not going to say that losing is OK; we have to win. Manchester United always has to win. I think we have shown good moments, and we have played much better, but we have to look for the victory.”
Everything but the goal
Within a few seconds of the game on Sunday, Mbeumo charged down the right wing and then picked out Cunha after hearing the yells of his fellow No 10. Here, then, was a glimpse of how the new boys may gel beyond the weekend, which would have been heartening to see for all United fans. Mbeumo’s skillset features a killer touch, a cut-throat running ability, a calibrated pass radar and an eye for a shot. Cunha has the same abilities as well as a tendency to purr past opponents, as he did in one game-breaking run during the first half. And operating as a No 9, the Brazilian also showed he can be a differing option in that position to Benjamin Sesko. Yet neither Mbeumo or Cunha scored, spurning a slew of chances. This has to be fixed.
Sesko needs fast start
Sesko arrived at Old Trafford on a £73.7m ticket of being a tall, awkward, skilful, fast No 9 and, in a 25-minute debut on Sunday after coming on as a substitute, the Slovenian offered glimpses of those traits. But, as is the case with Mbeumo and Cunha, the heat is on the 22-year-old to tear up defences and stick the ball in the net. United managed a paltry 44 Premier League goals last season and if Ruben Amorim cannot get more out of his newly-established attack then the head coach will be the latest to have his career sucked into an Old Trafford-shaped black hole. Sesko needs to start at Fulham on Sunday and be allowed to show he has what it takes to lead the line for Amorim’s side.
Managing expectations
All No 1s are a few bad games away from pressure but in the fevered hothouse of United, scrutiny is a 24-7 occupation. Amorim has spent £200m-plus on Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko, is in the market for a new No 6 and goalkeeper, and has had since early November to implement his ideas. Oh, and there is no European football, meaning more time on the training ground. What, then, is a reasonable expectation from Amorim’s United this season? No one should expect them to mount a top-four challenge, but a return to continental competition seems a reasonable expectation via an upturn in performance, meaning discernible patterns of attractive and controlled front-foot play. The United results graph for last season read 11 wins and 18 defeats for 42 points, and a goal difference of -10 and a 15th-place finish. This has to be reversed.
Six appeal
Amorim continuing to select Casemiro ahead of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo is a red flag regarding the weakness of United’s midfield department. The player, himself, is content. “I am very happy here,” he told manutd.com. “My family is happy here. I enjoy every day at Carrington [the training base] and at Old Trafford. If people talk from the outside, that’s fine, it doesn’t interest me. I just want to focus on winning.” To have a man with five Champions Leagues on the CV is a boon for Amorim as he aims to pull off what proved a sisyphean task for David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Erik ten Hag: to make United great again. And if a No 6 can be recruited before the close of the transfer window, then Casemiro can be eased back to the bench where his experience and professionalism can continue to influence teammates.

"Arsenal’s win at Manchester United may not have impressed, but it was just what they need","Winning at Old Trafford may not prove to be as common as last season, making Arsenal’s result stand out among the title hopefuls",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/18/arsenals-win-at-manchester-united-may-not-have-impressed-but-it-was-just-what-they-need,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:40:51",Jonathan Wilson,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","There was a thought at times in the second part of last season, when the set-piece goals dried up, that Arsenal had become over-reliant on them. And perhaps that was true, but they’re a useful weapon to have. Some games are won by overwhelming opponents through superior technical ability and some games are won by organization and hard work, by finding a way to score and a way to keep their opponent out. Arsenal’s 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Sunday was definitely one of the latter.
Manchester United do not defend inswinging corners well. Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka both excel at taking inswinging corners. In that sense, the fact that the game was decided by United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir’s flap at a Rice inswinger was entirely to be expected. What was less predictable was the nature of the game that followed as United hit the post and David Raya was called into seven saves. Mikel Arteta, quite reasonably, praised his side’s “character and spirit” while acknowledging they had made “mistakes that are very far from the standards that we normally have.”

Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer
It’s not that Arsenal were fortunate or that they somehow didn’t deserve to win, if that is a concept with any meaning; rather it was the thought that against a more coherent or incisive side than United, they will need to play rather better. Winning without playing well, though, has not often been the Arsenal way recently; in that sense, there was perhaps encouragement to be drawn from the hard-earned nature of the three points.
That they will surely do. A certain rustiness in the opening game is only natural, particularly with new players to integrate. Viktor Gyökeres will adjust at least to an extent to the pace of the game. Martin Zubimendi looked appalled that the swinging arm with which Bryan Mbeumo caught him early on wasn’t penalized, but he will surely learn to handle the knocks and bumps and flailing limbs of English football. Arteta acknowledged it would take both time to get up to speed but pronounced himself satisfied with how they had played. The “mistakes” will be ironed out. A degree of fluency will return.
But until then, it’s good to have the set-plays. Arsenal have scored 31 times from corners since the beginning of the 2023-24 season, at least 11 more than any other side in the Premier League. That’s a valuable weapon to have, particularly for a team that has so regularly been criticized for having to dominate a game to win it. In that sense, the win at Old Trafford was a little like Arsenal’s victory over Aston Villa in their first away game of last season, a game chiefly notable for an extraordinary double save from Raya. Praise them for getting the result without playing especially well, for showing what in hindsight might be regarded as the grit of champions, or question why they didn’t play especially well? The answer to that will only become apparent as the season goes on.
Arsenal, though, probably can take comfort and more than a degree of satisfaction from having beaten United away. True, nine sides did that last season, but Ruben Amorim’s side surely won’t be as bad this campaign as they were then. Old Trafford may again become a difficult place to go, as United’s squad settles and the impact of not having to play European football comes to be felt; having got the game against them out of the way early may end up being fortunate.
Of the four realistic title contenders, Arsenal had the hardest start and without excelling have three points on the board, which is more than can be said of Chelsea after their 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace. The world champions have a hugely gifted squad, particularly in forward areas but, with Benoît Badiashile, Wesley Fofana and Levi Colwill all suffering long-term injuries, look a little short at the back, while doubts persist about Robert Sánchez. The goalkeeper was perhaps fortunate that VAR ruled out Eberechi Eze’s free kick that flew past him, but the bigger issue on Sunday was the lack of creativity. Upgrading from Nicolas Jackson at centre-forward has not proved an instant panacea.
Manchester City were the most impressive of the contenders on opening weekend, with the new signing in midfield Tijjani Reijnders starring in the 4-0 win at Wolves. Given the sort of space Wolves afforded them, they will cut teams apart but the openness they exhibited at times last season and again in the Club World Cup has not gone away; better sides than Wolves may be able to exploit that. Liverpool looked at least as open in their 4-2 win over Bournemouth and, like Arsenal, were left grateful for their resilience as they scored twice after the 88th minute to secure the three points. They too have work to do in balancing the side and integrating new signings.
None of the probable top four were at anything like their best. All will find a greater cohesion as the season goes on. But Arsenal have got one of the trickier away games out of the way.

Man arrested over alleged racist abuse of Antoine Semenyo released on bail,Ghana forward reported abuse during game at Anfield,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/18/liverpool-man-banned-attending-matches-bournemouth-antoine-semenyo-abuse,"Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:15:46",Soccer,['Liverpool'],"A 47-year-old man from Liverpool who was arrested on suspicion of racially abusing the Bournemouth player Antoine Semenyo has been conditionally bailed and banned from attending matches, Merseyside police said on Monday.
The Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth at Anfield on Friday was halted during the first half after Semenyo told the referee he was targeted by a man in the crowd. The Ghana forward scored twice in the second half, but Liverpool won the match 4-2.
Police said a man had been ejected from Anfield over the incident and announced they had made an arrest the following day. “He has now been bailed with conditions, which includes not to attend any regulated football match in the UK and not to go within one mile of a designated football stadium,” Merseyside police said, adding that the investigation was still ongoing.
The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, condemned the racist abuse directed at Semenyo, saying that the Players’ Voice Panel would aid the 25-year-old. On Saturday, Semenyo thanked his teammates, Liverpool, match officials and the “entire football family” for their support.
