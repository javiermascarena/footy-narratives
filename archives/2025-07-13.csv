Arsenal target Gyokeres to face disciplinary action at Sporting,Sporting president Frederico Varandas has confirmed that striker Viktor Gyokeres will face disciplinary proceedings at the club after failing to turn up to training on Saturday.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13395941/viktor-gyokeres-transfer-sporting-president-confirms-forward-to-face-disciplinary-action-after-missing-training-amid-arsenal-interest,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 19:45:00",,['Arsenal'],"Sporting president Frederico Varandas has confirmed that striker Viktor Gyokeres will face disciplinary proceedings at the club after failing to turn up to training on Saturday.
Gyokeres was due back for pre-season training on July 12, after the club gave him permission to delay his return.
Arsenal have been in talks to sign the 27-year-old, but have so far failed to come to an agreement on a £69m deal.
Varandas said: ""We're calm. Everything can be solved with the closure of the market, a hefty fine and an apology to the group.
""If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we'll be very comfortable with that for the next three years.
""If the geniuses who are devising this strategy think that this puts pressure on me to make it easier for him to leave, not only are they completely wrong, but they are also making it more complicated for the player to leave.
""No one is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are.""
Sporting are believed to want an initial fee of £60.4m, plus £8.6m in add-ons.
After joining Sporting from Coventry for around £20m in 2023, Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 matches during his two seasons in Portugal.
Gyokeres hit 54 goals in 52 games in all competitions during the last campaign, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, as he helped Sporting win the league and the Portuguese Cup.
A move to Arsenal would see Gyokeres return to English football, having joined Brighton in January 2018 before moving to Coventry after loan spells at St Pauli and Swansea.
Gyokeres scored 43 goals for Coventry in his two and a half seasons at the Championship side.
Talks continue between Arsenal and Sporting over the signing of Gyokeres but a gap in the valuation of the striker remains between the two clubs.
While the clubs aren't too far away from a compromise on an overall fee, it's thought how much of that fee will be guaranteed is key.
Arsenal are understood to be encouraged and impressed with the player's desire to join, but they will be disciplined in their approach.
They have done due diligence on other targets if a deal cannot be struck with Sporting.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Arsenal target Gyokeres faces Sporting disciplinary action,"Sporting president says striker Viktor Gyokeres is facing disciplinary action after he did not report for pre-season training with his potential transfer away from the Portuguese club becoming ""more complicated"".",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj4e02gqz8lo,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 08:06:51",Sami Mokbel,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal target Viktor Gyokeres is facing disciplinary action by his club Sporting after failing to report for pre-season training, says the Portuguese club's president Frederico Varandas.
Varandas added that any potential transfer was now becoming ""more complicated"".
BBC Sport reported last week that Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta held face-to-face talks with Sweden international Gyokeres in Portugal.
Sources have told BBC Sport that talks are ongoing with Arsenal, who are still hopeful of striking a deal, with their most recent proposal for the 27-year-old  totalling about 70m euros (£60m) including add-ons.
Last month Sporting president Varandas said there was no 'gentleman's agreement' for Gyokeres to leave for 70m euros but added that the club would not demand his full release clause of 100m euros (£85m).
Gyokeres, who scored 54 goals in 52 games last season, has yet to publicly explain why he has not turned up for pre-season.
Varandas told Portuguese news agency Lusa that ""no one is above the interests of the club"".
""We're calm. Everything can be solved with the closure of the market, a hefty fine and an apology to the group,"" Varandas said.

Has run to Club World Cup final been worth it for Chelsea?,Has Chelsea's run to the Club World Cup final made the competition worthwhile for the Blues? BBC Sport weighs up the pros and cons.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgrx1ezk7elo,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 14:00:39",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Whatever happens in Sunday's final, Chelsea will be walking away from the Club World Cup with more than 10% of the total $1bn (£740.5m) prize pot set aside by Fifa.
Given their already lavish summer spending, it is money not to be sniffed at.
But the competition, which will reach its conclusion when the Blues face Paris St-Germain in New Jersey, has been about more than just the vast riches on offer for Enzo Maresca's side.
It represents an opportunity to add a second trophy in as many months after their Conference League triumph in June, further dampening criticism of the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital project built around signing young players on long contracts.
It's also a chance to say they are world champions - at least until the next tournament is held in 2029.
Chelsea have put significant work in getting this far, with potential injuries to contend with and a shorter pre-season before the Premier League season begins on 16 August.
BBC Sport weighs up the pros and cons of the Club World Cup to the club.
What's it been like off the pitch?
Chelsea's non-international players had a 10-day break after winning the Conference League final, but others came into the competition after representing their national sides just a week earlier.
They had a four-day stint training at Cobham before flying into Atlanta for a match against Los Angeles FC, before basing themselves in Philadelphia for the majority of the group stage.
They moved on to Miami, before settling in New York for the semi-final and final - the travelling has been vast.
But there was one constant in the United States - it was hot everywhere and impacted Chelsea's ability to train. And, while the club has coped admirably and found ways to win, keeping players happy has been another challenge.
A large amount of freedom has been afforded to the players by manager Maresca to enjoy their downtime in the various US cities, while also expecting a high degree of professionalism.
Players have been able to meet friends and family, especially from the knockout stages onwards, and it has kept many happier than might have been the case.
The Blues also smartly drafted in Football Association (FA) staff to help organise the camps behind the scenes, including entertainment and accommodation for the families of the players.
Building relationships on the pitch
With pre-season now set to be cut significantly, Maresca has used the competition to experiment with a new system.
Against Flamengo he switched to a formation utilising more traditional full-backs and with Cole Palmer playing as an inverted winger, just as he did under previous boss Mauricio Pochettino.
That ended in a disappointing 3-1 defeat and attracted criticism, although they did bounce back with a 4-1 extra-time last-16 success over Benfica using a similar system.
Maresca has also used more of his squad than any other club at the tournament in 27, with every outfield player taken to the US getting some time on the pitch.
New signings Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Dario Essugo and Mamadou Sarr have made their debuts - along with Andrey Santos and Aaron Anselmino, who were already at the club - and some of them have spoken about how the nature of the long overseas trip has helped them assimilate with their new team-mates.
Delap said ""100%"" when asked about this, adding: ""Settling into any new place, it is always helpful spending 24/7 with everyone.
""It has really helped me get to know everyone.""
Forwards Delap and Joao Pedro have both hit the ground running too after their arrivals from Ipswich Town and Brighton.
But the transfer window has been a double-edged sword with Noni Madueke, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku and Trevoh Chalobah among the players being linked with moves.
Madueke, who has agreed personal terms with Arsenal while Chelsea hold out for a £50m fee, continues to be involved from the bench.
'No pressure' over financial incentives
Much has been made about the vast riches at the extended Club World Cup - and Chelsea are closing in on the jackpot.
Their semi-final win over Brazilian side Fluminense took their total to about £80m, although Fifa have not confirmed their exact participation fee.
On top of the £21.9m for reaching the final, the Blues will claim another £7.3m if they lift the trophy.
Joao Pedro, a £60m signing from Brighton, repaid about a third of his transfer fee with his two debut goals against Fluminense.
But Chelsea's total prize money at the tournament will be more than enough to pay for his transfer, with a bit more left over going towards the £30m signing of Delap.
It will also help fund the £29m for Palmeiras winger Estevao Willian - who joins them after the Club World Cup - while £48.5m Jamie Gittens was another expensive arrival.
But before their final group game against ES Tunis, Maresca said: ""The owners just want the best for us and for the players game by game, and they are not talking about the final prize or the final reward in terms of money.
""They never put pressure on me or the players in terms of we need to win this tournament because of the money.""
Physical toll but Blues benefit
Maresca says his players will receive three weeks of holiday after the Club World Cup finishes - and confirmed there will be no trophy parade even if they beat PSG.
Many will jet off to the Caribbean or the west coast of the US on holiday directly from New York after Sunday's showpiece.
But there will remain questions about the physical cost of this competition, which has led Chelsea to playing 64 matches in a 53-week season.
Essugo, Benoit Badiashile, Romeo Lavia and Moises Caciedo were among those to pick up injuries in the US.
Chelsea, however, had the luxury of being able to heavily rotate their squad in competitions last season.
And there is a feeling that, despite the concerns about the Club World Cup, they have benefited both on and off the pitch.
What are their pre-season plans?
Chelsea players are expected to have at least one week less holiday than fellow Club World Cup participants Manchester City.
They will face Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan at Stamford Bridge in a mini-tournament on 8 and 10 August.
There is limited time to fit in any further fixtures, with less than two weeks from when the players return to training and their Premier League opener against Crystal Palace on 17 August.

Ex-England striker Carroll joins Dagenham & Redbridge,"Former Newcastle, Liverpool and West Ham striker Andy Carroll joins sixth-tier Dagenham & Redbridge on a free transfer.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62dkdexrp5o,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 21:23:10",Tim Abraham,['Liverpool'],"Former Newcastle, Liverpool and West Ham striker Andy Carroll has joined sixth-tier Dagenham & Redbridge on a free transfer.
Carroll has signed a reported three-year deal with the National League South club after leaving Bordeaux last month.
The 36-year-old departed the French fourth-tier club after just a season because he wanted to be closer to his children.
Carroll said in an interview with Sky Sports, external that he had ""clubs ringing me up from higher leagues"" but it was important that he moved to a team which was the ""right fit"".
""It doesn't matter the level, or anything, as long as I get on the pitch and play football, that's all that matters,"" Carroll said.
""Coming here and showing people I am just playing for the love of football rather than the money and the level is something I wanted to do.
""This is something which could be fantastic. We have a project to get them out of non-league and back up the leagues.""
Gateshead-born Carroll scored 54 goals in 248 Premier League games during spells with Newcastle United, Liverpool and West Ham United.
He then went on to play for Reading and West Bromwich Albion before moving to France with second-tier side Amiens in 2023.
Carroll won nine caps for England, scoring two goals, between 2010 and 2012.
On the day they signed Carroll, Dagenham & Redbridge also announced a deal to sell the club to a consortium of private investors from Qatar.
The Daggers were bought by Club Underdog, a subsidiary of US-based company North Six Group, in May 2024.
""Completion of the transaction remains subject to legal finalisation and approvals from the FA and the National League,"" Dagenham & Redbridge said in a statement.

Ex-Man Utd boss Van Gaal 'no longer bothered by cancer',"The former Netherlands and Manchester United boss says he is ""getting fitter and fitter"" after successful treatment.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgq7k1wgv5jo,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 13:24:00",Ben Collins,['Manchester United'],"Former Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal has said he is ""no longer bothered by cancer"" after successful treatment.
The 73-year-old announced in 2022, during his third spell as coach of the Dutch national team, that he was receiving treatment for prostate cancer.
The ex-Manchester United manager left the Netherlands role after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and has since served as a special advisor to Ajax, who he led to a Champions League triumph in 1995.
But during an appearance on Humberto, the same Dutch TV talk show on which he revealed his illness, Van Gaal said on Friday: ""I'm no longer bothered by cancer. Two years ago, I had a few operations. It was all bad then. But it all worked out in the end.""
He added: ""I have check-ups every few months, and that's going well. I'm getting fitter and fitter.""
Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Barcelona and Bayern Munich before managing Manchester United from 2014 to 2016, leading them to an FA Cup win in his final game.

World Cup will use more indoor venues for day-time kick-offs to combat heat,Infantino acts after player welfare fears at Club World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/world-cup-will-use-more-indoor-venues-for-day-time-kick-offs-to-combat-heat,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 18:51:47",Guardian sport,['Chelsea'],"Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, has said indoor air-conditioned venues will be used as much as possible for day-time kick-offs at the 2026 World Cup to combat expected high temperatures. Concerns have been raised about player welfare during the Club World Cup in the US, which will co-host next year’s tournament with Canada and Mexico.
Enzo Fernández described conditions during Chelsea’s semi-final against Fluminense, when the temperature was 35C, as “very dangerous”.
Infantino said better use would be made of indoor air-conditioned venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Vancouver. There are 16 host venues – 11 in the US, two in Canada and three in Mexico. Vancouver has by far the coolest average June and July temperatures of the indoor venues.
“The heat is definitely an issue,” Infantino said. “It’s an issue around the world. I remember it was the same in the Olympics in Paris and in other football games. But we have stadiums in America that are covered and one in Canada in Vancouver and we will definitely use these stadiums more during the day.”
Infantino declared the Club World Cup a huge financial success and said the revamped, 32-team tournament had generated close to £1.5bn in revenue. The competition concludes in New York on Sunday with a final between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, which is due to be attended by Donald Trump.
Infantino said: “The golden era of global club football has started. We can say definitely this Fifa Club World Cup has been a huge, huge, huge success. Of course, there are a lot of positives, some negatives. We respect everyone’s opinion. It has been successful.
“We heard financially it would not work but I can say we generated over $2bn (£1.48bn) in revenues with this competition. We earned on average $33m per match. There is no other cup competition in the world that comes close to $33m per match. It is already the most successful club competition in the world.”
Infantino responded to criticism over poor attendances at some matches by saying 2.5m tickets were sold, equating to an average of 40,000 per match. “There is no league in the world with that number, except the Premier League which, of course, has home teams.”
Infantino thanked Trump for his endorsement of the tournament. “He loves the game,” he said. “You cannot organise a competition like this without the full support of the government. Great thanks to president Trump – he has been fantastic and he is attending the final tomorrow as well.”

Former England striker Andy Carroll signs for Dagenham & Redbridge,Carroll makes surprise move to non-league club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/former-england-striker-andy-carroll-signs-for-dagenham-redbridge,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 22:14:53",Guardian sport,"['Liverpool', 'Manchester City']","Andy Carroll will play sixth-tier football next season after signing for the National League South side Dagenham & Redbridge on a free transfer.
The former Newcastle, West Ham and Liverpool striker, 36, who became a free agent after leaving Bordeaux this summer, has reportedly taken a minority stake in the club as part of a Qatari-led takeover, and will be managed by the former Manchester City striker Lee Bradbury.
Carroll, who won nine England caps, told the Sun: “I really enjoyed my time in Bordeaux but it’s time for me to get settled with my family. I was getting offers from clubs in France, Italy and Spain, but I wanted to come home.
“I could sign for a top club, but me and the managers might not see eye to eye, so I just want to be somewhere I’m going to be happy. It’s never been about the money for me, I could have signed for a lot more money. I just love playing football.”

The signing coincided with Dagenham announcing a takeover by a consortium of private investors from Qatar, subject to approval by the FA and the National League.
Youseph Al Sharif, representing the group, told the club’s website: “I’ve followed English football closely for years, and I know what clubs like Dagenham represent to their communities. We’re stepping into something that matters to people’s lives, and we don’t take that lightly.

Viktor Gyökeres fails to report for Sporting training as he targets Arsenal move,Striker facing fine after missing squad trip to Algarve,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/viktor-gyokeres-fails-report-sporting-training-arsenal,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 18:39:48",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"Viktor Gyökeres faces disciplinary action from Sporting after he missed his deadline to report for pre-season training. The striker, who wants a move to Arsenal, had been asked to join the rest of the squad by 5pm local time on Saturday.
Gyökeres’s absence was not entirely unexpected, the Sweden international having informed the club of his intention not to return for the new campaign. There is a faint hope at Sporting that a deal with Arsenal could be finalised this weekend.
Sporting intend to fine Gyökeres unless he can present a legitimate justification for his absence, such as medical grounds, extended leave authorised by the board or an urgent family matter. The squad left for a training camp in the Algarve without him.
The Portuguese champions, for whom Gyökeres scored 54 times in 52 games last season, have no pressing need to sell. That is the primary reason why their president, Frederico Varandas, has taken such a firm stance in negotiations with Arsenal. He has said he wants €70m (£60.2m) plus €10m in add-ons after rejecting €65m plus €15m.
“We are calm,” Varandas said on Saturday evening. “Everything can be resolved with the close of the transfer window, a heavy fine and an apology to the group.” With reference to Arsenal he said: “If they don’t want to pay Viktor’s fair market value we are very comfortable with that for the next three years.”
Sporting are in a position of financial stability and sustained on-pitch success, unlike for much of the past two decades. They have won three of the past five Primeira Liga titles, after a 19-year drought, and benefit from the regular revenue stream of Champions League qualification. With the budget for the coming season secured, the club are under no obligation to cash in on key assets. Gyökeres has been central to Sporting’s resurgence, scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances, and has three years left on his contract.
“If the geniuses who are outlining this strategy think this puts pressure on me to ease the player’s exit, not only are they completely wrong but they’re also making the players’s exit conditions even more complicated,” Varandas said. “No one is above the club’s interests.”
Noni Madueke is close to finalising his £52m move from Chelsea to Arsenal after being granted permission to return to London from the Club World Cup as Chelsea prepare to face Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday’s final. The 23-year-old will sign a five-year contract. Kepa Arrizabalaga left Chelsea for Arsenal at the start of the month.
Madueke will provide much-needed cover for Bukayo Saka on the right and is also capable of playing on the left, but Mikel Arteta still wants to add more creativity. Arsenal are expected to open negotiations with Crystal Palace over Eberechi Eze, although they are yet to make a formal offer. The England international, who has a £67.5m release clause, is thought to be open to the move.
Arsenal have also made progress in negotiations over a new contract for Ethan Nwaneri, who was part of the England Under-21 squad crowned European champions last month. He has attracted interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany but is expected to join his fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skelly in agreeing a deal to stay.
