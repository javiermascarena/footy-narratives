Liverpool to rival Newcastle for Ekitike after being told Isak not for sale,Liverpool&#160;are expected to rival&#160;Newcastle&#160;for&#160;Hugo Ekitike&#160;after being told&#160;Alexander Isak&#160;is not for sale in this window.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13397072/hugo-ekitike-liverpool-to-rival-newcastle-for-eintracht-frankfurt-forward-after-alexander-isak-stance-reiterated,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 13:37:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool are expected to rival Newcastle for Hugo Ekitike after being told Alexander Isak is not for sale in this window.
The Premier League champions have always been interested in Isak but it is understood Newcastle have no interest in selling their striker and value him at least at £150m.
Liverpool are set to turn their attentions to Eintracht Frankfurt's Ekitike, who was the subject of a rejected club-record bid from Newcastle in the last 24 hours.
The Reds have been scoping out the market all summer for possible centre-forward options, establishing availability and price - but they have not made an offer for Isak.
Sources on Merseyside insist no formal contact has been made between the clubs, contrary to reports elsewhere.
Arsenal have been another club interested in Isak this summer but they are now closing in on a deal for Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres.
Ekitike is one of the other top strikers on the market this summer along with Victor Osimhen, Benjamin Sesko and many more.
Sky Sports News already reported that Frankfurt rejected Newcastle's formal £70m bid this morning - as first reported by Sky Germany.
Frankfurt believe there are other clubs who have signalled they are willing to pay more for the striker, whom they value at £85m.
Newcastle held talks with Ekitike's representatives in Austria on Monday, as they look to sign the striker they have kept tabs on for a number of years.
Newcastle tried and failed to sign Ekitike in 2022 but he chose PSG instead. Frankfurt then paid PSG just £14m for the 23-year-old last summer.
Isak is Newcastle's current club-record signing after he joined in a £63m deal from Real Sociedad in August 2022.
Ekitike scored 22 goals in 48 games across all competitions last season for Frankfurt as he helped them qualify for the Champions League.
He has been a Manchester United target this summer after the club explored the conditions of a deal, while Chelsea have also been interested along with Liverpool.
Newcastle have spent £55m on one major summer signing so far following the arrival of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest.
Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
It's a very delicate situation. Liverpool would like either of the two strikers, and Newcastle would like both.
Liverpool very much like Alexander Isak but have been told he's not for sale. Newcastle are desperate to hold onto him this window, he's got three years left on his contract and the club are in a very strong position.
Expect Liverpool to come to the table now in the race for Hugo Ekitike. Frankfurt have felt there are a couple of other clubs who were willing to spend more than the £70m that Newcastle had offered and seen turned down.
You speak to any Newcastle supporter and they would say that only they could at one stage have potentially both players and 24 hours later have potentially neither, but that's not the case.
I fully expect Alexander Isak to remain at St James' Park this summer, and Newcastle will dig their heels in and reject any approaches.
Their attempts to bring in Ekitike will be a lot more difficult now though, knowing Liverpool are interested.
Liverpool have money to spend, they need a new striker and Isak would've been their number-one choice. But he is Newcastle's number-one choice too.
Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:
Alexander Isak's strike partner? His replacement at St James' Park? Or Liverpool's back-up option for the Newcastle forward? Which one will it be for Hugo Ekitike?
The 23-year-old is commanding a huge £85m transfer fee and the German club know what they are doing.
They are fully aware that Ekitike has the potential to be one of the top No 9s in Europe - they do not want the forward's sale to look cheap in a few years' time.
Parallels can be drawn to the £63m club-record fee Newcastle paid for Isak. It looked like an expensive deal for the then-Real Sociedad striker - but certainly looks like a good piece of business for the Magpies now. If the reports are to be believed, Isak is now worth at least double that.
That is not the only comparison between the two forwards - as everything points towards Ekitike being another Isak in the making.

Liverpool reject £58.5m bid for Diaz from Bayern Munich,Liverpool have rejected Bayern Munich's first official offer for winger Luis Diaz.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396946/luis-diaz-transfer-news-liverpool-reject-bayern-munichs-58-5m-bid-for-winger,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:12:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have rejected Bayern Munich's first official offer for winger Luis Diaz.
The bid is believed to be worth £58.5m - and the club have turned it down outright.
Sky Sports News exclusively revealed on July 2 that Liverpool had told Bayern that Diaz is not for sale.
Nevertheless, Bayern believe Diaz is keen to join them and have returned with a first official bid.
According to Sky in Germany, Bayern are preparing another offer for Diaz, who remains a top priority for the German champions.
If they do, then Liverpool have another decision to make - but the club's stance has been unequivocal so far this summer.
They consider him not for sale and do not want any further bids. It is said Bayern are prepared to offer Diaz at least a four-year deal.
Liverpool's position on Diaz remains that he is an important player not just for the coming season but for the remainder of his contract, which has two years left to run.
The Anfield club are understood to have made that clear to all interested clubs, which has also included Barcelona this summer.
Liverpool's internal accounting of assets values Diaz at more than £86m (€100m+) and the club have not set a sale price because they do not want to.
Diaz has had interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia too - a market that also recently appeared to value Bruno Fernandes, who is two years older, at around £86.8m (€100m).
The Colombia international is understood to have been open to moving away from Anfield in the last two summer transfer windows but remained an important first-team player last season, scoring 13 goals in 36 Premier League appearances as Liverpool won the title.
Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher speaking at the start of May:
""It's an interesting one, where I think you could flip a coin with some people saying they'd love him to sign a new contract and some say it might be the time where you get good money for him because he's at a good age.
""I think Luis Diaz has been one of the best left wingers in the Premier League this season. I don't think he's quite Sadio Mane, so I think Liverpool supporters are actually still thinking, 'we haven't quite replaced Mane', but how many of them is there about?
""If I'm being honest, for the majority of this season up until Christmas, I was thinking you sell Diaz in the summer.
""The way he's played and the way Liverpool's front line might change, and with the fact that he can play through the middle in the manager's eyes, he's now going to stay and I think it might be other players who move on in the front line rather than Diaz.""

Merson 'shocked' by Madueke signing - 'Are Arsenal preparing for Saka exit?',"In his latest column, Sky Sports' Paul Merson dissects Arsenal's transfer business so far, giving his verdict on the potential signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea...",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396962/paul-merson-shocked-by-noni-madueke-signing-are-arsenal-preparing-for-bukayo-saka-exit,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:18:00",Paul Merson,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","In his latest column, Sky Sports' Paul Merson dissects Arsenal's transfer business so far, giving his verdict on the potential signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea...
I am flabbergasted by Arsenal signing Noni Madueke.
I'm shocked. If Arsenal went and bought any player from Chelsea, he'd have been the last one I thought they'd sign.
I just don't see it. It's a lot of money for a player who is not a prolific goalscorer. He's the sort of player that has a good game here and a good game there, but that'll be it. The consistency of performance isn't there.
I hope he proves me wrong, but he'll have the good games, just like he did for England last month. But then you won't see him for a few weeks.
For me, at Chelsea, I'd have always played Jadon Sancho ahead of him. It's not to be disrespectful to the player but I am flabbergasted by the money Arsenal are paying for him.
Chelsea just won't believe that this deal has come to them. They won't believe their luck.
The only thing for Chelsea is how will Jamie Gittens settle in after his move from Dortmund. How good will he be? But they won't have too many deliberations about sealing the deal for Madueke to move across London.
What I don't get is that Madueke's best position is playing on the right, cutting inside and getting shots away. Who does that for Arsenal?
Bukayo Saka. And he's not coming out of the Arsenal starting XI.
So, with that in mind, £52m is a lot of money for a back up player, in this day and age.
There's also Ethan Nwaneri coming through and getting first-team minutes. Everyone tells me how good he is. There's also a kid called Max Dowman coming through. I know he is a very young player but the stories you hear about him and the clips you see; they are off the chart.
That's what I don't get, unless they don't fancy Nwaneri as a player.
Call me a cynic, but is there another reason why they are doing this deal?
Are there concerns about the future of Saka?
Are they getting this deal done and then all of a sudden it allows a potential sale of Saka or someone else.
The one player at Arsenal who has to play every week is Saka. When he doesn't play, they are not the same team. The players around him are not the same when he doesn't play.
If fit, he plays. So why do you spend £52m on a backup for him?
If you asked me whether Arsenal should sign Eberechi Eze or Madueke, I'd have said Eze all day long.
Now that's a deal I can see happening and it would be a brilliant signing for Arsenal.
He's perfect.
Arsenal struggle when teams come to the Emirates and put everyone behind the ball. Teams want to limit the space Arsenal have to play in and they have struggled to break teams down with those tactics.
For me, that's where Eze comes in. He's got the X-factor and the ability to break a low block down.
Away from home, maybe he's not the answer. Against the likes of Liverpool and Man City, they may come under the cosh for a bit, and they may have to play slightly differently.
But that's why you have a big squad. At home, against the lesser teams, where they have 70 to 80 per cent of the ball, let Eze go and do what he wants because he will make something happen.
It would be a fantastic signing for Arsenal.
On the whole, Arsenal have done good business this summer.
Martin Zubimendi is a top buy. Viktor Gyokeres is also a good buy, but we'll have to see whether his form from Portugal translates to the Premier League.
How many players have ripped it up in Portugal and Holland but then not ripped it up in England? I'm sure people will be screaming examples at me where the form has translated, but he'll have to prove it.
Remember, he was at Coventry and there wasn't a queue to sign him then. No-one was willing to take a chance.
He went to Portugal and has done really well, but it isn't the strongest league in Europe.
Now he's going for decent money and for me, it's a case of watch this space.
You can speculate about this signing and that signing, do they need more, and do they need another winger? But Arsenal need to stay injury-free this season.
In the end, Liverpool's run with the players injury-free was a big part of them winning the title. The big players at Liverpool stayed fit and that made a huge difference.
If Arsenal can do that, they will go really close to winning the Premier League.
For example, at the back, William Saliba and Gabriel come as a pair. When they both play, they are formidable. However, when one is missing, I don't think the other is the same player.
That's the problem for Arsenal throughout the squad, and that's my concern. However, if they stay injury-free they are massive players in the race for the title.

Forest threaten Spurs and Gibbs-White's agent with legal action,"Nottingham Forest have written to both Tottenham and Morgan Gibbs-White's agent, threatening legal action over what they believe was an unlawful approach for the player and a breach of confidentiality laid out in the player's contract.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13397092/morgan-gibbs-white-transfer-news-nottingham-forest-threaten-tottenham-hotspur-and-players-agent-with-legal-action,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 17:00:00",Rob Dorsett,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Nottingham Forest have written to both Tottenham and Morgan Gibbs-White's agent, threatening legal action over what they believe was an unlawful approach for the player and a breach of confidentiality laid out in the player's contract.
Sky Sports News has been told the letters put both parties ""on legal notice"", reminding them of their obligations and spelling out how Forest believe both Spurs and Gibbs-White's representatives have breached Premier League rules and the terms of the player's contract.
Tottenham have not commented publicly, but it is understood they believe they have done nothing wrong, and they retain an interest in signing the midfielder after being unsuccessful with a £60m bid.
Far from backing down on this issue, Forest have made it clear that even though they have taken no punitive action so far, they are prepared to do so in the future - both via the Premier League and the law courts.
Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett answers the key questions around the transfer saga...
Even though it is relatively commonplace for clubs to sound out their would-be transfer targets in advance, 'tapping up' (or any meaningful negotiation) is banned under the Premier League rules.
Rule T.3 in the Premier League handbook says a buying club must get written permission from the selling club before approaching any player, or they face disciplinary action.
""Any Club which… makes an approach either directly or indirectly to a Contract Player except as permitted by either Rule T.1.2 or Rule T.2 shall be in breach of these Rules and may be dealt with under the provisions of Section W (Disciplinary) of these Rules.""
Concerning Gibbs-White's current contract, legally there is a conflict between the rights of the employer and those of the employee.
Forest have a contractual agreement for the terms of Gibbs-White's contract - and specifically the level of his release clause - to be kept confidential, so if that has been breached, they have a legal case.
Conversely, Gibbs-White has a contractual agreement that if another club is prepared to pay a certain transfer fee, he can leave the City Ground. He has a potential legal claim there, too.
Neither side wants to see this end up in the courts but both sides have that as a possibility in the background.
Sky Sports News has learned that Forest have been trying for almost 12 months to open negotiations with Gibbs-White over a new and improved contract at the City Ground, but he has refused to engage in those talks.
Forest are prepared to give him a huge pay rise, in exchange for the removal of the release clause, which would make him one of, if not the, biggest earner at the club.
From Forest's point of view, Gibbs-White's refusal to discuss a new contract shows he doesn't have a long-term commitment to Forest.
The result is the current stalemate. If Gibbs-White really wants to join Tottenham, it may be that he has to bring legal action against Forest - claiming a breach of contract - to try to force a move.
There is no indication that he is prepared to do that currently, and in fact he returned to pre-season training yesterday as scheduled, with the rest of Forest's international players.
Alternatively, it could be that Spurs are prepared to increase their offer for the player, and pay an amount above his release clause, to try to placate Forest and re-open lines of communication.
Again, there is no indication at this stage that Spurs are prepared to do that, and there is no dialogue between the two clubs.
It is also possible that another club takes advantage of the impasse, and comes in with a separate offer for the player. Manchester City showed an interest in Gibbs-White earlier in the window but have not pursued that interest.
Neither Forest nor Spurs have commented on these latest developments.
It is a very sensitive one. They don't want arguably their best player to be unhappy, but they also don't want to be viewed as a 'selling club' or one that is lacking ambition.
Following the departure of Anthony Elanga to Newcastle, were Gibbs-White to leave too, Forest will have lost two of their best players - albeit by earning £115m - before the season starts.
Marinakis will strongly defend his own reputation and the standing of his football club, although the presence of the release clause is of real concern and ultimately means Forest don't have control over the future of one of their key assets.
Marinakis and Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, are among the toughest negotiators in the Premier League and neither is likely to back down.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

The Man Utd Five: Ousted but not out,Five unwanted players from Manchester United remain at the club as pre-season gets under way - what is next for them and the club?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp86p606gvko,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:35:37",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Ruben Amorim was unequivocal.
Did he know what he wanted his squad to look like when Manchester United returned for the start of pre-season training in July?
""Yes,"" he said. ""I have a clear idea what we want.
""As you know, we are a bit limited and we can't do it all in one summer but there is a clear picture for what we want.""
These words were just over six weeks ago, as the United head coach bade farewell to journalists following the club's end-of-season tour to Asia.
With the club back in training, and the first pre-season game against Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday, it is fair to assume that desired clarity has not yet materialised.
The unwanted five, crucial to free up funds for incoming transfers, are still at the club, though Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrrell Malacia are training separately from the rest of the squad.
Just one major addition has been made - Matheus Cunha, a £62.5m arrival from Wolverhampton Wanderers.
So, what is going on behind the scenes, and what is the prospect of Amorim re-shaping the squad to his desires? Might United have to consider selling some of their other players to raise funds?
The 'bomb squad' have been truly ousted
On 4 July, United made it known that the five unwanted players had asked to leave and would not train with the remainder of Amorim's squad. Rashford's number 10 shirt was given to Cunha.
Since their exile, the only significant development involving the quintet was news that they cannot access United's Carrington training ground - which they can enter for rehabilitation and medical purposes - until Amorim and his squad have left for the day.
The members of the so-called 'bomb squad', a reference to their being bombed out, can train together at Carrington if they wish and combine that with work away from the complex, which is the final stages of a multi-million pound upgrade. But, as far as Amorim is concerned, they are done.
This move makes it impossible to think there can be any repeat of the 'peace deal' brokered between Sancho and former boss Erik ten Hag last summer. That agreement led to the England man joining United on their tour of the United States before he left for Chelsea on loan.
More pertinently, it lets interested clubs know those players are not wanted, meaning United are negotiating from a position of weakness.
And this is a big problem.
Talks likely to go to the window's end
Between them, Antony, Sancho and Malacia cost the club more than £167m.
Rashford and Garnacho - both 'home grown' for the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rule purposes - are worth a combined 95m euros (£82.34m), according to the transfermarkt.co.uk website.
Clearly, Amorim could find good use for that money if they were sold.
But, so far, there is no sign of that happening.
And this aspect is critical.
Those at Old Trafford hope Bryan Mbeumo's protracted move from Brentford for more than £60m is completed before Amorim and his squad set off on their pre-season travels. But after that, United will be relying largely on sales to fund more deals.
There have been rumours.
Rashford has been linked with Barcelona, which would be his preference.
Sancho with Juventus, although coach Igor Tudor's first choice is to complete the permanent signing of Portugal international Francisco Conceicao, who spent last year on loan from FC Porto.
Real Betis are still hopeful of getting Antony back after his successful stint there over the second half of last season.
Garnacho's name continues to be mentioned at Chelsea, Napoli and his former club Atletico Madrid.
Malacia has been suggested as a potential target for Celtic.
But none of this has turned into anything concrete.
Rashford and Sancho are among the Premier League's highest earners. Unless either accepts a pay cut - and there have been no suggestions either is willing to do that - United will almost certainly have to offer some kind of financial incentive to allow a permanent transfer or loan to be concluded.
Neither Antony nor Malacia are in the same pay bracket. But neither are the clubs in the market to sign them, suggesting United are going to be in the same situation with that pair, just on a lesser scale.
As for Garnacho, it is tough to imagine anyone being willing to pay the £60m fee United started the summer believing they could get for him.
As the possibility grows that deals to offload the 'bomb squad' will not be done until much nearer the transfer deadline on 1 September, the question arises as to whether United would look to sell anyone else.
What are Man Utd's other options to raise money?
It is notable that United have generated more from sell-ons in this window than they have through player sales.
Anthony Elanga's £55m move from Nottingham Forest to Newcastle earned the club £6m.
And the sell-on figure is expected to grow very quickly this week.
Defender Alvaro Carreras has now completed his move to Real Madrid from Benfica. United get 20% of any sale price over £5m. As a fee of 50m euros (£43.33m) is reported to have been agreed, United stand to receive around £7.6m.
In addition, Maxi Oyedele's pending 6m euro (£5.2m) move from Legia Warsaw to Strasbourg could earn United £2m, as they have a 40% sell-on clause on the 20-year-old midfielder from Salford.
Whether that is enough to release funds to make more signings remains to be seen.
So who else it leaves the question of who else they might have to consider selling.
Kobbie Mainoo is yet to agree a long-term extension to his contract, which expires in 2027, and Toby Collyer also has two years left on the deal he signed in June last year.
Both contracts have one-year options, so in that sense, United are covered.
But the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and - eventually - Mbeumo, coupled with captain Bruno Fernandes' decision to reject summer overtures from the Saudi Pro-League, suggests places in either central midfield, or the narrow number 10 roles Amorim likes, will be at a premium. And United already have Casemiro, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee, Amad Diallo and Manuel Ugarte.
Amorim previously said he would be able to operate with a smaller squad this season without the added complication of European football.
And so there will be players beyond the 'bomb squad' with a question over their Old Trafford future.
A squad with a lot of uncertainties beyond the unwanted
Injuries have dented the confidence of Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez, who must compete for a place in a defence containing promising youngsters Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven.
Andre Onana's pre-season hamstring issue gives Amorim an opportunity to assess his goalkeeping options but, in truth, unless 21-year-old Radek Vitek steps up, the choice will be to stick or twist with the Cameroon international given Altay Bayindir was given his chance at the end of last season and failed to impress.
It is a similar story in attack.
The pursuit of Liam Delap, who instead chose Chelsea, emphasises Amorim feels he can improve on Rasmus Hojlund.
Viktor Gyokeres, who played for Amorim at Sporting, has also decided against a move to United.
Ollie Watkins, who lost his place at Aston Villa when Rashford arrived from United on loan, has been linked with a move to Old Trafford. So too have out-of-contract pair Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jamie Vardy. They are all names to suggest United might be better off giving Hojlund one more chance.
But can Amorim trust that he is ready to fulfil the promise that prompted United to pay Atalanta £72m for him two years ago?
Hojlund himself has been linked with his old boss Gian Piero Gasperini at Roma.
But, as with so many players, turning vague interest into reality is not easy.
When he spoke to fanzine United We Stand last month, chief executive Omar Berrada said the pain of last season's 15th-placed finish, the worst since the 1973-74 relegation campaign, was self-inflicted in the belief reward would follow.
""He's suffered in the Premier League, and the team has suffered,"" he said.
""But we saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give time to Ruben to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League, so by the time that we got to now, we'll have had all the discussions about what the squad needs and the two-to-three-year plan to get to a squad that's capable of winning the Premier League.""
There is still time before the opening Premier League game against Arsenal on 17 August for the clarity Amorim seemed so sure of when he spoke in Hong Kong to emerge.
But as of now, the picture is too cloudy for any United fan to feel confident about what lies ahead.

Newcastle bid for Ekitike; Liverpool want Isak,Newcastle are exploring a move for Hugo Ekitike - but would the French striker play with Alexander Isak or replace him?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g80nryyyro,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:34:08",Joe Rindl,['Liverpool'],"It is not often supporters are worried by rumours their club might be about to break their transfer record.
But that is what is happening among some Newcastle United fans, with the Magpies moving for Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike.
Newcastle's initial bid of £70m has been turned down by the Bundesliga club as the Magpies seek to agree what would be a club-record deal to land the coveted young forward.
With Premier League champions Liverpool also in the market for a central striker and known to have firm interest in Newcastle's Alexander Isak, it is inevitable some are drawing a certain conclusion.
BBC Sport understands the Premier League champions have made a move towards a deal for the Sweden striker in recent days. They have also explored the parameters for other centre-forward targets.
According to sources, it is believed a package to sign Isak could cost up to £130m - and the Magpies have been steadfast in their stance that their superstar striker is not for sale.
Those who know Newcastle believe they are trying to build a multi-layered attack capable of quickly switching tactics.
Those who know Ekitike, who has also been linked with Liverpool, know him as a versatile forward capable of scoring from all sorts of positions.
Newcastle have maintained throughout the summer that their top players - and Isak is certainly one of those - are not available for transfer.
So would Ekitike be a partner for Isak - or is there is a danger he could be his replacement?
'Message is still that Isak's not for sale'
Isak, 25, joined Newcastle from Real Sociedad in 2022 for £63m.
He is their record purchase and Newcastle supporters will tell you he has been worth every penny.
Over the past three seasons he has scored 54 league goals and that strike rate has led to him regularly been linked with a move.
During the second half of last season Ekitike, like Isak, played as a lone striker. The 23-year-old scored 15 goals and contributed eight assists during the campaign as Frankfurt finished third in the Bundesliga.
So, two players who play in a very similar way and a team that has generally played with just one central striker under Eddie Howe. Where could the Frenchman fit in?
""It's not a given that Ekitike will play second fiddle to Isak - in fact there is a hope that they could play together,"" believes BBC Newcastle's Matthew Raisbeck.
""Newcastle like versatility. They tried to sign Chelsea's Joao Pedro this summer, who is another versatile striker.
""I don't expect them to switch formation for the first game of the season, but this move would allow a greater scope to change tactics throughout the game.
""The message is still that Isak is not for sale. Newcastle are determined to keep him and don't need to sell for financial reasons.
""They are in the Champions League next season and want to be competitive in the league and all the cups so, even before Callum Wilson left, they were always going to need another striker.
""Ekitike has the profile they want and allows the team to be so much more flexible tactically.
""Newcastle have quality but often at times last season lacked depth. This signing would tick both of those boxes.""
What Ekitike would bring to Newcastle - the stats
Signing Ekitike could give Newcastle a pre-season selection conundrum.
The statistics do suggest Isak and Ekitike have a lot of overlap in their play and have the same best position - playing as a lone striker.
Isak played 98% of his Premier League minutes last season as a central striker, only briefly featuring on the left of a front three.
His central role in Newcastle's attack is surely not to be messed with, given a return of 23 goals in 34 games.
However, a similar argument could be made for Ekitike. He scored 15 league goals in 31 starts for Frankfurt last season and played as a striker 95% of the time.
Newcastle are also well-stocked in wide areas, with Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, Jacob Murphy and new £55m signing Anthony Elanga.
Touch maps for both forwards show they share a tendency to get on the ball in the inside left channel, but with Ekitike roaming more freely and a little deeper.
This perhaps offers encouragement to those who believe they can play alongside each other, with Ekitike at times dropping back to link with the midfielders.
He is a provider as well as a scorer, ranking in the top 6% among forwards for creating chances in last season's Bundesliga.
'Ekitike is versatile and smart'
Newcastle's interest in Ekitike goes back to January 2022, the first transfer window with their Saudi Arabian owners.
Back then they were unable to make a deal work and in the summer they ultimately chose Isak instead.
But the admiration has remained for a player who started at Reims and left for Paris St-Germain in 2023 but failed to make an impact and had a spell on loan at Frankfurt before joining the German club permanently last summer.
""His tactical understanding is one of his great strengths,"" German football writer Constantin Eckner told BBC Sport.
""He served as a lone striker as well as part of a two-striker set-up under Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller.
""During the first half of last season, Ekitike and Omar Marmoush formed a fearsome strike pairing which was torn apart when Manchester City signed Marmoush for £63m in January.
""Subsequently, Frankfurt did not acquire a replacement for Marmoush and instead changed the tactical set-up, with Ekitike the lone striker.
""He is versatile and not just a striker that feels at home inside the box. Ekitike might not be the most dynamic player, but he can get past defenders with smart moves.""
Eckner also told BBC Sport that Frankfurt's sporting director Markus Krosche has stated the club will not let Ekitike go for less than £86m.
He added: ""It seems as if the Bundesliga side are fine with selling yet another top player to a Premier League club.
""Their current model is that they find these gems, try to develop them and then fund their next signings through the money they generate.""

Liverpool reject £58m Bayern Munich offer for Diaz,"Liverpool reject a £58.6m opening offer from Bayern Munich for Colombia forward Luis Diaz, and value him in excess of £87m.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwye24e1ejno,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 14:17:38",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have rejected a £58.6m opening offer from Bayern Munich for forward Luis Diaz.
The German club approached Liverpool earlier this month but were told Diaz was not for sale.
That position was reinforced on Tuesday as Liverpool turned down the Bundesliga side's first bid for the 28-year-old Colombia international.
Liverpool value Diaz, whose contract expires in the summer of 2027, in excess of £87m as a key member of Arne Slot's squad.
He scored 22 goals for club and country last season, with 13 of those in the Premier League as Liverpool won the title by 10 points.
Diaz attracted interest from Manchester City last summer, and also has admirers in Saudi Arabia.
Liverpool are in the market for a striker and are known to have firm interest in Newcastle's Sweden international Alexander Isak.
BBC Sport understands the Premier League champions have made genuine moves towards a deal to sign Isak in recent days. They have also explored the parameters for other centre-forward targets.

Man City agree record 10-year kit deal worth £1bn,"Manchester City extend their kit partnership with Puma for at least 10 years, with the contract understood to be worth a minimum of £1bn, making it the largest deal in the Premier League.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c628ek81dzno,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 19:26:43",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City have extended their kit partnership with Puma for at least another 10 years, with the contract understood to be worth a minimum of £1bn, making it the largest deal in the Premier League.
City initially signed a £65m-a-year deal with the German kit manufacturer in 2019 but the parties have agreed an extension until at least 2035, worth a record £100m a year to the club.
That figure surpasses the £90m deal signed by rivals Manchester United with Adidas in 2023, while champions Liverpool will also be with the same manufacturer from this season after agreeing a reported, external £60m a season.
City have enjoyed an unprecedented period of success since 2019, claiming four Premier League titles as well as the Treble two years ago, but finished last season without a major trophy.
The two parties have achieved club record sales globally, according to City.
In their accounts up to 30 June 2024, City announced a Premier League record revenue of £715m, while commercial revenue increased from £341.4m to £344.7m.
City Football Group (CFG) chief executive Ferran Soriano said: ""We joined forces with Puma with the ambition to challenge ourselves and go beyond the expectations. We have achieved this and more over the last six seasons.
""Puma have seamlessly integrated into our organisation, and we have enjoyed many historic moments together, engaging fans globally.""
Puma chief executive Arthur Hoeld added: ""Puma's partnership with Manchester City has been a great success both on and off the pitch.
""Trophies, a perfect stage for our performance products and commercial success were exceptional.""
Why Puma are investing so much into City - analysis
Brand Finance, external head of sports services Hugo Hensley told BBC Sport: ""Brand Finance's fan research, conducted in June in 14 markets, shows that Manchester City are the sixth most followed team globally and among a top echelon of 15 clubs that carry a true global appeal.
""The £100m-a-year kit deal with Puma is a huge amount of money but I would feel they are doing it with a strong knowledge of the return on investment that it has generated so far - through increased brand consideration, purchase, loyalty and price premium attached to their products.
""A huge part of the investment in this partnership is about the exposure it generates - management will be hoping it helps Puma at the top of the customer funnel by improving awareness and familiarity.
""Out of the top 10 clubs featured in this year's most valuable brand rankings, City has the joint-highest percentage of fans that have claimed to have purchased merchandise (70%), level with Real Madrid. This a key market that Puma are hoping to tap into, given the strong propensity for fans to purchase new replica kits on an annual basis.
""As the top English football club brand, City are excelling not only in on-field success but also in brand value and strength. In 2024, Manchester City's brand value rose 7% to £1.39bn, placing them second only to Real Madrid and ahead of major competitors such as Barcelona (£1.3bn), Manchester United and Liverpool (both £1.21bn). That is a massive achievement.
""Puma's long-term commitment acknowledges the firm belief that  City will continue to dominate on and off the pitch for many seasons to come. On this trajectory of current commercial growth across the Premier League, the £100m price tag could soon be a bargain.""
