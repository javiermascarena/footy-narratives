Eze Q&A: How a shock North London U turn unfolded - and what next,With Eberechi Eze heading for boyhood club Arsenal after the Gunners stole a march on north London rivals Spurs - who looked certain to sign him - what's the full story in yet another dramatic saga in one of the most memorable transfer windows ever?,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415595/eberechi-eze-qa-how-arsenal-beat-tottenham-hotspur-to-crystal-palace-winger-and-what-he-can-bring-to-emirates,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 10:45:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","With Eberechi Eze heading for boyhood club Arsenal after the Gunners stole a march on north London rivals Spurs - who looked certain to sign him - what's the full story in yet another dramatic saga in one of the most memorable transfer windows ever?
At the start of Wednesday morning, Tottenham believed they had a deal agreed for the 27-year-old to join them for £67.5m, including add-ons.
But then in stepped Arsenal - who had previously had an interest in the England winger - to gazump them at the final hurdle.
It leaves Gunners fans delighted, their left-wing problems seemingly sorted and Spurs supporters, naturally, in a state of shock at losing out on a major summer signing to their closest rivals.
How has it all played out so far, and what's next for Arsenal, Spurs and Eze?
Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:
I have some sympathy for Spurs. This is not Football Manager, this is real life. I don't want to kick Spurs when they're down - I'm trying to see it from the perspective of their hierarchy.
I think they did everything they could to try to sell the club to Eze. A lot of Spurs fans are asking why they didn't trigger his release clause before Friday, but maybe they tried to do that and the player could've dragged his feet. Maybe he was keeping his options open.
Spurs fans are very angry and criticising Daniel Levy and the owners, but I think we should keep things in perspective; these kinds of things happen all the time in the window.
Ultimately, everyone knows Eze is an Arsenal fan, as are his whole family. He played for them until he was 13 when he was released.
Is this move motivated by the fact that Kai Havertz picked up this knee injury?
Or have they been really smart and avoided getting involved in a bidding war? They knew he would choose Arsenal if he had a choice - and waited for Spurs to agree a deal before they turned up at the 11th hour and matched it. I think it's a bit of both.
Today's a great day to be an Arsenal supporter. They have pulled off a real coup here. At the last minute, they matched Spurs' offer, and it's important to remember Eze himself is an Arsenal supporter.
His wish was very important in this - Arsenal matched Spurs' bid of £60m including £7.5m in add-ons. Remember, he had a release clause which expired last week which was worth up to £68m.
Arsenal have been interested in signing him all summer and their fans were crying out for them to make a move for him.
When you looked at how much business they had already done this summer you could suggest they had to sell before they brought in another player.
Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's previous release clause, of £68.5m - only £1m more than Arsenal are set to pay - expired last Friday.
Speaking after Sunday's 0-0 draw at Chelsea, which Eze started, Glasner said: ""I'm quite calm, but I also know we have two weeks to go, and I know Ebs' clause is gone, so it's the club's decision, and we will see what happens.""
Tottenham could have guaranteed they would have their offer accepted earlier in the window by hitting that target, but only agreed a fee for Eze after it had already expired.
So why didn't they try to trigger it? ""It might've needed paying in one lump sum, said Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol. ""They might've waited until it expired to get a better deal.""
Sky Sports News' Michael Bridge:
Tottenham Hotspur moved on from Eberechi Eze once it became clear he wanted to join Arsenal and they are now focusing on other targets.
Spurs want to sign a No 10, a winger and a centre back ahead of the deadline.
Several recent reports have linked Spurs with Tyler Dibling, but this is long-standing interest. There is interest in Monaco's Maghnes Akliouche.
It could be a very busy final few weeks at Spurs and clubs are aware they are prepared to pay £60m on the desired player after missing out on Morgan Gibbs-White and Eze for similar fees.
Spurs feel they couldn't have done any more on both failed deals.
Sky Sports' Ron Walker:
Last season, Arsenal's biggest difficulty was breaking down teams with a low block. They won only seven of 17 games where they had at least 60 per cent of the ball - picking up almost 0.4 points per game fewer than when they didn't.
In among his array of attacking talents, Eze has built a reputation as a defence breaker. Not only a technical marvel and excellent in one-on-one duels, he was one of the Premier League's best in delivering passes which broke opposition backlines last season. Only four players completed more take-ons across the Premier League in 2024/25.
He fits the bill for the defensive work rate Mikel Arteta demands, too. Eze won the ball back in the middle and defensive third more than almost any other attacking player in the Premier League last season.
Sky Sports' Paul Merson:
Eze is a brilliant signing for Arsenal. It's a game-changer and a perfect fit. If Arsenal had let Spurs get him, I'd have had to question what the club was doing because he's a quality player.
Arsenal struggle when teams come to the Emirates and put everyone behind the ball. Teams want to limit the space Arsenal have to play in and they have struggled to break teams down with those tactics.
We've seen it over the last few years where they have struggled to break teams down when it gets right to the business end of a game and the business end of a season.
For me, that's where Eze comes in at Arsenal. He's got the X-factor and in tight games, he has the ability to break a low block down.
Away from home, maybe he's not the answer. Against the likes of Liverpool and Man City, they may come under the cosh for a bit, and they may have to play slightly differently.
But that's why you have a big squad. At home, against the lesser teams, where they have 70 to 80 per cent of the ball, let Eze go and do what he wants because he will make something happen.
I think Arsenal win the league with Eze.
They had a chance without him because it's a real heads or tails season with Liverpool, and Man City played well on the opening weekend, but Eze helps get them over the line.
Sky Sports' Ron Walker:
If this late move for Eze is motivated by Havertz's injury, it stands to reason it will be someone else adding to their striking ranks because, bar a brief cameo as a false nine for England against Senegal earlier this summer, it's not a position where Eze has often featured.
It may instead mean a role change for Gabriel Martinelli, however. In fairness, the Brazilian has barely played through the middle in six years at the Emirates either, but it has long been seen as his eventual position by many Arsenal fans.
He was utilised as a No 9 against Liverpool late last season, more through necessity than design, but he showed a glimpse of what he can offer to supplement Viktor Gyokeres, Gabriel Jesus and Havertz as an option in spearheading Arsenal's attack.
After his goalscoring exploits at Anfield, Gary Neville told Sky Sports: ""I actually think in the last half of this game Martinelli showed he actually could be a really dangerous centre-forward with his runs in behind.""

Merson: X-factor Eze can take Arsenal to the title,<em>Sky Sports</em>' Paul Merson believes the signing of Eberechi Eze can take Arsenal to the Premier League title this season.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415592/eberechi-eze-can-take-arsenal-to-the-premier-league-title-says-paul-merson,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:00:00",Paul Merson,['Arsenal'],"Sky Sports' Paul Merson believes the signing of Eberechi Eze can take Arsenal to the Premier League title this season.
Arsenal have agreed a £67.5m deal to sign Eze after hijacking Tottenham Hotspur's move for the Crystal Palace forward.
The Gunners will pay a guaranteed £60m plus £7.5m in add-ons for the forward, with personal terms now close to being totally agreed. Eze's Arsenal medical could take place as soon as Friday.
Merson insists Eze moving to Arsenal is a ""game-changer"" with the former Gunner suggesting the England international could be a key figure in breaking down stubborn defences, particularly at Emirates Stadium.
""Eze is a brilliant signing for Arsenal,"" Merson said. ""It's a game-changer and a perfect fit.

""They had a chance without him because it's a real heads or tails season with Liverpool, and Man City played well on the opening weekend, but Eze help get them over the line.""
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
Eberechi Eze is electric. The 27-year-old is a delight to watch with his poise and swagger on the ball and craft to open up defences, not to mention his penchant for scoring spectacular strikes himself.
He finished last season as one of the hottest prospects in the country, scoring in six games in a row, including both the FA Cup semi-final and final at Wembley as he helped inspire Crystal Palace to their first ever major honour.
Last season wasn't all plain sailing, though. ""I think Ebere has had a strange season,"" said Palace boss Glasner at the end of March. ""He hasn't had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going. He's also struggled with strange injuries.""
Those comments came after Eze had ignited Palace in a FA Cup tie at Fulham, scoring one and setting up another. That standout display came on the back of a first goal for England. Fit and full of confidence, Eze was back to his best during the run-in.
It is that livewire maverick Arsenal will hope can unlock deep defences and bring a spark to their previously at-times predictable patterns of attack. He offers something completely different to Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli, the current wide left options and Viktor Gyokeres will be relishing the prospect of latching onto the type of passes which have proved so productive for Jean-Philippe Mateta.
After being released by the Gunners as a 13-year-old, Eze will be motivated to seize a second chance in north London - and, in his prime, he looks set to do just that and make a big impact for Mikel Arteta.

Premier League predictions: Chelsea to turn up heat on Potter,Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Chelsea will turn the heat up on West Ham boss Graham Potter on Friday Night Football.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415691/premier-league-predictions-and-best-bets-chelsea-to-turn-up-heat-on-graham-potter-and-9-1-jones-knows-weekend-treble,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 21:00:00",Lewis Jones,['Chelsea'],"Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Chelsea will turn the heat up on West Ham boss Graham Potter on Friday Night Football.
If you take the relegated teams out of the equation, West Ham rank bottom in the Premier League per 90 for expected goals, shots, shots on target, chances created from open play and passes played into the box since Graham Potter took charge.
There's a clear problem with converting their possession and territorial advantage into quality chance creation and scoring goals - not the first time we've said that about a Potter team.
It can be possession for the sake of possession. The structure is there, but the soul isn't. It's just not very West Ham. The locals want a team that plays with grit and conviction. It could just be that Potter is a bit too spreadsheety for the Hammers. And things could become worse in the short term.
Chelsea played just fine last weekend against Palace and had the most possession (72 per cent) and made the most passes (568) of all Premier League teams but failed to score from an expected goals tally of 1.7.
They won't leave these points out there. Chelsea to win and under 3.5 goals at 6/4 with Sky Bet stands out.
Here's a sentence that would have made absolutely zero sense this time last year: Tottenham are becoming a serious set-piece threat.
Under Ange Postecoglou it was all vibes and vertical football, but under Thomas Frank there's good reason to believe Spurs could evolve into a set-piece machine. Brentford ranked second for expected goals from such situations last season in the Premier League and the early signs are positive for Spurs' ability to create havoc in the same vein.
Hello, Micky van de Ven.
He's not just a Rolls Royce in open play and with the ball - his power, pace, and timing make him an aerial asset waiting to be unlocked from attacking corners and free-kicks. In two starts under Frank, he's already amassed three shots and a goal against PSG.
He is 6/4 with Sky Bet to register at least one shot and while the markets remain sleeping on the true probability, he is a great bet to attack.
If you wanted some evidence about how much Brentford have potentially fallen in the summer, analysing their win price in the last meeting between these two clubs in March says a lot. The Bees, with Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and Yoane Wissa in tow, were 11/10 shots to beat Aston Villa at home.
They are priced up as 21/10 here just five months later, which indicates almost a five per cent implied probability shift.
That's massive when assessing outright prices.
They were utterly hopeless in the first half of their 3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest. First day nerves to blame? Or more a deeper underlying issue that this is a bigger rebuilding job than the club first imagined? I'm in the latter camp.
Sometimes in football betting, you just have to go back to basics.
Squad downgrade? Check. Squad imbalance? Check. Dangerous opponents who have one of the best managers in Europe? Check.
All signs point to a Bournemouth win over Wolves this weekend at 4/5 with Sky Bet - and this could be a bleak season for Vítor Pereira's men.
At home, with the crowd behind them and Wolves trying to implement Pereira's possession-based patterns under pressure, this game sets up nicely for Andoni Iraola's side and the fast and frenetic Bournemouth style. The Cherries may just squeeze Wolves into errors and feast on transitions. They may have lost a lot of quality in their dressing room but the most important man remains: Iraola - as shown by their performance at Anfield.
That's why they can be trusted to go again despite the squad overhaul.
The Premier League has become a league where pace, power, directness and ability to have real physicality off the ball is so key. This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.
I think Sunderland have noticed this trend and spent all summer planning to join the fast-break party because their recruitment has centred around bringing in big strong boys who either have lots of physical presence or carry great pace and power. They were so good on the break in the 3-0 win over West Ham. It was all about energy and progressive running.
Habib Diarra was the real star - this kid is powerful and full of direct running forward. Regis Le Bris gave him lots of license to support the front man and he fired in two shots, one of which was defined a big chance. He's 6/5 with Sky Bet to hit two or more shots again in a game Sunderland will be targeting three points from.
Beware: Declan Rice is a player I'll be rabbiting on about a lot this season.
Since moving to Arsenal, Rice has evolved into more than just a midfield shield. Under Mikel Arteta, he's given license to step into advanced pockets, recycle possession and let fly when space opens up. This positional change makes him a fantastic betting prospect in the attacking props markets.
Rice has covered his two or more shots line in his last six starts and boats an overall shots figure of 2.15 when playing in the No 8 role in 2025.
That figure should be capable of being hit against against a newly-promoted team, where Arsenal will dominate territory and Rice finds himself with time to test the 'keeper or pepper the goal. Combining Arsenal to win and Rice to have two or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet looks a nice angle to attack.
My first port of call whenever a key player leaves or suffers a serious injury is the with and without data to try and quantify how much a team will miss that player's output. Well, since the start of the 23/24 season, Eberechi Eze - on his way to Arsenal - hasn't started 21 games in the Premier League and in that time Palace's win percentage goes from 40 per cent to 19 per cent and their points per game drops from 1.5 to just 1.0 per game.
Oliver Glasner has a difficult job in keeping confidence and mentality levels high within his squad after losing such an important and well-liked player.
Forest are a trustworthy team as you know exactly what you're going to get in that they're very good in both boxes, and are led impeccably by Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo in defence - one of the best defensive pairings in Europe.
This looks a great time to head to Selhurst Park and the away win at 21/10 with Sky Bet does appeal.
One lazy narrative that has stuck out during the pre-season chat is how Everton could struggle without the fortress of Goodison Park and may suffer from new stadium nerves. However, the last five teams in the top two tiers of English football that have moved stadiums possess a healthy record across their first five games.
From those 25 games, they won 16 of them, losing just four.
The Hill Dickinson Stadium has been strategically built to keep the atmosphere hot and hostile and when Everton fans turn up the noise, they remain one of the most passionate set of fans in the country. Brighton are a team overrated by the markets in my view and the 19/10 with Sky Bet on Everton starting with a win at their new home looks a solid wager.
The market likes what it saw from Manchester United against Arsenal based on their win price here. They are 21/20 with Sky Bet although it doesn't feel like particularly smart money is driving the United price into what it is. They still looked very timid in central midfield without the ball and doubts remain about whether the wing-backs - a key cog in any 3-5-2 system - provide enough attacking output to turn United into a functional and exciting team.
I like backing Fulham when they are overlooked. Marco Silva's men are mostly ignored by the market but they took 30 of their 54 points last season against top-half teams. That's a huge return and one that made them very profitable to back as outsiders when the price was right. You can get 6/4 with Sky Bet here on Fulham on the draw no bet market meaning stakes are refunded if the game ends level.
Eddie Howe is doing a great job at using the Alexander Isak situation to bring the club together as best he can.
When St James' Park smells disrespect, it bites back. You can expect the atmosphere to be a bearpit on Monday. Every Liverpool touch booed. Newcastle players pumped to play aggressively from the first whistle as they look to utilise that hotbed of noise to their advantage.
And that's when the Toon are at their most dangerous.
Despite the win vs Bournemouth, Liverpool appeared more vulnerable on the break than last season as they faced more fast breaks (5) in that game than in any Premier League game at Anfield last season.
And Newcastle are built to counter-attack with a front three of Anthony Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes perfectly equipped to hit Liverpool in transition. The hosts look a great bet in the double chance market at 4/5 with Sky Bet.

Merson says: Palmer needs support - but stop him and you stop Chelsea,"Paul Merson called Chelsea's goalless draw with Crystal Palace on the opening weekend a ""concern"" and says West Ham will be aiming to shut down Cole Palmer to close off the Blues' creativity.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13414608/paul-merson-says-chelsea-a-worry-friday-night-football-bigger-for-enzo-marescas-blues-than-west-ham,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:00:00",Paul Merson,['Chelsea'],"Paul Merson called Chelsea's goalless draw with Crystal Palace on the opening weekend a ""concern"" and says West Ham will be aiming to shut down Cole Palmer to close off the Blues' creativity.
Read on as Merson discusses Chelsea's lack of cutting edge against Palace, Palmer's struggles and the improvements West Ham need to make...
The draw against Crystal Palace was worrying for Chelsea.
Chelsea were not good.
If Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.
He needs some support.
Palmer is the talk of the town in team talks against Chelsea. Teams are trying to stop him because they think stop him, stop Chelsea. Stop Cole Palmer will be the message for West Ham on Friday. That's just how it is.
Palmer also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.
It's hard for Palmer. You've got to have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.
It's not just all on Palmer because the coach has to come up with solutions, too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.
You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.
Palmer will miss Nicolas Jackson this season.
Jackson was a willing runner for Palmer, and he created so much space for him.
I know he was a bit messy with his play and he missed chances, but he was game. He had an ability to take defenders the other way and when you do that, it opens space for Palmer.
When you play like Palmer, you want as much space as you can, and Jackson helped provide that.
Now, Joao Pedro isn't really an out-and-out centre forward. He likes to come short too and that's not helpful for Palmer. If the middle of the pitch is suffocated, then it takes Palmer out of the equation.
I am not sure the decision to potentially move on Jackson is the right one. You have to remember how good Palmer was with Jackson. Jackson made Palmer and Palmer made Jackson.
I cannot believe Chelsea didn't go for Eberechi Eze.
I really don't know what I am missing.
They buy winger after winger, but they need guile. They need more than Palmer.
If you get Eze, you then have two players who can break teams down.
They are predictable for me. They play with two quick wingers, with Palmer trying to feed them.
I don't think coming up against Chelsea is a bad game for West Ham.
Of course, the defeat at Sunderland is a concern. They were extremely poor at the Stadium of Light, and you can understand the worry from the supporters.
The Hammers need more energy in midfield. They were overrun by Sunderland, who put in a good performance.
The game against West Ham is a bigger game for Chelsea, in my opinion.

Liverpool's Frimpong out until end of international break,Liverpool defender Jeremie Frimpong has been ruled out until after the September international break.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415711/jeremie-frimpong-injury-liverpool-defender-ruled-out-until-after-the-international-break-missing-games-against-newcastle-and-arsenal,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 14:43:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool defender Jeremie Frimpong has been ruled out until after the September international break.
The Dutch right-back - who limped off during the Premier League opener against Bournemouth - will miss Liverpool's crucial games against Newcastle on Monday, and Arsenal on the following Sunday. Both games are live on Sky Sports.
Liverpool boss Arne Slot said: ""The medical team was completely right about Jeremie, to tell me I had to take him off because he's out until the end of the international break.
""I think I got criticised a bit by taking him off. [The medical staff] felt he had an issue in his hamstring. Good call to take him off otherwise he might have been out for longer. We expect to have him back after the international break.""
Conor Bradley returned to training with the first team on Thursday while Joe Gomez is another right-back option in the squad - but Slot said he has not played a lot of minutes, raising doubts about his ability to start.
""Conor played for a few minutes with us today, for the first time,"" said Slot, who revealed Wataru Endo and Dominik Szoboszlai could also fit in at right-back. Curtis Jones has also slotted in at right-back before for Liverpool and England.
""These things happen in a season. We have only at the moment two injuries - unfortunately it's two for the same position,"" added Slot.
""The good thing is some others can play in that position as well. Wataru played in that position for a few minutes, Dominik Szoboszlai already played in that position. There are other options we can explore.
""Joe Gomez is definitely one of them. But for him to already play 20 minutes, that was already quite a lot. I wouldn't say he had a setback but he wasn't able to train three days in a row completely with the team. It's completely normal if you've been out for so long and all of a sudden the manager needs you for 20 minutes.
""He's training with the team so let's see where he is on Monday, if he can be involved in the team or if he can even start. But there are other options as well.
""You cannot prepare for two injuries in one position. It would be stupid for us to have three full-backs or five left-backs - although we have three left-backs!""
Sky Sports' Paul Merson on The Premier League Show:
""You worry for those two games coming up. The way they play, they let [Mohamed] Salah stay up top and he doesn't have to be tracking back.
""And now with Harvey Barnes probably playing out on that wing for Newcastle, then either Eberechi Eze or Gabriel Martinelli playing there the week after, they will have to get through those next two games.
""That gives the other two teams a chance.
""I was at the Community Shield the week before and I was worried about Liverpool defensively. Frimpong likes bombing forward and Salah is staying up the pitch. There's always going to be space down their right and the opposition's left. I worry for Liverpool down there.
""If Frimpong's injured and Bradley is fit - it's probably the right move for them in the next two games who have ammunition down that side of the pitch.
""Bradley isn't fit yet, Gomez has had a few injuries so it's only right you look after him. So it will be interesting. That's where you can hurt Liverpool, anywhere else I'm not too sure.""
Liverpool received some criticism for their defending in the season opener against Bournemouth, with Jamie Carragher calling it ""absolutely shocking"".
However, the Reds will be boosted by the return of midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who was suspended last Friday following a red card on the final day of last season.
""If he's the same player as he was last season that could help us a lot,"" said Slot of Gravenberch.
""If you look at the second goal we conceded [against Bournemouth] they could go from one side to the other side without being attacked. If you look back at last season, every single time Ryan played, he would have been in that position.
""For him not being there and us playing with very good players but very attacking-minded players, that for example hurt us in that goal. And that wasn't the first time where we lacked a player in that position in a counter-attack for the other team.""
Analysis by Sky Sports' Richard Morgan:
Liverpool head coach Arne Slot will have various options to pick from to replace the injured Jeremie Frimpong at right-back after the Netherlands international suffered a hamstring injury in the champions' opening-night win over Bournemouth, although none of them are ideal.
Frimpong will be out until after the international break, meaning Slot now needs cover for the upcoming Premier League games at Newcastle United on Monday Night Football, followed by the huge clash with title rivals Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday August 31.
Conor Bradley would be the natural choice, but the right-back has only just returned to training after his own hamstring issue saw him return early from the club's preseason tour of the Far East.
The experienced Joe Gomez, meanwhile, would be another option, but like Bradley, the versatile defender is also only just back from an Achilles injury that cut short his summer tour of Hong Kong and Japan. And while Gomez did come on for the final 18 minutes against Bournemouth, Slot indicated that Monday's trip to St James' Park may come too soon for him, at least to start the game.
And that could see the Dutchman having to convert a midfield player into a right-back, with the likes of Wataru Endo - who initially replaced Frimpong on Friday Night Football, before Gomez took over in the role - Dominik Szoboszlai, or most likely Curtis Jones - who was used there against Everton and Fulham during a similar injury crisis last April, while Thomas Tuchel also played him there in his first game as England boss - all candidates.
Unless, of course, Slot opts to try recent new centre-back signing Giovanni Leoni out in an unfamiliar right-back role, as he did with Jarell Quansah in last season's League Cup final loss to Newcastle at Wembley.
But whoever he goes for, trying to tame Newcastle's pacy left-sided forward Harvey Barnes under the St James' lights will be no easy task.

Eze expected to undergo medical ahead of move to Arsenal,Arsenal have agreed a &#163;67.5m deal to sign Eberechi Eze after hijacking Tottenham Hotspur's move for the Crystal Palace forward.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13390844/eberechi-eze-transfer-news-arsenal-agree-67-5m-deal-to-sign-crystal-palace-forward-after-hijacking-tottenham-move,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 08:00:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Arsenal have agreed a £67.5m deal to sign Eberechi Eze after hijacking Tottenham Hotspur's move for the Crystal Palace forward.
The Gunners will pay a guaranteed £60m plus £7.5m in add-ons for the forward, with personal terms now close to being totally agreed and a medical expected to take place on Friday.
The 27-year-old's release clause, worth £60m plus £8m in add-ons, expired before the Premier League season started.
Eze was absent from the Eagles squad as they beat Fredrikstad, in the first leg of their Conference League play-off at Selhurst Park on Thursday but was spotted at the ground after the game by Sky cameras.
Spurs felt they had an agreement in place with Palace and Eze on Wednesday before their north London rivals reignited their interest and swooped in following an injury to Kai Havertz.
Eze was one of a number of players Arsenal looked into in the first few weeks of the window, where, significantly, a lot of the work was carried out in June when they explored the conditions of a deal. Since then, their focus has been on other positions and player departures.
Spurs were considering offering Richarlison in a deal for Eze. That would have freed up striker space for them to try and sign Yoane Wissa, who played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Wissa still wants to join Newcastle, who had a second bid rejected on Wednesday.
Eze, who started in Palace's draw at Chelsea on Sunday, has two years left on his contract at Selhurst Park.
Arsenal have a long-standing interest in Eze, who was previously on the books of their academy and has said he was a supporter of the club growing up.
They explored a potential deal earlier in the window, but chose not to pursue a deal at that stage as they prioritised strengthening other areas of the squad and agreeing new contracts with existing players.
Spurs then came in for Eze after Morgan Gibbs-White chose to sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest and they lost James Maddison to an ACL injury.
Talks were held between Tottenham and Palace, and Spurs felt they had an agreement in place on Wednesday with club and the player.
However, Arsenal then came in to hijack the deal in a major twist on Wednesday evening.
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
Eberechi Eze is electric. The 27-year-old is a delight to watch with his poise and swagger on the ball and craft to open up defences, not to mention his penchant for scoring spectacular strikes himself.
He finished last season as one of the hottest prospects in the country, scoring in six games in a row, including both the FA Cup semi-final and final at Wembley as he helped inspire Crystal Palace to their first ever major honour.
Last season wasn't all plain sailing, though. ""I think Ebere has had a strange season,"" said Palace boss Glasner at the end of March. ""He hasn't had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going. He's also struggled with strange injuries.""
Those comments came after Eze had ignited Palace in an FA Cup tie at Fulham, scoring one and setting up another. That standout display came on the back of a first goal for England. Fit and full of confidence, Eze was back to his best during the run-in.
It is that livewire maverick Arsenal will hope can unlock deep defences and bring a spark to their previously at-times predictable patterns of attack. He offers something completely different to Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli, the current wide left options and Viktor Gyokeres will be relishing the prospect of latching onto the type of passes which have proved so productive for Jean-Philippe Mateta.
After being released by the Gunners as a 13-year-old, Eze will be motivated to seize a second-chance in north London - and, in his prime, he looks set to do just that and make a big impact for Mikel Arteta.
Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:
""Arsenal have pulled off a real coup here. At the last minute, they matched Spurs' offer, and it's important to remember Eze himself is an Arsenal supporter.
""His wish was very important in this - Arsenal matched Spurs' bid of £60m, including £7.5m in add-ons. Remember, he had a release clause which expired last week, which was worth up to £68m.
""Arsenal have been interested in signing him all summer and their fans were crying out for them to make a move for him.
""When you looked at how much business they had already done this summer you could suggest they had to sell before they brought in another player.
""Is this move motivated by the fact Kai Havertz picked up this injury at Old Trafford? Or have they been really smart and avoided getting involved in a bidding war, and knew he would choose Arsenal if he had a choice, and waited for Spurs to agree a deal before they turn up at the 11th hour and matched it. I think it's a bit of both.
""I have some sympathy for Spurs. This is not football manager, this is real life. I don't want to kick Spurs when they're down - I'm trying to see it from the perspective of their hierarchy.
""I think they did everything they could to try to sell the club to Eze. A lot of Spurs fans are asking why they didn't trigger his release clause before Friday, but maybe they tried to do that and the player could've dragged his feet. Maybe he was keeping his options open.
""Spurs fans are very angry and criticising Daniel Levy and the owners, but I think we should keep things in perspective; these kind of things happen all the time in the window.
""Ultimately, everyone knows Eze is an Arsenal fan, as are his whole family. He played for them until he was 13 when he was released.
""Why didn't Spurs trigger the release clause? It might've needed paying in one lump sum. They might've waited until it expired to get a better deal.""

'Reeking of desperation?' - who could Spurs turn to next?,BBC Sport looks at who Spurs might turn to in the transfer market after losing out on Eberechi Eze and finds out how the club's fans are feeling.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c987kgyw329o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:51:16",Umir Irfan,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"It's been a nightmare few days for Tottenham.
After reaching an agreement to sign England international Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace on Wednesday, they received the news that instead he is set to join bitter north London rivals Arsenal.
Spurs are in the market for a high quality attacking midfield reinforcement. James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski have both suffered serious injuries while Yves Bissouma missed the opening game of the season in the Premier League.
Earlier this summer, a proposed move for Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest fell through.
Fans have been speaking to BBC Sport to vent their frustration at the situation, with one saying: ""Spurs now enter the final few weeks of the transfer window reeking of desperation.""
However, another said: ""If he's a Gooner we don't want him. Simple.""
With less than two weeks of the window left, the options for Spurs in the transfer market are limited, but there are players that could prove to be smart targets should Spurs choose to pursue them.
It will be important to ensure any new midfield signing is physical, a good carrier of the ball over distance, technically secure when deeper, and a strong passer.
BBC Sport looks at Spurs' possible transfer options and speaks to fans to analyse the situation.
Who could Spurs target?
Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford)
Spurs boss Thomas Frank's former midfielder was pivotal to Brentford last season, with two goals and 10 assists. In describing what Frank may be looking for in his attacking midfielder, there isn't a better place to look than the Denmark international.
Damsgaard provided Frank with solutions to their build-up play, frequently dropping into wide areas, deeper. Opposition defenders were unsure whether or not to follow him into these areas and Brentford could get up the pitch more often.
He would help Brentford with smart passes to the wingers or turning on the ball and driving with it himself. When under pressure, he would bounce it back to a defender with a first-time pass, not taking unnecessary risks.
By playing well-weighted direct through balls often, Damsgaard was a large factor in Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo's goal output.
Off the ball, Damsgaard pressed in a front two, intercepting the ball in dangerous situations. His pressing intensity and willingness to defend embodied the culture Frank has tried to instil in his teams throughout his career.
Although slightly on the nose, the well-rounded midfielder would slot into Frank's system at Spurs with ease. The familiarity ensures questions about tactical fit are a non-issue.
At only 25 years old, he combines experience, Premier League know-how and technical and physical quality, allowing him to scale up to a Champions League side.
Bilal El Khannouss (Leicester)
It is important to contextualise El Khannouss' Premier League performances and statistics, given he played for a poor Leicester side who spent large parts of last season defending deep.
Although he only scored two goals and assisted three times in the league, his performances have caught the eye of teams in the Premier League, most recently being linked to Crystal Palace as a potential Eze replacement.
What stands out immediately is his technical quality. El Khannouss is accomplished with both feet and is often seen playing passes and crosses with either, depending on what flank he has floated towards.
The manner in which he dropped as deep as the defensive midfielders, to improve the Foxes' build-up, is something Frank would appreciate. In these situations, he would carry his team upfield using deceptive feints to create space from opponents pressing him.
Although El Khannouss is an attacking midfielder, he often found himself in wing positions and showcased great crossing quality and high-level ball manipulation.
He has good pace in big spaces but on the ball plays at a slower pace appropriately. His two-footedness provides balance and additional creative solutions alongside left-footed wingers.
The only real question mark in his game is how quickly he gets his shots off. He has a powerful strike of the ball and is excellent on set-pieces but takes time to set up his shot, leading to his strikes being blocked. This makes scoring for El Khannouss more difficult in crowded spaces, but he should be a threat when shooting from distance.
Maghnes Akliouche (Monaco)
Akliouche, just like Eze, is a natural winger who moves to play more centrally during the game. With five goals and 10 assists in Ligue 1 last season, the Frenchman took a step up, although he underperformed against his expected goals total of 9.3.
Even as a winger, he has a tendency to drop deep. From such areas, he can drive the ball over large distances quickly, showing strength to hold off defenders. His ball manipulation is impressive, often using his studs and ball rolls to confuse defenders.
Against deep defences, the Monaco winger has been seen moving into central midfield positions to find solutions. Here he passes well and can find team-mates at a variety of angles. As a talented passer, he would help to provide balance to Spurs' group of impressive ball carriers.
Despite his on-the-ball quality, he doesn't neglect his off-the-ball work. He tracks back diligently if his team have lost the ball. In attack, he makes good runs behind the opposition's back line.
Frank likes his versatile attackers, particularly those that can play multiple roles. Akliouche provides a different profile down the middle and would work well with Porro on the right flank. This would free Kudus to play centrally too.
Akliouche displays a goal threat greater than the rest of the names in this list. However, he is the most naturally attacking player, playing in a more dominant side compared to Brentford and Leicester.
Tyler Dibling (Southampton)
Like Eze, Dibling is a winger who can play centrally. For Southampton last season, there were games in which he stayed fairly central.
As a winger, Dibling resists pressure well from defenders on his back, getting used to being closely marked in the Premier League with pressure from behind him. He takes this quality with him when playing in midfield.
When starting centrally, he often dropped deep and towards the right side of the pitch to provide his team's defenders with an extra passing option. To find space in these situations, he would fake to run in behind, dragging a midfielder with him, before dropping deep quickly to receive the ball.
If there is the opportunity to turn with the ball, the Englishman does so and impressively avoids being tackled by riding contact well over large distances and having quick feet in small spaces.
He can be less active than others on this list when he doesn't have the ball and prefers to receive the ball to feet, rather than making runs behind a defender.
At times, Dibling would suit playing down the middle more than on the wing if he were to sign for Spurs.
Down the middle, he is able to showcase his ability to shift the ball and shoot quickly. Out wide, he can be susceptible to not quite getting the right flight on in-swinging crosses from the right flank, a method of chance creation that Frank likes to use.
'Selling clubs know how to squeeze us' - Spurs fan reaction
By Bardi, fan writer from The Extra Inch, external
Daniel Levy's reign has seen an upturn in fortune and fortunes at Spurs, but they still seem unable to compete and complete transfers.
With Morgan Gibbs-White's move to Spurs in pieces, Eze seemed the next logical step, especially with top-four rivals out of the equation, but somehow Levy and Spurs failed to get it over the line.
Who moved the line depends on where you stand in the great Levy debate, but what's clear is that he seems unable to work with other Premier League clubs.
Premier League chairmen know what to expect from him. They expect to be ""drawn over the coals"" and they've had enough.
Eze was probably not the player we needed. He's not a high-volume creative passer or a dribbling sensation, but he represented far more than that. He's a player at the peak of his powers, and his signature would be a statement of intent. It would also ultimately deny Arsenal a player they coveted.
Spurs now enter the final few weeks of the window reeking of desperation. Selling clubs know what we're holding and how to squeeze us. We have no other option but to pay what they want.
A selection of fan responses to BBC Sport on Thursday
Brian: Totally embarrassing. Over a week to get Eze signed and still couldn't manage it and Arsenal do it in hours. A kick in the teeth to Spurs fans. We spend so much wasted time on negotiating deals, it's pure frustration!
Bob: Can't say I'm that bothered. He is 27 years old and his career so far has been QPR and Palace. He's not been wanted by anyone like Barca or Real - move on.
Ian: Spurs' mentality is like being a multi-millionaire and driving 25 minutes out of town because the petrol is 5p cheaper. By the time you get home you haven't saved anything, wasted a bunch of time, and everyone else is confused by what you're doing and laughing at you.
Andre: Eze is a fantastic player and would strengthen any team he plays for. But, we can't look back. He isn't a Spurs player so let's not cry about him. Onwards and upwards!
Christopher: Can't help but feel that Ange would've sounded Eze out and identified if his heart was in joining THFC or if he was stringing them along. If anything, it would have prevented this song and dance from playing out at Levy's Tottenham.
Anthony: Completely get it from Eze's perspective, it's his boyhood club. For me, it's another case of Levy and co. taking far too long to wrap something up. Realistically this only reportedly happened because of Havertz's injury, but in football you should never take anything for granted. Not sure where to go now, put the extra funds towards Savinho and find another 10 quick.
Bob: If he's a Gooner we don't want him. Simple.
Mark: For once I don't think we can blame Levy for dragging his heels on this outcome. I don't think Eze ever wanted to sign for us, all we did was set it up for Arsenal to step in. Fair play to their buying team and no doubt our smug North London neighbours will be letting us know how good they feel.

Sutton's predictions v Wolf Alice bassist Theo Ellis and AI,BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Wolf Alice bassist and Arsenal fan Theo Ellis with his predictions for this weekend's Premier League fixtures.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8jpw87pwxyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:11:00",,['Arsenal'],"The Premier League returns for another mouth-watering weekend of football with Newcastle v Liverpool on Monday night being the pick of the fixtures.
BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.
He was the prediction winner last weekend and told BBC Sport this week: ""It's a huge relief to get that first win.
""I even got the better of AI too. I've always said, you'll need more than just artificial intelligence to beat me.""
For week two, he takes on Wolf Alice bassist Theo Ellis, who supports Arsenal.
Wolf Alice's new album The Clearing is out on Friday and they tour the UK in November and December.

The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Ellis grew up in north London and is a lifelong Arsenal fan who started going to the club's former home Highbury as a young boy.
""That time was wasted on me a little bit,"" he told BBC Sport.
""Well, not exactly wasted because it is some of my best memories ever, but I was going to watch 'The Invincibles' play some of the greatest football ever and I was too young to appreciate it fully.
""Then as I got older, in my caring years, unfortunately I was put through the Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi era instead.
""It's very different now, though. I love so many aspects of this team, from the Hale End graduates like Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly to the type of football we play.
""Despite not winning anything for a while, it has been a joy to watch us. That's the best bit, the football, and it's the heartbreak that keeps you coming back for more.""

Premier League predictions
Friday, 22 August
London Stadium, 20:00 BST
West Ham were as flat as anything at Sunderland. My colleague Ian Dennis on BBC Radio 5 Live called them anaemic. I'm a little bit worried for them this season.
I was at Chelsea's last game against Crystal Palace and I thought they also lacked that spark.
A lot has been made about Chelsea's new attack. Joao Pedro was quiet, Cole Palmer was quiet. There's a stat going around that Palmer hasn't scored a league goal from open play since January.
West Ham might prove me wrong, it is a London derby after all, but I still think Chelsea will find a way to edge it.
Sutton's prediction: 0-2
Theo's prediction: I don't have high hopes for West Ham this season. 0-3
AI's prediction: 1-2
Saturday, 23 August
Etihad Stadium, 12:30 BST
Manchester City really impressed me last week and everyone is rightly talking about Tijjani Reijnders. Statman Dave told me to get him into my Fantasy team, I didn't take that advice and I should've done. He was brilliant against Wolves.
I do think Tottenham will be a level above under Thomas Frank. It'll be interesting how they set up. They played a back three in the Super Cup final against Paris St-Germain.
Cristian Romero has signed a new contract for Tottenham, that's a big deal. But how did they not get a deal for Eberechi Eze over the line? It had been going on for weeks and now Arsenal have come in and embarrassed them!
Tottenham are still a few players short from properly challenging the really big teams and in this game I think City at home will be too strong for them.
Sutton's prediction: 2-1
Theo's prediction: City to score five and Erling Haaland is going to bag four of them. 5-0
AI's prediction: 3-1
Vitality Stadium, 15:00 BST
I really liked Bournemouth having a go at Liverpool. I know they ended up losing but they always carry that attacking threat. They're so good in transition and get bodies forward.
How do you judge Wolves after they got walloped at home against Manchester City? I mean, they did have chances in that match.
There's also that concern as to whether Bournemouth have properly replaced their three best defenders who they sold this summer.
It'll be quite tight, I know AI will go for a draw because they're very predictable. But I'm going to stick my neck out. Bournemouth will sneak it.
Sutton's prediction: 1-0
Theo's prediction: Bournemouth got raided in the summer but they still have Antoine Semenyo and I love watching him play. He is going to score at least one here, too. 2-1
AI's prediction: 2-0
Gtech Community Stadium, 15:00 BST
Brentford under Keith Andrews were really disappointing in their opener, conceding after just a couple of minutes against Nottingham Forest.
It doesn't bode well, in fact I'm worried about Brentford. They've lost all the goals of Bryan Mbeumo while Yoane Wissa has seemingly downed tools and doesn't want to play.
They still have battle-hardened players with Premier League experience, but they need that first win under their belt to get that real belief in their new head coach.
I though Villa were really stale against Newcastle and were lucky to get a point.
But I'm going to pick them to bounce back. I think Ollie Watkins will score against his old club.
Sutton's prediction: 1-2
Theo's prediction: Brentford have lost too many good players and I think they could go down this season. Villa are a top-six team and they will have too much for them. 1-3
AI's prediction: 1-2
Turf Moor, 15:00 BST
I wrote Sunderland off months ago at the end of last season but they surprised me last week with a hell of a win against West Ham.
Those two headers from Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard were absolutely brilliant and they deserved their victory.
Burnley had their moments against Tottenham but didn't take them. They'll need to get a foothold in this season sooner rather than later.
This one stinks of a draw. I think it'll be close and Burnley will want more but Sunderland will be satisfied with their start.
Sutton's prediction: 1-1
Theo's prediction: This is a proper game! It's massive for whoever wins. If Sunderland are in their cool black away kit and Granit Xhaka decides to power up then maybe they could win this, but Burnley are at home so I am backing them - proper Turf Moor vibes like they had under Sean Dyche.
I really want to meet Dyche by the way - I've heard he likes indie music and goes to a lot of gigs, especially in Nottingham where he lives. Sean, if you are reading this, we are playing Nottingham Arena in December - we will put you on the guest list if you want to come. 1-0
AI's prediction: 2-2
Emirates Stadium, 17:30 BST
I didn't feel Arsenal's performance was there against Manchester United but still, at least they found a way to win.
All the talk in this game is going to be about Viktor Gyokeres and whether he can get off the mark. There was such an overreaction after he didn't score against Man United.
He's been written off as a dud in some quarters already! That's the modern game, you can get written off after your first hour of playing in the Premier League.
Not me though, no, I think he'll come good.
Leeds played with such intensity against Everton, although the penalty they won was slightly harsh.
Will Daniel Farke's side show that same level of bravery at the Emirates? Probably, and if so it'll cost them.
Sutton's prediction: 4-0
Theo's prediction: 2-0
Theo on Arsenal's title hopes: It feels like the pressure is unbearable at our club. I don't think we handle pressure well and we constantly want to win absolutely everything. But of course I think we can win the league this season. I feel like if it's going to happen any time, then it will be now.
I am glad Leeds are back in the Premier League. I miss Marcelo Bielsa Leeds, when they played chaos-ball - that was my favourite. But, look, I am an Arsenal fan so we are going to win this. Declan Rice to open the scoring from a long way out and Ethan Nwaneri to get the other in the 73rd minute. 2-0
AI's prediction: 4-1
Sunday, 24 August
Selhurst Park, 14:00 BST
Watching Palace last week against Chelsea I thought they deserved to win the game. I love the way they play, the back three are phenomenal, they're a really good team.
The problem for Palace is that their squad is so thin without their stars. How do you replace a player like Eberechi Eze, for example?
Losing Eze and Marc Guehi is a massive part of the team gone. It'll leave a huge hole and completely changes how I'll be predicting them this season.
As for this game, I reckon it'll be another close one. Nottingham Forest also had a great result in their opener.
Sutton's prediction: 1-1
Theo's prediction: I absolutely love Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White. Palace are great so maybe they get something but I am going to say Forest - that's for my friend Keane Shaw. He has designed some of the Forest kits and is a lifelong fan so I will dedicate that win to him. 1-2
AI's prediction: 1-1
Hill Dickinson Stadium, 14:00 BST
I've said this on many occasions. Everton overachieved last season. It's painted a false picture as to where they currently are.
They didn't offer a lot the other night against Leeds. Sorry Everton fans but I've just got a feeling Brighton will play party poopers in the first Premier League game at Everton's new stadium.
Sutton's prediction: 1-2
Theo's prediction: I would love if Everton just let Jack Grealish play wherever he wants in a completely free role. This is their first game at their new stadium so they are definitely going to win it and Grealish is going to score a hat-trick. 3-1
AI's prediction: 1-2
Craven Cottage, 16:30 BST
Like a lot of people, I try to be balanced about Manchester United. They lost last week but I do think they will be better this season. Well, they can't be any worse.
I really like Bryan Mbeumo and I especially like Matheus Cunha, I think he's got loads going for him.
Fulham were fortunate to get something against Brighton but I think they'll improve in front of their own fans.
Fulham don't play with any fear and will take the game to Manchester United which gives me a sneaking feeling United will exploit them and win this one.
But then again I always predict Manchester United games wrong. I want to be positive about them but I'm not sure I can be. Plus, I think I predicted Fulham wrong for every one of their matches last season.
I'm leaning towards a Manchester United win so, because of that, I'll go for a draw.
Sutton's prediction: 1-1
Theo's prediction: I like Fulham because of all their old Arsenal players but I can see United winning this. 1-2
AI's prediction: 0-2
Monday, 25 August
St James' Park, 20:00 BST
This match was going to be intense anyway, but the Alexander Isak transfer saga has ramped it up a notch. There's going to be an edge to this one and honestly anything could happen.
Newcastle go into this game hampered by the fact they don't have a number nine.  Isak hasn't covered himself. Newcastle were brilliant against Villa but guess what, they missed a centre-forward.
A lot has been made about Liverpool's defence, they conceded a couple of soft ones against Bournemouth so there'll be a worry there. But then you look at Liverpool's attack and you think, blimey.
Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike, who had a blinder of a debut and Newcastle wanted to sign. Funnily enough, had Newcastle got Ekitike then Isak would probably be at Liverpool.
There'll be goals in this. Neither of these sides take a backwards step. I veer towards Liverpool solely because Newcastle don't have a centre-forward. But, are they still capable of scoring goals? Absolutely.
Sutton's prediction: 1-2
Theo's prediction: St James' Park is a formidable place so I am going for a draw. 2-2
AI's prediction: 2-3
How did Sutton do last week?
It was a winning start to the season for Chris who got five correct results with one exact score from the 10 Premier League games he predicted in week one, giving him a total of 80 points.
The BBC readers came second - you got six correct results with no exact scores, giving you 60 points.
Guest, singer Tom Grennan, and AI both got five correct results with no exact scores, to leave them joint-third on 50 points.

Is Reijnders a must-have? The FPL talking point,"In Fantasy Premier League gameweek one, Tijjani Reijnders scored and assisted in Manchester City's 4-0 win over Wolves - earning 10 points for those who picked him. Should he be in your team?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c70xn0l3gzlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 05:58:54",,['Manchester City'],"Tijjani Reijnders' superb debut for Manchester City is the big talking point among Fantasy Premier League managers.
The midfielder (£5.6m) scored and assisted in City's 4-0 win over Wolves to earn those lucky enough to have picked him a solid 10 points.
After just one gameweek, and still at a low price, is he already a Fantasy must-have?
FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the guys from The FPL Podcast by BBC Sport debate this week's FPL talking point.
'You've got to have him' - the case for Reijnders
Statman Dave: You should be looking at Reijnders. If he plays for Manchester City consistently for the entire season, he's going to score a minimum of 10 goals in the Premier League, potentially 15. He's just someone that you want to get in your team - the spaces he plays in are perfect. Kevin de Bruyne is gone - he's basically playing that same area.
John Acres: If I didn't have him I think I would have jumped before his price rise. He just looks set, doesn't he? He just looks he looks like you've got to have him. And it feels like by the time we get to gameweek six or seven, everyone will have him.
Gianni Buttice: Before Manchester City's pre-season match against Palermo, where Reijnders scored twice in his 45-minute cameo, the Dutchman was under 5% owned in FPL. He now goes in to this weekend's fixtures in one of every three teams.
AC Milan fans would have been shocked to see FPL price the Dutchman at £5.5m. The Serie A's midfielder of the year scored 10 goals and earned five assists in the league last season for what was a poor Milan side that finished outside of the European places.
'Be aware of Guardiola rotation' - the case against
Gianni Buttice: Buying Reijnders seems to be the only thing FPL managers can agree on heading into this week, and rightly so. But, in the interest of balance, here are the, albeit few, reasons why you may want to hesitate before transferring him in.
Pep Guardiola goes through phases of 'flavour of the month' with his attacking players, midfielders and wide forwards. After arriving in January, Omar Marmoush started 14 of 16 league games last season. He was chucked straight in to the XI and hit the ground running, just like Reijnders. Then, in a surprise to many, Guardiola didn't pick the 10%-owned versatile attacker against Wolves.
With the Champions League not far off, some will also worry about rotation of Reijnders, with Guardiola having so many midfield options. But from what we have seen so far, and what we saw at AC Milan, Reijnders will likely keep his performances sky high.

How Arsenal won the signing of Eze and where he could fit in,"An Arsenal fan as a boy, Eberechi Eze is set to reject rivals Tottenham and join the Gunners. But how has the move happened?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c754kq0e32wo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:03:22",Alex Howell,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","The expected signing of Eberechi Eze has completely changed the feeling of the transfer window for Arsenal supporters.
The Gunners have been busy and aggressive in this window, signing six players for around £190m before the Premier League season even kicked off.
The arrivals included £64m striker Viktor Gyokeres and midfielder Martin Zubimendi for around £60m, but it is the deal for England international Eze that has supporters feeling like they have won the window.
A huge factor is trumping their rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who had agreed terms with both Crystal Palace and the player hours before the Gunners swooped.
How Arsenal won Eze race
It all happened in a few whirlwind hours.
Earlier on Wednesday, it looked as though the 27-year-old Eze would be heading to the white side of north London.
But the deal was not completed.
And the reason was Palace's Europa Conference League play-off match with Fredrikstad on Thursday.
The Eagles wanted to keep Eze for a game they view as pivotal to their season, and one they did not want to tackle without having a replacement in place.
Palace manager Oliver Glasner was strong in his pre-match press conference when saying that Eze and Marc Guehi, who has also been linked with a move away, were ""committed"" to the team.
Over at Emirates Stadium, a subplot was brewing.
Arsenal were holding an open training session at their ground which did not feature Kai Havertz. It was later revealed the Germany international was being assessed for a knee injury.
Despite the exact severity of the injury being unclear, Arsenal knew enough to make a move.
Hours later on Wednesday afternoon, Arsenal bid for Eze, deciding to act on their long-standing interest in the player.
With Eze being a boyhood Arsenal fan who played in their academy, it was an easy decision for the player.
By 19:30 BST, news of the surprise transfer emerged in the media, with sources briefing that there was nothing Spurs could have done to make the transfer happen due to that emotional connection.
And that element - Eze turning down Tottenham - is sure to make him an instant fan favourite at Arsenal.
But why did they leave it so late?
Arsenal had seen Eze as more of a number 10 and, with Ethan Nwaneri securing his future to the club with a long-term contract, they had to think carefully about exactly how the England international would fit in.
But it seems the Havertz injury meant they decided he was needed in their squad after all.
Eze did not play in the Europa Conference play-off for Palace on Thursday, with Glasner saying the player had called him to say he was unwell.
He is certain to sign for the Gunners in the next few days, completing a full-circle moment in re-joining the club he was released by at 13.
Where will Eze fit at Arsenal?
The big question for Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is this - where does Eze fit into the Arsenal team?
The forward is one of the last few players you could describe as being a maverick.
But that is what makes this signing make sense for Arsenal.
The Gunners have struggled to break down low blocks in the past and are implementing a new style this season which will see them move the ball quicker through the lines.
Eze is very different to all of the other forwards that Arsenal have and will provide a different option.
Of course, captain Martin Odegaard will be a hard player to shift from the number 10 role.
But the purchase of Eze adds to the range of options that teams who want to win the title might crave.
The Arsenal left wing position is probably the one that is most up for grabs.
Gabriel Martinelli had an up-and-down season last campaign and injury did not help things.
BBC Sport tactics correspondent Umir Irfan said: ""Eze will likely play frequently on the left wing, given Martinelli's recent form.
""Eze is able to thrive in more central areas from here if Arsenal's left-back was to push up the pitch.
""Eze's ability to play well with nearby team-mates in congested areas make him a smart choice if used in this way.
""His top carrying and passing quality in transition makes Eze an optimal option in end-to-end games, with Gyokeres up top.
""For games in which additional attacking threat is required, both Odegaard and Eze could play together as attacking midfielders.
""Off the ball, he slots in naturally as a left midfielder as Arsenal defend in a 4-4-2. This is done most easily when he starts from the left wing.""
How fans feel about the signing
In an interview with BBC Sport in May, Eze said the reason he plays how he does is for the ""people who are watching"" and that he likes to get ""fans off their feet"".
And that is a message that every supporter wants to hear.
Eze was hugely popular in both the dressing room and the stands at Palace. He has scored 40 goals and provided 28 assists in 169 appearances for the club, with his most memorable contribution being the winning goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City in May.
It is a sign of a much-loved player who has given good times to supporters that it will be hard to find any Palace fan who begrudges him the move for how he has played and what he has done.
For Arsenal supporters, he has already won the affection of the fanbase by turning down their fierce rivals to sign for a club that he supported as a boy.
When Eze posted a swipe of celebration pictures on his Instagram account after winning the FA Cup, he included a picture of Ian Wright playing in the FA Cup final for Palace.
Eze had the same retro Palace shirt on as Wright and is now going to follow in the footsteps of the Eagles hero who became a fan favourite at Arsenal - and will hope that he can achieve that status himself.

Why has a Liverpool song about Chiesa caused debate?,BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team take a look at why Federico Chiesa's song has caused debates among Liverpool supporters.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyj92enpjko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:34:15",,['Liverpool'],"A song Liverpool supporters have dedicated to Federico Chiesa has sparked debate, after some said they felt it was offensive to Juventus fans.
Chiesa, 27, came off the substitutes' bench to score as Liverpool beat Bournemouth 4-2 on the opening night of the Premier League season.
That further solidified his cult-hero status among Reds fans despite an injury-hit first season after a £10m move from Juventus a year ago.
But why has the song he is serenaded with split opinion?
What are the lyrics?
Sung to the tune of Sway by Dean Martin, the lyrics are:
""We can hear them crying in Turin,
""Federico, he's here to win.
""One chat with Arne Slot and he said 'ciao',
""[Expletive] Juve, I'm a Kopite now.""
Why has the song caused debate?
Some see the reference to 'crying in Turin' as sensitive because it could be perceived to be linked to the Heysel Stadium disaster.
Heysel hosted the 1985 European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus, who are based in Turin. Before the match, 39 people died and 600 were injured when, after crowd trouble, fans were crushed against a wall that then collapsed.
Among those killed were 32 Italians, four Belgians, two French fans and one from Northern Ireland.
Because of that, Liverpool fan Tony Evans - a former football editor of the Times - said the 'crying in Turin' reference was ""tone deaf"" and ""pathetic"".
The Athletic's senior football writer Simon Hughes, meanwhile, said the song made him uncomfortable.
Juventus have not made a complaint about the song.
What has Chiesa said about the song?
Speaking after the victory over Bournemouth, Chiesa said he was ""grateful"" the fans were singing the song for him, though he was not asked specifically about the lyrics.
What do Liverpool fans think?
It is a catchy tune, but one that has not come without criticism.
For some supporters, the lines about Turin and Juventus are too pointed, as Liverpool has had a complicated relationship with them since Heysel.
To others this is a light-hearted song - purely about a footballer who was dumped by a club he had starred for, and how he had found a new home on Merseyside.
While I can see and understand arguments for the former, the song has already been sung for months. It's meant to be funny because everyone knows Juventus wanted to get rid of Chiesa, so any insinuations in their direction are poking fun at that.
I haven't seen anything online from Juventus supporters being upset about it, or it being equated to tragedy chanting.
Heysel is a stain on the club's history and an incident that should not be ignored, as it remains a flashpoint of football's hooliganism problem that has dissipated from those days, and should stay firmly in the past.
Tongue-in-cheek lines about footballers leaving them behind to join our ranks should not be conflated with a tragedy chanting issue that still plagues football in the modern day.
Respect for all opinions and positions should be paramount, but it has helped Chiesa feel at home on Merseyside. For that reason, I'd say it is doing more good than harm.
It is not an easy answer.
When the song first popped up at the beginning of last season, it was used sparingly given Chiesa barely played.
It was sung in an almost tongue-in-cheek fashion, given how little Arne Slot seemed to rate the Italian.
I was at the Premier League title-winning parade and it was sung more than Mohamed Salah's tune.  It's a really good football chant, with no context considered.
Is it offensive? I don't really think Liverpool fans are the right people to ask. Ask Juventus fans.
If they hear the lyrics and feel some anger or hurt, that is their right - just like it's not for non-Liverpool fans to claim the 'victims' chant is not offensive.
If I heard a supporters' group for Juve speak out against it, I would be less comfortable singing it.
I think intention is key here. When the song started, it was made up by young lads who were not around 40 years ago when Heysel happened.
There is no intention at all to reference that disaster in a mocking way - and the fact Chiesa himself said he loved the song, and joined in at the end of last season, suggests there is no ambition to hurt.
I probably won't sing it any more because the discussion has tarnished its good-humoured essence anyway. Many will, which is their right.

Liverpool's Frimpong out until after international break,New Liverpool right-back Jeremie Frimpong is ruled out until after the international break with a hamstring injury.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgm2endg7e0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:42:09",Lorraine McKenna,['Liverpool'],"New Liverpool right-back Jeremie Frimpong has been ruled out of action until after the international break with a hamstring injury.
Frimpong, 24, was substituted on his Premier League debut as the Reds beat Bournemouth 4-2 in their opening top-flight game last week.
He will miss league games against Newcastle United at St James' Park on Monday and against Arsenal at Anfield a week on Sunday.
Liverpool head coach Arne Slot said medical staff advised him to take Frimpong off because they felt the Netherlands international was struggling.
""I think I got criticised for taking him off, didn't I?"" Slot joked in his pre-match news conference on Thursday.
""It had nothing to do with how he played, but we felt he had an issue with his hamstring - and by we, I mean the medical staff. It was a good call to take him off.
""We expect to have him back after the international break.""
The first international break of the season is from 1-9 September, with the Premier League returning on the weekend of 13-14 September when Liverpool face Burnley at Turf Moor on the Sunday.
The injury to Frimpong leaves Slot short on options at right-back.
Frimpong was signed from Bayer Leverkusen for £29.5m in May to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold, who left to join Real Madrid.
Northern Ireland defender Conor Bradley only returned to first-team training on Thursday, while Slot said Joe Gomez, who has suffered long injury lay-offs during his career, was unable to train for three days in a row after replacing striker Hugo Ekitike late on against the Cherries.
""Jeremie [Frimpong] has a very positive injury record. Conor [Bradley] was out once or twice last season. These things happen,"" said Slot.
""At the moment, we only have two injuries, but unfortunately it is two in the same position. The good thing is we have other players that can play there. Wataru Endo played there, Dominik Szoboszlai also.
""Joe Gomez is definitely one of them, but for him to already play 20 minutes - that is already quite a lot.
""He is training with the team, so let's see where he is and if he can be involved on Monday. You cannot prepare for two injuries in one position.""

"Silly to quit Man Utd now, says defender Maguire","Manchester United defender Harry Maguire says he would be ""silly"" to leave a club he feels are on the up.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czerxw4p1xjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:01:05",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United blocked any chance of Harry Maguire leaving the club this summer - but the defender feels it would be ""silly"" to want to quit now anyway.
United triggered an option on Maguire's contract in January, keeping him at Old Trafford for a further year, at a point when head coach Ruben Amorim said his squad was ""starved of leaders"".
There have been instances in the past of extensions being granted purely to ensure United could still get a fee for a player if they were sold.
This was not one of those occasions.
Maguire says there was interest in him this summer. However, United's hierarchy made it clear he wasn't leaving.
""Last year, the clause was in their hands,"" he said. ""There was no option for me there. There was no talking. It was just they activated it and it got extended.
""I'm pretty sure the club made it clear this summer that I can't leave on any terms. A a couple of clubs enquired and I think they got a quick response.""
It does mean Maguire's contract now expires next summer, allowing him to talk to other clubs in January.
He rejected the idea of joining West Ham two summers ago after United accepted a bid for him.
The 32-year-old, who cost £80m when he joined United from Leicester in 2019, has an idea of his preferred option, but is keeping quiet on that for now.
However, he can feel the revolution going on behind the scenes since Sir Jim Ratcliffe bought into the club as minority shareholder at the end of 2023.
And while last season was their worst in the league since their relegation year in 1973-74 - and they opened the new campaign with a 1-0 home defeat by Arsenal - Maguire feels the club are in their best place since he arrived.
""I'm sure over the next few months we'll have to have a conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend,"" he said.
""Obviously, I have something in my mind about what I want to do and where I want to be.
""I don't want to put it out there to everybody but it's an amazing club to play for and you'd be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could.
""The hierarchy has come in, with [technical director] Jason [Wilcox] and the manager, and I feel like they're taking it in the right direction.
""Since I started six years ago to now, it's in a completely different place in terms of the structure behind the management staff.
""We're in a good place. A lot better place.""

Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend,"Spurs must forget Eze humiliation, Isak will be all the talk on Tyneside and Everton begin a new era at Hill Dickinson",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/22/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 23:00:16",Guardian sport,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester City', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Acheampong can step in for Colwill
Enzo Maresca’s request for Chelsea to replace the injured Levi Colwill with a new centre-back remains unanswered. The club’s position is straightforward: there are no suitable defenders on the market and, in any case, it is up to Maresca to find internal solutions. The Italian can call upon Josh Acheampong, who performed well against Crystal Palace on the opening weekend. The 19-year-old started with Colwill’s long-term absence complicated by Tosin Adarabioyo’s minor injury. Adarabioyo may return for Friday night at West Ham but there is a case to give Acheampong another chance next to Trevoh Chalobah. Acheampong, who counts Manchester City as one of his many suitors, stood up to Jean-Phillipe Mateta in the goalless draw with Palace. It is worth having another look at whether he can cope as the central centre-back when Chelsea morph into a back three in possession. Replacing Colwill’s line-breaking passes will not be easy but Maresca has options. Jacob Steinberg

Spurs must put Eze behind them
Tottenham ride into the Etihad Stadium in the wake of the Eberechi Eze farrago. Perhaps Thomas Frank can use the crimson embarrassment of Arsenal gazumping his club for the Crystal Palace forward’s signature to inspire his men. Last November, under Ange Postecoglou, Spurs trounced Pep Guardiola’s champions 4-0. A repeat may seem unlikely given Eze’s morale-sapping choice plus Manchester City’s 4-0 opening-day victory at Wolves. However, Frank and his players’ job is to be able to show fight and spirit and tenacity precisely when it is difficult. So at lunchtime on Saturday, we will find out how much of these qualities they possess. Jamie Jackson

Brentford look to Damsgaard for inspiration
Things started appallingly for Keith Andrews in his new life as Brentford head coach. In the first 45 minutes of his senior managerial career, the Bees showed no identity to make life easy for Nottingham Forest. Clearly, the lack of Yoane Wissa and the failure to replace Bryan Mbeumo will cause problems but a key absence in the East Midlands was Mikkel Damsgaard, missing after his wife gave birth. Andrews spoke of his importance to the team; unsurprising because he won of the players’ and fans’ player of the year award last season. The Dane’s return to the midfield will be imperative because Elliot Anderson and Morgan Gibbs-White dominated proceedings, unthreatened by anything akin to pressing. Alongside Damsgaard, Jordan Henderson may start after coming off the bench for his debut on Sunday. Experience will be helpful to Andrews, because he lacks it as a coach. Brentford were certainly better in the second half at Forest and the greater assurance of Damsgaard and Henderson can help their colleagues settle and forget that poor start. Will Unwin

Burnley need a goal threat
This feels like a game Burnley need to win already. The Clarets conceded almost a third of the entire tally of their goals-against column last season at Tottenham last weekend. Burnley were always going to be more porous at the back by the nature of stepping into the Premier League but on that basis, they need to find goals at the other end. Last season’s top scorer Josh Brownhill has departed and replacing his threat will be difficult. Lyle Foster started as the main striker at Spurs that was a struggle for Burnley, manageing just four shots on target. Armando Broja is waiting in the wings but needs to work on his physical condition before he can be considered for selection, understandable after his history of injury problems. A lot of pressure is placed on the Albania striker’s shoulders in the medium to long term but there is an immediate issue this weekend. If Scott Parker does not find goals, it could set the tone for what is to come. WU

Cherries moving beyond summer exodus
Bournemouth’s season is never going to hinge on results at the best teams in the division but an opening-day defeat at Anfield offered plenty of positives. A typically buccaneering performance by Andoni Iraola’s side suggested a summer of change has not been as damaging as perhaps feared. Adrien Truffert, the left-back signed from Rennes, was particularly impressive and they have since augmented their squad with addition of Amine Adli, who was part of Xabi Alonso’s double-winning Bayer Leverkusen side in 2023-24. Ben Gannon Doak – who wishes to reflect both of his parents’ names – is another exciting arrival before hosting Wolves. Last week Dango Ouattara became the latest player to exit, for Brentford, in a deal worth up to £42.5m. A buzz does not breed guarantees but Bournemouth appear to have taken the summer exodus in their stride. Ben Fisher

Merino set for emergency role
Amid all the excitement about Eberechi Eze’s impending arrival at Arsenal, spare a thought for Mikel Merino. The Spain midfielder’s prospects in his favoured position already looked bleak after the signing of compatriot Martín Zubimendi meant he started the season on the bench after spending the second half of the previous campaign filling in as a makeshift No 9. The knee injury suffered by Kai Havertz means Merino could find himself back in that position over the next few weeks given that he is the only other player in Mikel Arteta’s squad capable of replacing Viktor Gyökeres through the middle. Eze is expected to compete with Gabriel Martinelli on the left-hand side of Arsenal’s attack but can also play in midfield. The new man is unlikely to be available to face Leedsbut Merino could have an important role to play. Ed Aarons

New home, familiar Everton problems
It is the dawn of a new era for Everton as the £800m Hill Dickinson Stadium hosts its first competitive game and 52,769 fans adapt to plush modern surroundings. There will be pre-match events to mark the occasion, a special edition programme priced £10 and wide-eyed astonishment at the complete lack of obstructed views. It is a momentous day for the club and the city but Everton will be trying to tread a fine line between celebrating their new home while ensuring the focus remains on, and the fervour behind, David Moyes’s team. Monday’s performance at Leeds was chastening for those Evertonians who had approached the new campaign with unusual optimism. Perhaps not for the Everton manager who has spent all summer calling for more improvements to his squad. Everton were fortunate to lose their opening home game of last season 3-0 against Brighton, such was the second half dominance of Fabian Hürzeler’s side, and soon lost the positive momentum they had built up in the final weeks of the previous campaign. Everton require a fresh start all round. Andy Hunter

Glasner short on personnel for Palace
We are only a week into the new season but Oliver Glasner already has concerns about a lack of squad depth at Crystal Palace. The expected departure of Eberechi Eze means Palace must act quickly to find a replacement, with Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss and Tyler Dibling of Southampton among those considered. In the meantime, a knee injury to Daichi Kamada – who often played further forward under Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt – could rule him out of the grudge match with Nottingham Forest on Sunday, meaning that Palace may turn to Community Shield penalty shootout hero Justin Devenny. The 21-year-old Northern Irishman signed from Airdrieonians in 2023, just four Premier League starts last season has very big boots to fill. EA

Mount or Sesko is Amorim’s choice
Flashes of positivity for Manchester United during their defeat by Arsenal are all well and good but Ruben Amorim could do with improved results. United must also improve in both boxes. Will Amorim tweaks his attack on Sunday. Does Mason Mount continue as a false No 9 or is Benjamin Sesko ready to lead the line from the start? There was a feeling United were not quite as effective after Mount went off against Arsenal. He has endured a wretched few years but is a useful, influential team player when on form with the ability to create space for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Still, Sesko has not been signed to sit on the bench. The gargantuan Slovenian is a handful for anyone while a team who have struggled for goals under Amorim could do with a finisher in the starting XI. JS

Isak wrangle will stoke fires at St James’
Matches involving Newcastle and Liverpool often contain a bit of an edge but this rerun of last season’s Carabao Cup final will surely take things to a different level. Eddie Howe’s team won that showpiece yet one of their heroes of the hour, Alexander Isak, is at war with Newcastle as he endeavours to, currently rather forlornly, engineer a move to Anfield. With the Sweden striker training alone the only certainty is that Isak will not be at St James’ Park where geordie anger at Liverpool’s perceived tactics in unsettling Tyneside’s fallen idol should guarantee already febrile emotions run high. Howe is expected to field the former Everton winger, and boyhood Liverpool fan, Anthony Gordon out of position at centre-forward. Gordon, along with Isak and Fabian Schär, scored in last December’s fabulous 3-3 Premier League draw between these teams. Back then Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah scored twice in the course of a wonderful performance. The Egyptian’s duel with Howe’s likely left-back, Tino Livramento, could prove pivotal. Louise Taylor

Mateta gives Crystal Palace advantage over Fredrikstad in Conference playoff,Crystal Palace 1-0 Fredrikstad,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/crystal-palace-fredrikstad-conference-league-playoff-match-report,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 21:08:52",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"It might not be the Europa League. But even the absence of Eberechi Eze as he closes in on his £67.5m move to Arsenal could not spoil Crystal Palace’s first taste of European football as they sealed a victory in the first leg of their Conference League playoff.
After a summer of uncertainty over which competition they would play in, the last thing that Oliver Glasner would have wanted was to receive a call from Eze on the morning of the game informing the Palace manager that he was not feeling well enough to play. Yet having struggled to break down well-drilled Norwegian side Fredrikstad in the first half in the absence of their talismanic England forward, Jean-Philippe Mateta’s goal calmed Palace’s nerves, even if they could not find a second that could have proved crucial as Palace attempt to secure their place in the group stages of Uefa’s third-tier competition. Glasner, who led Eintracht Frankfurt to victory in the Europa League in 2022, will know that this tie is far from over given that they must play the second leg next week on an artificial surface. Nothing is ever certain when it comes to Palace.
Glasner could not hide his disappointment beforehand that Eze would not feature, admitting that it had disrupted his side’s preparations. “It is not what you want to do, to change the starting XI on matchday, especially in this situation – the first time in European football for Crystal Palace,” he said before kick-off.
Despite the lingering feeling of disappointment of not being able to take up their place in the Europa League, there was still a sense of anticipation on the streets of south London beforehand. The Conference League anthem was widely booed as the Palace ultras behind the goal immediately struck up their chant that takes aim at Uefa, former part-owner John Textor and the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis – all of whom have been blamed for their controversial demotion to this competition for breaking multi-club ownership regulations.
Strictly speaking, Palace have played in Europe before but it was in the long forgotten Intertoto Cup in 1998 when they qualified because they were the only English team to apply for entry. That adventure lasted only two matches in 4-0 aggregate defeat against Turkish side Samsunspor and having been eliminated in a playoff while in charge of Wolfsburg, Glasner was clearly taking no chances here. Justin Devenny – who scored the winning penalty in the Community Shield victory – struggled after being handed the unenviable task of replacing Eze, although the Croatia defender Borna Sosa impressed on his full debut.
Fredrikstad, who capped their first season back in Norway’s top flight since 2012 by winning their domestic cup competition, lined up with five at the back and came ready to defend. They could even have snatched an equaliser when substitute Henrik Skogvold dragged his shot wide in injury-time.
Without Eze to inspire them, it took Palace time to find their feet against a side that are more than half way through their league campaign and will have the weekend off before the second leg. Mateta finally forced goalkeeper Martin Børsheim into a save after 20 minutes but otherwise the vociferous group of travelling supporters had reason to feel encouraged. A speculative shot that flew way off target from Marc Guéhi – another Palace player whose future is uncertain – summed up the hosts’ frustration. The swaggering Adam Wharton looked like their most likely creative source from his deeper midfield role, although it was from a corner that Mateta was able to swivel and strike the post. That seemed to wake Palace up and Ismaïla Sarr’s header moments later was just about scrambled away to safety.
Glasner did not seem happy as he strode down the tunnel. His side emerged with renewed purpose for the second half and Devenny headed over a golden opportunity from Guéhi’s cross. But, to the home crowd’s relief, they finally found the breakthrough when Mateta cleverly redirected a wayward volley from Will Hughes. Sosa could have extended their lead but he fired just over after good work from Sarr, with Glasner turning to the out-of-favour Odsonne Édouard to replace Devenny as they went on the attack. Daniel Muñoz hit the post from Jefferson Lerma’s cross and Guéhi headed wide from a corner but Fredrikstad’s defence was able to hold firm.
The lack of alternatives from the bench – Romain Esse, the 20-year-old who cost around £12m from Millwall in January was surprisingly not called upon here – will only strengthen Glasner’s case for reinforcements before the transfer window closes, as he made his feelings clear after the game. But after the disruption of the last few days, Palace will still be strong favourites to finish the job next week.

More woe for Spurs as Dejan Kulusevski is likely to be out until turn of the year,Midfielder sidelined after undergoing knee surgery,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/more-woe-for-spurs-as-dejan-kulusevski-is-likely-to-be-out-until-turn-of-the-year,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:30:14",David Hytner,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Dejan Kulusevski is expected to be out until around the turn of the year, the Guardian understands. The Tottenham attacking midfielder underwent knee surgery in mid-May and, although the injury was serious, the extent of the lay-off he faces has until now been unclear.
Losing the Sweden international, who scored 10 goals and provided 11 assists in 50 appearances for Spurs last season, is another headache for Thomas Frank, who is digesting the club being gazumped by Arsenal for the £67.5m signature of Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze. The manager’s other key attacking midfielder, James Maddison, is a long-term casualty after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament against Newcastle in pre-season.
The pressure is on Spurs to respond to missing out on Eze with a statement signing after the failure earlier in the summer to sign Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White. They thought they had the midfielder after moving on a £60m buyout clause in his contract only for the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, to refuse to sanction the deal.
Spurs have shown an interest in the Manchester City winger Savinho, although City maintain they want to keep the Brazilian. Spurs play at City on Saturday lunchtime. Whether their opponents soften their stance after the game remains to be seen.
Spurs have made inquiries about Monaco’s Maghnes Akliouche. The France Under-21 international, who has burnished his reputation after two impressive seasons at Monaco, can play on the wing or through the middle. Frank is also open to signing Yoane Wissa from his former club Brentford and retains an interest in the Southampton winger Tyler Dibling, while Como’s Nico Paz is another option.
Spurs have been relatively quiet so far in the transfer window. In terms of new faces, they have added Mohammed Kudus, João Paulinha, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai.

Liverpool’s Frimpong out until after international break with hamstring injury,Full-back sustained injury during win over Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/jeremie-frimpong-out-until-after-international-break-hamstring-injury,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:35:44",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool will be without new signing Jeremie Frimpong until after the next international break as a result of a hamstring injury. Conor Bradley is in contention to replace Frimpong having recovered from a hamstring injury of his own.
Frimpong suffered the setback during the Premier League opener against Bournemouth, when he was replaced on the hour mark, and the head coach, Arne Slot, revealed the injury could have been worse but for the intervention of Liverpool’s medical team.
The £29.5m signing from Bayer Leverkusen is likely to be out for four weeks but, with the first international break of the season from 1-9 September, the only games he should miss for Liverpool are Monday’s visit to Newcastle and the home match against Arsenal next Sunday.
Slot said: “Conor trained for a few minutes with us today for the first time. The medical team were completely right about Jeremie and to tell me that I had to take him off because he is out until the end of the international break.
“I think I got criticised a bit for taking him off. It had nothing to do with how he played but we felt he had an issue with his hamstring and by we, I mean the medical staff. They were completely right. It was a good call to take him off, otherwise he maybe would have been out for longer. We expect to have him back after the international break.”
Bradley is not guaranteed to start at St James’ Park given he has been out for several weeks while Joe Gomez, another potential replacement for Frimpong, has just recovered from an achilles injury.
“At the moment we only have two injuries but unfortunately it is two in the same position,” Slot added. “The good thing is we have other players that can play there. Wataru [Endo] played there for a few minutes, Dominik Szoboszlai has already played there. There are other options we can explore. Joe Gomez is definitely one of them but for him to already play 20 minutes [against Bournemouth] that is already quite a lot.
“I wouldn’t say [Gomez] has had a setback but he wasn’t able to train three days in a row completely with the team, which is completely normal when you have been out for so long and all of a sudden the manager needs you for 20 minutes. He is training with the team, so let’s see where he is on Monday and if he can be involved with the team or even start. But there are other options.”

Battle with Arsenal for Eberechi Eze was a fight Spurs feared they wouldn’t win | David Hytner,Despite working on the transfer all summer Tottenham felt their north London rivals were always waiting to pounce for the Crystal Palace man,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/the-battle-with-arsenal-for-eberechi-eze-was-a-fight-spurs-knew-they-wouldnt-win,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 19:03:11",David Hytner,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","It was towards the end of June when it became clear that Tottenham were considering a move for Eberechi Eze, one to install him as the centrepiece of their new project under Thomas Frank. Or, at least, when it became public knowledge. And it was the prompt for two things to happen.
Firstly, it would be reported a few days later that Arsenal were also on the case. The club’s new sporting director, Andrea Berta, had put the feelers out for the Crystal Palace forward. Call it a declaration of interest, albeit Berta was having a lot of conversations about a lot of potential targets at the time. His idea was to have plenty of options on the boil before deciding which to prioritise.
Then, there was a subtle change to the mood music at Spurs, a kind of step back into a holding pattern. Agent talk, was the word inside the club. Eze was more likely to stay at Palace. It would be wrong to get too far ahead of anything on this one. But it was impossible to ignore the alternative reading: Spurs did not want to be drawn into a battle with their rivals over one of the most exciting talents on the market.
Spurs were fearful of that, and for good reason. They had to know that, given the choice, Eze would go for Arsenal over them. There were the emotional reasons. He had supported Arsenal as a kid and played in their academy until his release as a 13-year-old; the line about how he cried for a week afterwards is a well-known part of his story. Yet it would not only be about dreams and unfinished business. Eze would surely look at the Premier League table from last season. At which club would he stand the better chance of winning the title?
At this point it is worth introducing Mikel Arteta, who let it be known just how highly he rated Eze and how perfectly he would fit into his team. Eze’s head was turned. So Spurs entered territory in which the reward was tantalising, almost irresistible, but the risk was extreme. It was as if they were shadow boxing with Arsenal, their every move over Eze likely to come right back at them. Arsenal were a devil on their shoulder; watching, waiting.
Spurs would pivot to Morgan Gibbs-White in July only to run into the immovable object that is Evangelos Marinakis. No deal, the Nottingham Forest owner said. There would be a new one for Gibbs-White at Forest and, sadly for Spurs, egg on their face after they believed they would be able to exploit a £60m release clause in his old contract.
The Gibbs-White episode has been a climate-shaper in Spurs’s summer and then there was the moment when James Maddison ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in the pre-season game against Newcastle on 3 August; a shattering blow for him and Spurs.
Dejan Kulusevski, the club’s other key central attacking midfielder, had knee surgery in May and is out until around the turn of the year, so the need to act in the market was obvious and urgent. Why not move straight away for Eze; give him and Palace a decision to make by meeting the £68m release clause in his deal, which was in place until 15 August?
Spurs’s hesitation was to do with the fact they considered the number to be too high for a 27-year-old with 12 England caps and no experience of European football at club level. It is not the only detail in terms of optics that has hurt them as Arsenal prepare to pay pretty much that amount to take Eze to the Emirates, with Spurs themselves having ended up ready to do likewise.
There has been the idea that Spurs had a clear run at Eze because Arsenal, after spending around £200m on six other signings, would need to raise money via sales before they could make a bid. Well, they have sold nobody and still pushed the button. Unless Arsenal have a sale or two lined up, could it be that they have more financial headroom than they have let on?
It is easy to pick over the curiosities. Eze is represented by CAA Base, the influential firm of agents who have close links to Spurs. Should that have given Spurs an edge? It must be said that Base will always put the wishes of their players first. And why did it seemingly take Kai Havertz feeling a knee injury after Sunday’s win at Manchester United for Arsenal to move on Eze? There are similarities in the profile of both players but there is a fundamental difference: Havertz can play as a No 9, Eze cannot. With Gabriel Jesus a long-term injury casualty, the loss of Havertz ought to have led Arsenal to look for a No 9 to provide support for the new signing, Viktor Gyökeres. Not take Eze.
The reality is that Spurs were never going to win this fight. We will never know what would have happened if they had offered to pay Eze’s release clause. But it feels fair to assume that it would have led Arsenal into following suit. Spurs eventually reached an agreement with Palace on Wednesday and they believed they had one with Eze, too.
If Arsenal were not an option, Eze would have joined Spurs. At this stage of his career, after giving everything for Palace across five seasons, he is ready for a change; the chance to play in the Champions League. But Arsenal were an option; they never went away. It took them a matter of hours to slide in for the steal. The bad news for Spurs is that the very thing they feared has come to pass. The memes are out, an Eze mural has appeared in the tunnel outside the Emirates and the time is tighter to provide Frank with a new No 10.
Have Spurs built on the momentum of their Europa League triumph from last season? They have added João Paulinha and Mohammed Kudus for the starting XI, while it was a tonic to tie the new captain, Cristian Romero, to a long-term contract. But when their supporters look around, they see that Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal have spent £200m or significantly upwards on signings. Manchester City, meanwhile, have invested £150m. The mood at Tottenham is back to being edgy. Arsenal have made a statement of intent.

Graham Potter has ‘no doubt about ability’ as West Ham push for signings,West Ham host Chelsea on Friday after Sunderland loss,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/graham-potter-west-ham-chelsea-transfer-window,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 21:30:17",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"Graham Potter has not been left with any doubt about his managerial ability after making a poor start to the season but he has warned West Ham will struggle to improve if they do not learn from previous mistakes in the transfer market.
Potter, who is looking for a response from his players in Friday evening’s home game against Chelsea, inherited an ageing squad after his appointment as manager in January. He is urgently looking for reinforcements after losing 3-0 to Sunderland last Saturday but West Ham have not landed many of their top targets and found a tight budget limited by the difficulty of selling players who are on lucrative long-term deals.
There is hope that the club, who are paying the price for ill-advised spending sprees in recent summer windows, will be able to sign two midfielders after agreeing to send Edson Álvarez on loan to Fenerbahce. But Potter, who works closely with his recruitment chief, Kyle Macaulay, stressed that he will avoid quick fixes after being asked if he is worried about a lack of depth in several key areas.
“We need a few silver bullets, not just one,” the former Chelsea manager said. “We analyse where we think the improvements can be and then we have to try to work within the financial position of the club to make the right decision to bring the right player and the right person here. If I look historically, West Ham have spent money, have signed players. Signing players is easy. It doesn’t mean that they’re going to be the right ones.
“It doesn’t mean to say that the team’s going to improve. It doesn’t mean to say that in six months’ time you’re stuck with a player that’s on too much money, that’s too old and you can’t sell them. It would be nice to have £200m to spend but that’s not the case. I have to work with what I have responsibly.”
Potter has won only five league games since replacing Julen Lopetegui. “I have no doubt whatsoever about my ability,” he said. “I have no doubt about the players and I have no doubt about the team that we’ll improve. I understand people will be critical. That’s the world we’re in. No point complaining about it. I couldn’t care less what you guys think or what people say from outside.”
Potter suggested that West Ham became too emotional after going behind against Sunderland. He added that he trusts the squad’s leadership group of Nayef Aguerd, Jarrod Bowen, Niclas Füllkrug, Maximilian Kilman, Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse to lift the mood in the dressing room.
Meanwhile, Enzo Maresca has said Wesley Fofana is happy at Chelsea despite the defender removing pictures of himself playing for the club from his Instagram account.
The 24-year-old, who was an unused substitute during Sunday’s 0-0 draw at home to Crystal Palace, previously did the same in 2022 as he sought a move away from Leicester, just before sealing a £70m switch to Stamford Bridge.
Fofana, who missed a large part of last season after injuring his hamstring in December, is expected to play some part against West Ham. “I spoke with Wes every day, he’s very happy, first of all because he’s back from injury, he’s joining all the sessions with us,” said Maresca. “He was on the bench just to be with us but from [Friday] he can get some minutes.
“We are happy, he is happy. About Instagram, I don’t have any idea because I don’t use social networks.”

"‘Lads, it’s Tottenham’: missing out on Eze just the latest banana skin | Rob Davies",Supporting Spurs means imagining the most embarrassing thing that could befall a club and knowing it’s going to happen,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/lads-its-tottenham-missing-out-on-eze-just-the-latest-slip-on-a-banana-skin,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:01:07",Rob Davies,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Earlier this month, my Spurs WhatsApp group was debating whether, if you could only have one, you’d sign Eberechi Eze or Savinho. Ever the ray of sunshine, I confessed that my “gut feeling” was that we wouldn’t get either. A few days later, I doubled down.
Despite reports suggesting Eze was practically on the 149 bus heading for N17, I had the nagging sense that Arsenal might gazump us at the last minute. The reason for such a grim forecast was that I’d seen this tragi-comic movie before. Spurs have “nearly” signed everyone from Jean-Pierre Papin to Eden Hazard to Rivaldo, who famously wrote to Glenn Hoddle outlining why he’d inexplicably chosen San Siro over White Hart Lane.
All clubs miss out on transfers from time to time. My pessimism sprang from somewhere else, somewhere darker and more psychologically deep-rooted.
Supporting Tottenham Hotspur so often means imagining the most ludicrous, embarrassing thing that could possibly befall the club and then knowing, with crystal clarity, that it’s going to happen. Fans of other clubs – Wimbledon, Bury or Morecambe – have had it much worse, but no other club so expertly combines the slapstick and the high-profile. At Tottenham we wait until everyone is watching, then we slip on the banana skin.
Think missing out on the Champions League because of a dodgy lasagne, or blowing a 2-0 lead in a European tie to a team whose manager is in prison. Think the famous “Lads, it’s Tottenham” game, which warped my expectations of football – and indeed life – as an 18-year-old in the stands in growing horror. Far from breaking the curse, the Europa League triumph seems merely to have angered the footballing gods, who swiftly set about restoring the karmic balance via the Morgan Gibbs-White debacle, the heartbreaking injury to James Maddison, and now this.
Missing out on Eze is a worthy addition to the pantheon of pratfalls, although not necessarily because of the player himself. A fine footballer he may be, but Eze isn’t necessarily the right fit for the gap left by Maddison’s injury. Right now, Spurs badly lack passing ability and there are better candidates who are younger, cheaper and have a higher ceiling than Eze. No, there are two reasons this one will stick in the collective psyche of Spurs fans. The first, of course, is that we’ve been done over by that lot up the road, who appear to have been stealthily plotting for weeks, even as details of our haggling over add-ons and chairman-to-chairman talks played out in public.
Arsenal fans won’t tire of reminding us about this all season; in the office, the pub and in the ground. More than that, though, this episode encapsulates the reign of Daniel Levy in microcosm. While rivals act decisively, we dither in the hope of a better deal, then miss out entirely. We spend but not quite enough, unwisely, or at the wrong time. We are all mouth – Levy says he wants to win the Premier League and Champions League – and no trousers. When it comes to transfers, the failure of Levy-era Tottenham to match his supposed ambition does not even have in it, to paraphrase the great Bill Nicholson, an echo of glory. Rather it is an echo of incompetence.
Nobody can argue with what Levy has achieved, delivering state-of-the-art facilities, a world-leading stadium and a regular place – albeit a fragile one – at football’s top table. For all the vitriol that is aimed at Levy, many of us are grateful for what he has done. But Levy is like a man who spends thousands of pounds tricking out a car that he never takes out of the garage because of the price of petrol. What was the point if you’re not going to test what it can do?
There remain many reasons to be optimistic about this season. Tottenham have a tactically astute new manager, taking charge of a squad that is both young and underrated after last year’s freakshow. The scouting set-up and club administration have been professionalised, putting Tottenham on a good footing for the future.
Yet, as long as the clownish blunders continue, the calls will grow louder for Levy to step aside, to find a new steward for Spurs, one who refuses to allow the club and its fans to be the butt of every joke. The game, after all, is supposed to be about glory.

Crystal Palace will back Oliver Glasner in market after Eze departs for Arsenal,‘We have to find other players to bring in to support team’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/crystal-palace-will-back-oliver-glasner-in-market-after-eze-departs-for-arsenal,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 22:32:25",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"The Crystal Palace chairman, Steve Parish, has confirmed that Eberechi Eze is to complete his move to Arsenal but has been urged to find replacements by his clearly frustrated manager, Oliver Glasner.
Palace will head to Norway for the second leg of their Conference League playoff against Fredrikstad on an artificial surface with a 1-0 lead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta’s header. But with Eze having pulled out on the morning of the game citing illness after Arsenal agreed a fee worth up to £67.5m for the England forward on Wednesday evening, they struggled to break their opponents down and Parish acknowledged that it is imperative Palace are decisive in the transfer market.
“He’s been fantastic for the club,” he said of Eze on Channel 5. “We all love him for what he’s done and what he’s achieved and we’re pleased that he’s going to go on and fulfil the other ambitions that he’s got. But the king is no longer the king, right? We have to move past it and we have to find other players to bring in that could support the rest of the team and Oliver.” Parish also admitted that Marc Guéhi could still epart Palace with Liverpool interested in signing the Palace captain, who has entered the final year of his contract.
“If Marc wants to sign a contract, then he can stay. If he doesn’t want to sign a contract, then we have to look at it,” he said. “It’s a difficult situation. Every club like us, and particularly if you’re in Europe, the financial rules are a lot tighter than the Premier League. They’re a lot tighter. Everybody has to sell players to, you know, comply with the rules. So that’s a situation we’ll have to look at in the next 11 days.”
But Glasner was only half-joking when he suggested that Guéhi’s departure before next week’s second leg would force the former defender into considering playing himself.
“I just know if Marc leaves, and is not available for Fredrikstad, we would have big problems,” he said. “It’s pretty clear. We can’t register anyone. So from my side, he has to stay. You see, we played with Jefferson Lerma in the back today. He’s a midfield player. We have no centre-backs available at the moment, and if Marc leaves, OK, maybe I will ry my boots, because I was a centre-back and this could be a good option. I will think about it.”
Palace have spent the least amount of any club in Europe’s top five leagues and have earmarked Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss as a potential replacement for Eze.
Asked whether he felt disheartened by the situation after leading Palace to the FA Cup glory in May, Glasner added: “I think it’s better I don’t talk too much about it. Because, you know, I start to get … And it’s better than not always saying what you are feeling and what you’re thinking. We have to act. We need this. And this is Crystal Palace’s future. The profile is defined for months. It is not surprising for everyone that Ebs left. We missed the chance to replace him early enough. That’s completely our fault and nobody else’s.”

‘An amazing club to play for’: Harry Maguire keen to extend time at Manchester United,Centre-back’s contract ends next summer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/harry-maguire-extend-time-manchester-united,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:01:02",Jamie Jackson,['Manchester United'],"Harry Maguire has hinted at a desire to sign a new contract at Manchester United when his current deal expires next summer, though discussions regarding the defender’s future are yet to occur. United triggered a one-year extension in his terms in January.
“I’m sure over the next few months we’ll have a conversation about where we want to go and if they want to extend,” the 32-year-old said. “I have something in my mind about what I want to do. I don’t want to put it out there [publicly], but it’s an amazing club to play for and you’d be silly if you wanted to jump out of it as soon as you could. I think there were a couple of clubs who enquired or spoke with them [the club] and I think they got a quick response.”
Despite United opening the new season with a 1-0 loss to Arsenal, Maguire believes they are in a better position than when he joined them from Leicester for £80m in August 2019. “We’re in a good place, positive as a club and I feel like the hierarchy has come in and Jason [Wilcox, director of football] and the manager – they’re taking it in the right direction,” he said. “Since I started six years ago to where it is now, it’s in a completely different place in terms of the structure behind the management staff.”
Maguire, who was speaking at the Manchester United Foundation Camp in Stretford, did not start in Sunday’s defeat at Old Trafford. Matthijs de Ligt was preferredas the middle centre-back in Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation, although he did come on in the 80th minute for Luke Shaw.
“Me and Matthijs have been playing that central role, but also we can play either side in the back three,” Maguire said. “I’ve proven that. I’ve done that for England and Mattias has done that numerous times for the Netherlands as well. There’s competition for places all over the pitch and that’s healthy in the squad.
“I feel in a good place. It’s been a couple of years now where I feel like I’ve played really well for this club again.”
Meanwhile, United have announced the appointment of Stephen Torpey as the club’s new academy director. Torpey joins from Brentford, where he led the rebuilding of the club’s youth structure.

Transfer latest: Edson Álvarez loan gives West Ham chance to recruit,Bournemouth going back to Chelsea for signings,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/transfer-latest-edson-alvarez-west-ham-bournemouth,"Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:00:50",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"West Ham will step up their hunt for midfield reinforcements after reaching an agreement to loan Edson Álvarez to Fenerbahce. The departure of the Mexico international gives the club extra funds to bring in new players.
West Ham want Álvarez’s wages of £115,000 a week off the books and have been waiting for him to agree to a season-long loan to Fenerbahce, who have included an option to buy in the deal. Álvarez has fallen from favour under Graham Potter, who is looking to add energy and creativity to his midfield. West Ham want two midfielders – one to sit deep and control play, another to operate in an advanced role – and have identified a number of targets.
West Ham, who opened their campaign with a 3-0 loss to Sunderland, lodged unsuccessful bids for Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes, Barcelona’s Marc Casadó and Chelsea’s Andrey Santos this week. Their improved offer of £30m plus £2m add-ons for Fernandes fell well below Southampton’s valuation of the 21-year-old. Southampton are likely to strengthen their financial position and boost their chances of keeping the Portuguese midfielder by selling the England under-21 winger Tyler Dibling to Everton.
Potter views Fernandes as his ideal No 8, but West Ham are not willing to meet Southampton’s asking price of £50m and will consider other options. The club are tracking Werder Bremen’s Romano Schmid and are interested in the Lens midfielder Andy Diouf.
West Ham are scouting extensively in France and like the 21-year-old Rennes midfielder Djaoui Cissé, who is reportedly a target for Inter. They are also looking at the Eredivisie and have added Ajax’s Kenneth Taylor to a list that already contains Feyernoord’s Quinten Timber. Another player of interest is Torino’s Ivan Ilic.
A possible affordable option to play further forward is Getafe’s Christantus Uche. The 22-year-old Nigerian can play as an attacking midfielder and up front. Uche scored and made a goal in Getafe’s win over Celta Vigo last Sunday.
West Ham remain open to offers for Guido Rodríguez and Andy Irving. They have signed four players this summer and have not been working with a big budget. Concerns over meeting the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations forced them to wait for Mohammed Kudus to join Tottenham for £55m before making signings.
Meanwhile, Bournemouth are exploring a move for the Chelsea defender Axel Disasi, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. Disasi, a £38.7m arrival from Monaco on a six-year contract in 2023, had an indifferent spell at Villa, making 10 appearances in all competitions. 
  Bournemouth want to strengthen at centre-back after the sales of Illia Zabarnyi and Dean Huijsen. They have added Bafodé Diakité from Lille but are searching for further defensive reinforcements. They previously expressed interest in the Chelsea teenager Josh Acheampong, who started against Crystal Palace last Sunday. Disasi was left out of Chelsea’s Club World Cup squad and did not feature against Palace.
  Bournemouth have done business with Chelsea this summer, with the Serbia goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic joining in a £25m deal. They have also signed Amine Adli, Ben Doak and Adrien Truffert this window. Luis Sinisterra, signed last year from Leeds, is poised to join Cruzeiro on loan.
Leeds have signed Switzerland forward Noah Okafor from Milan for a reported fee which could rise to £18m. Okafor, who spent the later part of last season on loan at Napoli, is Leeds’s ninth summer signing after promotion to the Premier League.
The club said: “Leeds United are delighted to announce the signing of Noah Okafor on a four-year contract, subject to a work permit and international clearance. The 25-year-old arrives at Elland Road on a permanent deal from Italian giants AC Milan and can operate across the forward areas on either wing, or as a central striker when required to do so.”
Okafor, who began his professional career at Basel, scored 34 goals and made 23 assists in 110 appearances for Salzburg before joining Milan in a £13.4m deal in July 2023. He scored seven goals and made five assists in two seasons at the Serie A club, which included his four-month loan spell at Napoli.
Nottingham Forest have announced the signing of Douglas Luiz on loan from Juventus. The 27-year-old Brazilian midfielder, who played for Aston Villa for five seasons from 2019, joins on a season-long loan with a conditional obligation to buy next summer.
Forest’s chief football officer, Ross Wilson, told the club’s website: “It’s been a very busy but successful period for us in the window in the past few weeks, and Douglas is another addition to the squad that will bring significant quality to the group. He’s played at the highest level for a long time, understands the demands of the Premier League, and has experience playing in elite European competition.”

"Football Daily | Wembley wins, Uefa blows and Eze: the bittersweet times of Crystal Palace",Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now?

These are bittersweet days at Selhurst Park. Win a first major trophy? Yay! Get demoted from Bigger Vase to Tin Pot? Eeeek. Away day to Lausanne for an appeal to overturn the decision? Believe. Beat the league champions at Wembley? Life is beautiful and the sunshine will never leave us. Lose the appeal the very next day? Life is a cruel, unrelenting beast and we reside on a dying planet marching towards extinction. Now comes the news of Eberechi Eze’s departure to Arsenal, brutal even if an exit was expected, another example of the big boys nabbing from the Premier League’s middle class.
Nonetheless, their Tin Pot playoff first leg brings a fresh chapter as Palace launch into their first proper European campaign. Alas, we can’t really pay too much attention to their participation in the 1998 Intertoto Cup – gone but never forgotten – taking place after they’d been relegated from the Premier League and resulting in a 4-0 defeat across two legs by Turkish side Samsunspor. A more successful run surely awaits this time. The example of Chelsea winning Tin Pot is a bit pointless, their presence undermining the tournament’s appeal, but West Ham’s 2023 triumph is the template to follow, a club not lavished with silverware relishing their night of history.
Oliver Glasner knows how to navigate the continent, having tasted Bigger Vase glory at Eintracht Frankfurt. He’s also moved past the multiple stages of grief after Palace’s drop to Europe’s third tier. “This is the last time I will respond to this question. We – the club, the fans, the players – deserve to play [Bigger Vase] because we are the FA Cup champions … but it was decided that we would get demoted,” harrumphed the Palace manager. “It’s still the first time European football is played at Selhurst*. This is the reward for winning the FA Cup and it’s European football, and we will enjoy it together with our fans.”
Fredrikstad, cup winners in Norway, are Palace’s opponents in this playoff tie. They’re presumably not in London to take part in a testimonial for Eze. But this will be a night for farewells should the 27-year-old still feature, a chance to witness him close out a memorable five-year spell that peaked with an immortal moment three months ago in the FA Cup final. For Palace, interrail pass to go with the bursting rucksack, it could well be the start of an exciting adventure.

"It’s taken 14 years and £67.5m, but Eberechi Eze is going back to Arsenal | Ed Aarons",Crystal Palace forward was released by club aged 13 and rejected by others before his breakthrough at QPR,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/14-years-67m-eberechi-eze-back-to-arsenal,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 11:45:04",Ed Aarons,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","They say good things come to those who wait. But for Eberechi Eze, it has taken 14 years for his dream to come true. The England forward made a dramatic entrance during Crystal Palace’s open training session on Wednesday before their Conference League playoff when he was last to emerge from the changing room with frenzied anticipation that his expected move to Tottenham was close to being agreed.
Even if he had been aware of Arsenal’s intention to step up their longstanding interest in him, Eze was certainly giving nothing away when he signed autographs and spoke to supporters on his way out of Palace’s training ground in Beckenham.
It was later on Wednesday afternoon that the Palace chair, Steve Parish, received a call from Arsenal’s executive vice-chair, Tim Lewis, indicating they were finally ready to act. The full severity of the knee injury suffered by Kai Havertz during his substitute appearance against Manchester United on Sunday is unknown, although the German forward is expected to be sidelined for the immediate future. With Arsenal facing four of last season’s top seven in successive Premier League matches after they entertain Leeds on Saturday, Mikel Arteta felt he was short of numbers in attack.
It is understood Parish had reluctantly agreed a fee with Spurs that in effect matched Eze’s expired release clause of £67.5m, albeit with them paying less than the £60m they had asked for up front and with more bonuses included. Arsenal were well aware Palace wanted immediate funds for a replacement and were ready with an offer that satisfied both sides.
Their trump card, however, was Eze. He has made no secret of his continued affiliations to the club that released him from their academy at the age of 13, even if the scars of rejection took a long time to heal. “It’s one of the hardest battles I’ve had,” he told the BBC before the FA Cup final in May. “Because of what Arsenal meant to me at the time, I had tears rolling down my face.”
He was also rejected by Fulham, Reading and Millwall before finally convincing Queens Park Rangers to give him a chance in 2016 as he was preparing to enrol in a local college and start working part-time at Tesco.
Their faith was rewarded by Eze’s breakthrough into the first team under the watchful eye of Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand, the former Tottenham striker who was QPR’s director of football when Palace paid £19.5m to sign him in August 2020 and inserted a 15% sell-on clause on any profit. That will ensure QPR receive around £6m from the move to Arsenal.
“Sometimes, as a player, you can think ‘has my chance gone?’ But he’s shown great strength of character and his ability has shone through,” said Ferdinand when Eze was called up by England for Euro 2024. “A lot of the best players have been rejected somewhere and it just pushes you on to achieve more.”
It took Eze three months to score his first goal for Palace, a brilliant free-kick against Leeds at an empty Selhurst Park – because of Covid restrictions – in November 2020, before he missed most of the next season with an achilles injury that also scuppered his hopes of a first England call-up.
But he has flourished since returning, scoring 29 times in the Premier League over the past three seasons and underlining his status as a Palace legend with the winning goal against Manchester City at Wembley when the club lifted their first major trophy. It seems fitting Eze chose a replica of the shirt Ian Wright and co wore in the 1990 FA Cup final for the parade a few days later, which had been donated by a fan. Wright, who joined Arsenal from Palace in September 1991 for £2.5m, was 27 at the time and proved he was more than capable of making the step up. Eze, born and raised in Greenwich – just up the road from Arsenal’s original home in Woolwich – will follow Kenny Sansom, Paul Davis and David Rocastle as south Londoners who crossed the river.
Eze will always have a special place in the hearts of Palace fans who will not begrudge him this deserved opportunity. As those who have followed the club for generations will testify after waving goodbye to Wright, Andy Johnson and Michael Olise over the years, it is best not to get too attached to your heroes.
