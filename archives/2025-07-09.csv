Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas provides the latest...",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13394079/arsenal-transfer-news-noni-madueke-rodrygo-eberechi-eze-viktor-gyokeres-latest,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:16:00",,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal are aiming to sign attacking reinforcements with Noni Madueke, Eberechi Eze, Rodrygo and Viktor Gyokeres all transfer targets. Sky Sports News' Lyall Thomas provides the latest...
Arsenal have been looking for a left-winger who can also play on the right and they believe Noni Madueke fits that profile.
There are understandable concerns among fans given Madueke's preferred side is the right which, of course, is where Bukayo Saka plays.
Madueke only played seven times on the left for Chelsea last season, compared to 33 games on the right, although Enzo Maresca used him on that side in four of their last five Premier League games.
Real Madrid forward Rodrygo is the other top target Arsenal have for that position. It appears unlikely they are going to sign both players, but it is unclear at this stage which deal the club are prioritising.
Rodrygo would certainly be the more exciting signing given his profile and pedigree, being a two-time Champions League winner.
Reports in Spain indicate he is valued at around £69m (€80m) which is likely to be a lot more than Chelsea demand for Madueke.
Rodrygo's future at Real Madrid is up in the air under new boss Xabi Alonso, who has given him a limited role at the Club World Cup. The Brazil forward has not started a match since their opener against Al Hilal.
The 24-year-old has become known for being a right-winger at Real Madrid, but his preferred position is on the left, which would suit Arsenal's needs.
Sky Sports News has been told Arsenal's pursuit of Eberechi Eze, if they decide to formalise their interest, is independent of their other attacking targets. That is an exciting prospect for Arsenal fans.
Thus far, there has been no contact with Crystal Palace for Eze, who has a release clause of £60m that could rise with add-ons.
Arsenal view Eze as a No 10 who has a different profile to their captain Martin Odegaard. The England playmaker is seen as a direct option who can deliver goals from that position whereas Odegaard is a player who excels at creating for others.
Eze scored 14 goals compared to Odegaard's six last season across all competitions.
Spurs have also expressed an interest in Eze this summer, but as it stands their focus is on other targets as they pursue a deal for Mohammed Kudus at West Ham.
The release clause ensures there will be no bidding war for Eze. The key aspect of this deal will be convincing the player of the project. Sky Sports News understands Eze is open to joining Arsenal.
The 27-year-old has ambitions of playing in the Champions League which likely narrows Arsenal's potential competition to just four other teams. There is no certainty, however, that Eze will leave Crystal Palace.
The incentive of a season in Europe with Palace, dependent on UEFA's judgment, is a strong argument the south London club can make to try and convince their star man to stay for another season.
With two years left on his deal, though, this might be the last summer Palace can insist interested clubs pay his release clause in full.
If Arsenal were to sign Gyokeres, Eze and one of Madueke or Rodrygo then there would certainly be a lot of competition for places at the Emirates and a big outlay on arrivals.
The need for strength in depth was made clear to Mikel Arteta and Arsenal last season when injuries derailed their season, but this number of new signings would likely leave one of Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli with a very diminished role.
Oleksandr Zinchenko faces an uncertain future and according to Sky in Italy, is of interest to AC Milan as a replacement for Theo Hernandez.
It is one to keep an eye on, though it will likely be dependent on how Arsenal get on with the rest of their business. There has already been noise about their potential exits, but it is nothing concrete at this stage.
Arsenal have plenty of room for manoeuvre in terms of the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) this summer but if they get all of those signings over the line there may well be a desire to make some sales to balance the books a bit.
As with all clubs, Arsenal are conscious of staying in line with the financial rules.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Spanish police: Jota believed to be driver of car involved in fatal accident,"Spanish police say ""all the evidence so far indicates"" Diogo Jota was the driver of the car involved in the accident that killed the Liverpool forward and his brother, Andre Silva.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13394038/diogo-jota-spanish-police-believe-liverpool-forward-was-driver-of-car-in-fatal-accident-which-killed-him-and-his-brother,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 13:10:00",,['Liverpool'],"Spanish police say ""all the evidence so far indicates"" Diogo Jota was the driver of the car involved in the accident that killed the Liverpool forward and his brother, Andre Silva.
Police also believe ""the vehicle significantly exceeded the speed limit for the highway"" at the time of the accident.
The accident happened at 12.30am local time on Thursday (11.30pm Wednesday BST) on the A-52 motorway in the municipality of Cernadilla, Zamora.
It is understood Jota was travelling from Portugal to Santander in northern Spain, where he was due to take the ferry back to England.
A statement published by the Civil Guard in Zamora on Tuesday read: ""The expert report is being prepared and finalised.
""Among other things, the marks left by one of the vehicle's wheels are being examined.
""All the evidence so far indicates that the driver of the crashed vehicle was Diogo Jota.
""The expert report is not yet complete, but as it is subject to judicial review, it will be submitted to the Puebla de Sanabria court.""
Last Thursday, the Civil Guard said in a statement to Sky Sports News: ""A vehicle left the road and everything indicates a tyre burst while overtaking.
""As a result of the accident, the car caught fire and both people were killed.""
The funeral for Jota and his brother, Silva, was held in the town of Gondomar, near Porto, on Saturday.
On Tuesday, Liverpool manager Arnie Slot, defender Andy Robertson and FSG CEO Michael Edwards visited Anfield and laid flowers in tribute to Jota.

19 forwards and £600m later... is Joao Pedro the frontman Chelsea need?,"Chelsea's search for a centre-forward has been far, wide and expensive - but has Joao Pedro already shown he could be the answer?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cev0njr4ykpo,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 22:34:23",Matthew Howarth,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea aren't exactly short of riches in the forward department, but Joao Pedro may have just given himself a head start over his new attacking colleagues before Sunday's Club World Cup final.
The Brazilian, who joined Chelsea from Brighton last week, is one of 19 forwards to  have signed for the Blues under their American owners, who have now spent £600m on attacking players since assuming control of the club in 2022.
After making his debut in the Club World Cup quarter-final win over Palmeiras on Saturday, the frontman was handed his first start in the last-four tie against Fluminense – his boyhood side – and announced his arrival with two stunning strikes either side of half-time.
With 18 minutes gone, the Brazilian collected a half-cleared cross on the corner of the penalty area, took one touch to steady himself and arrowed a stunning drive past 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio and into the far corner to open the scoring.
His second was just as aesthetically pleasing as he ran onto Enzo Fernandez's throughball from near the halfway line, darted into the box and slammed a right-footed shot into the net via the crossbar 11 minutes into the second half.
With Chelsea set to receive £21.9m for reaching the final – where they will play either Real Madrid or Paris St-Germain – Joao Pedro's goalscoring exploits on Tuesday mean he has already repaid over a third of his transfer fee.
""It was a dream,"" he told DAZN afterwards. ""I don't think it could have gone any better.
""I'm happy to have scored my first goals. [The Club World Cup] would be my first title as well. I only came here a week ago, and now I'm going to play the final.""
Have Chelsea finally found the answer to their centre-forward woes?
'A great all-round performance'
Enzo Maresca's side have wasted little time in bolstering their attacking options this summer, bringing in Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund, Ipswich Town's Liam Delap and Brazilian teenager Estevao Willian from Palmeiras – as well as Joao Pedro.
The former Brighton striker, who scored 30 goals in 70 games for the Seagulls after joining from Watford in 2023, has been signed to provide competition for the number nine and 10 positions.
And he staked his claim for a regular place in Maresca's team with a superb full debut at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium.
The Brazilian found the net with two of his three attempts – and with both his efforts on target. Only Christopher Nkunku registered as many shots, while no other Blues player had as many shots on target.
The forward also gave the Blues an attacking focal point, competing in nine duels and four aerial duels before being replaced by Nicolas Jackson on the hour mark.
Only Nkunku and Moises Caicedo – both of whom were on the pitch a lot longer – registered more duels overall, with only Marc Cucurella and Trevoh Chalobah taking part in as many aerial tussles.
""It's not just the goals,"" said ex-Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale on DAZN. ""It's the link-up play, it's the passing, it's the vision. It was a great all-round performance.
""This is the next step up in his career. He's on the right trajectory. We can see the ability he's got and hopefully he can keep kicking on.""
England forward Callum Wilson added: ""He's already a player with confidence but he will have wanted to hit the ground running straight away and that's exactly what he has done.
""What a signing he could turn out to be.""
'I have my way' - Joao Pedro involved all over the pitch
Joao Pedro registered 26 touches of the ball against Fluminense. Of all Chelsea forwards to have started at the Club World Cup, only Jackson has managed as many touches in a match.
Not all of the Brazilian's touches took place inside the opposition half, however – far from it.
He was involved all over the pitch in Tuesday's semi-final, with seven of his touches coming inside his own half.
""The good thing about Joao is that we knew already how good he was,"" said Maresca after the game, also revealing he spoke to ex-Brighton manager Roberto de Zerbi prior to signing him.
""Today he played deep but we know he is able to drop deep and link up the play. That's why we decided to bring him in.""
By contrast, Delap only touched the ball twice inside his own half after starting Chelsea's final group game against Tunis, while only four of Jackson's touches against Los Angeles FC took place in the Blues' half of the pitch.
Joao Pedro also made more of an impact in wide areas, regularly popping up on both flanks in an effort to influence Chelsea's build-up play.
The majority of Delap and Jackson's touches, meanwhile, were in central areas in the final third of the pitch.
""Every team has a different style to play: Delap has a style, Jackson another and I have my way,"" Joao Pedro said before Tuesday's game.
""I think whoever brings more good things to the team is going to play.""
On this evidence, Joao Pedro has more than an outside chance of beating both Delap and Jackson to a starting berth in Sunday's showpiece.

Liverpool players return to training after Jota death,Liverpool players have started to return to the club for pre-season training following the death of team-mate Diogo Jota.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy8g42gd164o,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 12:02:49",Mandeep Sanghera,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool players have started to return to the club for pre-season training following the death of team-mate Diogo Jota.
The first set of players were scheduled to come back from their summer break last Friday but that was postponed after Jota, 28, and his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva died in a car accident.
Jota was on his way back to Liverpool for pre-season and, as doctors had advised him against flying because he had undergone minor surgery, he was making the trip by car and ferry.
A large contingent of players and staff from the Anfield club paid their respects to the forward and his brother at a public wake in their native Portugal on Friday.
The funeral took place on Saturday in their hometown of Gondomar, with Reds captain Virgil van Dijk and Scotland defender Andy Robertson carrying floral tributes in honour of Jota and Andre Silva.
Manager Arne Slot was also part of Liverpool's delegation and his side are due to play their first pre-season match against Preston North End at Deepdale on Sunday, 13 July.
Tributes continue for Jota and Andre Silva
Liverpool Women players Grace Fisk and Gemma Bonner laid a floral tribute, external for Jota and Andre Silva on behalf of their team outside Anfield on Tuesday.
It added to the wealth of tributes outside the stadium, while some have also been placed at the club's training ground.
Jota joined Liverpool from Wolves in 2020 and people have also been paying their respects at the Midlands club's Molineux stadium.
There have also been tributes to Jota outside the football academy in Gondomar where he played and which is named after him.

João Pedro leaves it to Chelsea fans to celebrate after double against old side | Sid Lowe,The £60m Brazilian scored both goals but showed no emotion as Fluminense were his first club in his homeland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/08/joao-pedro-leaves-it-to-chelsea-fans-to-celebrate-after-double-against-old-side,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 22:29:42",Sid Lowe,['Chelsea'],"This time last week, João Pedro was on a Brazilian beach; now he’s in the Club World Cup final, handed a standing ovation by old fans and new. The 23-year-old forward had been on holiday in Rio de Janeiro when they called to say his £60m transfer to Chelsea had been completed and could he come straight here.
Two days and a single training session later, he made his debut in Philadelphia, more than 4,000 miles north of home, a promising glimpse of a future. Four days after that, he was given his first start in New Jersey. It took 18 minutes to get a glorious goal. By the time he headed off, an hour in, he had another.
He didn’t celebrate either, but there will be another chance soon. He’ll be back here on Sunday, Chelsea delivered to the final day. He, perhaps more than any of them, knows what this means. “I can’t stop doing my job,” he had said the day before this semi-final against Fluminense; no one expected him to start doing it quite so quickly, and definitely not quite so well.
Yes, he had prepared – “I was in Brazil with friends but I have a personal trainer; imagine if I didn’t train and Chelsea called me to come,” he said – but still. This was something else, certainly compared to the Chelsea strikers who have gone before.
He might not even have had the chance to play at all but for the suspension of Liam Delap – but by the time he walked his work was done, a case made to start on his own merits. As he departed, João Pedro applauded the Chelsea fans to his left. Then he applauded the Fluminense fans to his right. Please allow me to introduce myself. And: sorry about that. Both applauded back, from Rio de Janeiro to the MetLife and a whole new life, this was his moment.
He had scored two, both of them brilliant strikes, and had been as good as his word. The first bent into the top corner; the second battered off the bar and into the net. No, he had not promised to score, still less like that, but he had promised not to celebrate if he did. And so after each, up went the hands, in apology.
The team he had just defeated was his boyhood club. He had joined Fluminense at 10, travelling to live in Rio with his mother. “I went there and I didn’t have nothing. They gave me everything and they showed me to the world. I am very grateful,” he said after the match. “I am very sorry what happened to them, but I am a professional.”
The last of the Brazilian sides that have given this tournament so much, that have made it feel a little like, well, like a World Cup, now he it was who halted their journey. “It’s not about trying to end that,” he had said the day before.
“I know how important it is for Fluminense and I believe it’s also very important for us. I’m so grateful for everything Fluminense have done for me, but I can’t stop doing my job. May the best team win, and may it be a great spectacle.”
The best team did win, although Marc Cucurella did clear one off the line and Chelsea did need a VAR interception to avoid a Fluminense penalty at 1-0. But in truth it wasn’t especially spectacular. The game wasn’t, anyway. The goals really were.
Out across the Hudson, in a place that is more parking lot than anything else, supporters had begun early occupying the vast, exposed expanses surrounding the MetLife. Heat rose from the floor, the smell of hot Tarmac mixing with tailgate barbecues the Brazilians brought. Huge great grills of meat under gazebos.
Fluminense fans outnumbered Chelsea supporters but there were a lot of blue shirts, too. There was no sign of João Pedro’s 20 among them yet. Cole Palmer, who looks out over Times Square accompanied by the slogan “Scary Good”, appeared the most popular. Others brought a nostalgic touch – there were lots of Lampards out there.
By the time they had gone through the gates, past the sign warning that no weapons were allowed inside, they had missed the US national anthem, belted out to empty stands an hour before kick-off at every game here. They weren’t entirely full by the time the teams came out one player at a time – João Pedro wasn’t the most cheered then, but he would be – but with tickets on sale 17 times cheaper than for Madrid against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, it got quite close: 70,566 came. There was the countdown to kick-off, 3pm on a working day. And then they played.
This wasn’t always the fastest game, nor the most dramatic. It was hot down there – that was shown when it wasn’t just the players who escaped inside at half-time but the fans, too – and it never truly felt like Chelsea would not win. Nor was it a surprise. The identity of the man who carried them there was, and it was written.
“We’re the ugly duckling,” the Fluminense coach, Renato Gaúcho, had said, but one of them had grown, and flown, something beautiful celebrated all round this stadium, his moment shared with everyone.

Workforce diversity data in English football is welcome but transparency seems to have limits,Kick It Out makes ‘moral case for change’ as it finds staffs do not reflect the ethnic makeup of their local communities,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/08/workforce-diversity-data-english-football-welcome-but-transparency-seems-have-limits,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 12:50:54",Matt Hughes,['Manchester United'],"Premier League and EFL clubs were required this year to report details of their workforce diversity data for the first time under a new Football Association regulation. This was aimed at promoting greater equality of opportunities, but even people working in football are hard-pressed to find the numbers.
The clubs published the results of their internal surveys on 1 June, other than Manchester United owing to a website glitch corrected a few days later, but the silence from the sport regarding the findings has been deafening. None of the FA, Premier League or EFL commented on the data or published a summary of the findings, indicating that the drive for greater transparency has its limits.
In one sense, the silence is unsurprising. Analysis of the data conducted by Kick It Out paints a depressing picture of a sport sorely lacking in diversity, with the staff at most clubs not reflecting the ethnic makeup of their local communities.
In the Premier League, 78% of clubs’ workforces are white compared with an average of 66% among the local populations and although there is 13% ethnic diversity in the coaching staff, only two top-flight clubs reported having Black, Asian and minority ethnic coaches in senior roles.
Staff at EFL clubs appear more representative, with 87% of their workforce white compared with an average of 80.8% locally, although clubs in the lower divisions were not required to provide detailed breakdowns of staff roles so the figures for coaches are unclear.
Kick It Out’s chief executive, Samuel Okafor, welcomed the publication of the data, although there was no disguising his disappointment at the findings. “For many years we as an organisation have been calling for the game to be more transparent and bring more data into the light,” he said. “It’s really positive the FA have brought out a new rule that means all 92 clubs have to publish their workforce data.
“What the data has shown us is probably not a surprise to us or to many people. When we look at Black, Asian, ethnically diverse staff, whether that’s in boardrooms, in senior leadership roles, in coaching or senior coaching, you can see there’s a huge lack of representation. When we look at women in boardrooms and senior leadership roles, in coaching, we can again see there is a huge underrepresentation. Representation of LGBTQ people and those with disabilities is very low.
“Some of these data points will not be a surprise to many, but having it in the light is positive for driving change and accountability.”
Okafor has been at Kick It Out for just under a year after replacing Tony Burnett, who before retiring last summer called for sanctions for clubs that failed to meet diversity targets.
The FA created the new rule after mixed results from the Football Leadership Diversity Code, a voluntary reporting requirement introduced in 2020. Fifty-three clubs had signed up by last season and none had met the eight hiring targets to increase diversity among staff.
FA sources indicated they were in the process of analysing the data. The governing body plans to submit a report to all stakeholders, including the Premier League, EFL and Kick It Out, before discussing the issue publicly at a Football Leadership Diversity summit in the autumn.
Okafor regards mandatory publication as a step forward, but there remain concerns over a lack of transparency. Many of the Premier League clubs reported high rates of “prefer not to say” regarding ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability and did not report data for roles with fewer than 10 staff members, leading to a lack of visibility regarding coaching posts. Many clubs also use the catch-all “under 10%” rather than giving exact figures, making it hard to accurately assess representation, especially for smaller demographic groups.
Okafor spent 20 years in the banking industry after a playing career that peaked with Colchester in League One, most recently as a director at the private bank Coutts, and believes football lags behind in terms of recruitment practices. EFL clubs have had access to an anonymised recruitment platform, iRecruit, for two years but it is unclear how widely it is used.
“The banking sector is ahead when it comes to transparency, when it comes to target setting,” Okafor said. “There’s still a massive way to go in terms of getting the right level of representation across the game.
“There’s also an opportunity to look at some of the best practices that happen in other industries and how do you bring them into football. We need diverse shortlists and interview panels, all those inclusive practices, so it’s not the select few that are getting those jobs.”
Okafor is eager to make the economic case for having a diverse workforce. “We will continue to talk about the moral case for change, but there’s a real commercial benefit when you have a diverse workforce, when you have a diverse leadership team that looks like the club’s community, and when you have a diverse coaching staff … You can’t just have EDI [equality, diversity and inclusion] over on one side and financial sustainability on the other side. You really need to bring the two together.”

Spanish police believe Diogo Jota was speeding when he and his brother died,Police say it appears Liverpool player was driving,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/08/diogo-jota-speeding-spanish-police-believe-died-brother,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 14:10:04",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Spanish police suspect Diogo Jota was driving over the speed limit when he and his brother were killed in a car crash last week.
The 28-year-old Liverpool and Portugal forward died with his 25-year-old brother André Silva when the Lamborghini in which they were travelling careered off a road in the province of Zamora last Thursday.
Spain’s Civil Guard said on Tuesday that while its investigation into the accident was not complete, it believed the car was being driven at more than the 120km/h (75mph) speed limit when it had a suspected tyre blowout.
For the first time since the crash, which happened 11 days after Jota married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, the police also said they believed the Liverpool player was driving the car.
A spokesperson for the Civil Guard said: “The expert report is being carried out and finished, where among other things they are studying the marks left by one of the wheels of the vehicle. Everything also points to a possible high excess of speed over the permitted speed of the road. All the tests carried out for the moment point to the fact that the driver of the vehicle was Diogo Jota.”
The report will be handed to the court in Puebla de Sanabria, Zamora, when the investigation is completed.
Jota and Silva died when the car left the A52 in north-west Spain and burst into flames. They are believed to have been heading to the northern Spanish port of Santander to take a ferry to England before Jota’s return to Liverpool for pre-season training, having been advised not to fly after Jota had a recent lung procedure. The brothers were buried in their home city of Gondomar near Porto on Saturday.
Jota’s Liverpool teammates, most of whom attended the funeral, began reporting back for pre-season training on Tuesday. Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson, who posted emotional tributes to their friend, were among the contingent who arrived at the Axa Training Centre for pre-season tests along with the new signing Jeremie Frimpong. Tributes to Jota were left near the players’ entrance to the training ground.
Liverpool delayed the start of pre-season after Jota’s death and the full squad is not expected back until Thursday. The Premier League champions are scheduled to play their first friendly at Preston on Sunday.

‘Something to be proud of’: Maresca delighted as Chelsea reach Club World Cup final,Chelsea manager pleased with João Pedro contribution,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/09/enzo-maresca-delighted-chelsea-reach-club-world-cup-final,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 23:01:53",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"Enzo Maresca did not hide his pride after Chelsea set up a final against either Real Madrid or Paris Saint‑Germain after defeating Fluminense with two brilliant goals from João Pedro.
Maresca’s team encountered few problems as they maintained their push for Club World Cup glory after producing an impressive performance to defeat the last non-European team left in the competition.
Chelsea took huge satisfaction from seeing João Pedro mark his full debut by scoring twice against his boyhood club. The forward joined from Brighton for £60m last week and was pivotal in his new team moving to within one win from being crowned club world champions.
“We are very happy, very proud to play the final on Sunday,” Maresca said.“The reason why is because this is the first edition of the Club World Cup. The best clubs in the world are here. For us to be in the final is something to be proud of.
“I know how difficult it is with all the games. Premier League top four, we won the Conference League and now a final here – it is fantastic.”
Maresca was delighted with João Pedro’s impressive display after coming in for the suspended Liam Delap. “I am very happy for João,” the head coach said. “He has quality to decide the game like today. We know he is a good player against teams that defend deep.”
There was concern for Chelsea after Moisés Caicedo limped off with a twisted ankle during the closing stages. The midfielder wanted to shake off the knock but had to admit defeat. “He felt he could try even though I told him we could play with 10 players,” Maresca said. “He tried and felt pain. So hopefully he can be fit for Sunday.”
Maresca said that Dário Essugo, a possible replacement for Caicedo, will miss the rest of the tournament after sustaining an injury in training. The Italian also looked ahead to facing either PSG or Madrid, who meet on Wednesday in the second semi-final.
“They are both top teams,” Maresca said. “One won the Champions League this season, the other one last season. They are top teams but we are proud to be there.”

Like a group of lads nervously assembling at an airport pub before jetting off on yet another bonfire of a stag do, Manchester United’s first-team players – well, at least some of them – this week shuffled back into whatever the training ground is called these days, with a few even attempting what was known in the 1990s and the 2000s at Carrington as a smile!

That is because the club has reportedly canned the idea for an Amazon fly-on-the-wall documentary to follow the team’s every move, a visionary idea that could have been one of the hit comedy series of the year but is now consigned to the bin after some actual adults decided that a warts-and-all video record of another underwhelming campaign might not have been the right technique to retain all those legacy fans, blue-chip sponsorship deals and key performance indicators. Perhaps swayed by the way United’s bizarre decision to choose cash (around £8m) over common sense in sending the squad on a disastrous post-season tour of Asia mightily backfired, further damaging the club’s image and draining their players, United have now pulled the plug on the latest incarnation of the All or Nothing series, a sports documentary format originally made popular by the ‘Sunderland ‘Til I Die’ series.
Just how closely United’s 2025-26 campaign resembles the Black Cats’ 2017-18 season – in which Sunderland were relegated to League One after finishing dead last in the Championship – remains to be seen, but if the Amazon documentary had gone ahead in Manchester, it would have been fun to see what music Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe would like to be played on the PA system inside Old Trafford, and who (Casemiro?!) can do a good Jack Rodwell impression?

QUOTE OF THE DAY
I didn’t feel respected or anything and I said to myself: ‘I need to put myself into places where I’ll be recognised for doing well.’ I think a lot of English players, they don’t realise … they would rather stay in the Championship their whole life if they could, whereas I don’t think like that” – London-born winger Tyler Burey speaks to Will Unwin about his journey from Carlisle United to Bosnia and Herzegovina champions Zrinjski Mostar, who start their Bigger Cup qualifying campaign on Tuesday against Virtus of San Marino.

"Transfer latest: Leeds close on Newcastle’s Longstaff, Spurs land defender Takai",Longstaff poised for £10m exit as Elanga nears medical,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/08/transfer-latest-leeds-sean-longstaff-newcastle-spurs-sign-kota-takai-defender,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 16:40:28",Louise Taylor,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Leeds are inching closer to signing the midfielder Sean Longstaff from Newcastle for an initial £10m, potentially rising to £12m. The 27-year-old, who joined Newcastle’s academy almost 20 years ago, lost his first-team place to Sandro Tonali last season. With one year on his contract, the clubs have spent recent weeks discussing a long-mooted move.
A transfer that will be registered as pure profit for Newcastle under the Premier League’s spending rules, given Longstaff’s homegrown status, appears imminent. With Longstaff keen on relocating to Leeds, personal terms will not represent a problem for a player whose experience should help Leeds adapt to the top tier after promotion.
While Newcastle’s pursuit of the Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford continues – the fee remains a sticking point – Eddie Howe is close to welcoming one of his top summer targets, the Nottingham Forest right-winger Anthony Elanga.
With the final touches being applied to Elanga’s £55m move, the Swede is expected to undergo a medical in the next 48 hours and be reunited with his international teammate Alexander Isak.
Newcastle remain in the market for a right-sided central defender and retain an interest in the Atalanta 21-year-old Giorgio Scalvini, who impressed in Serie A last season.
With Callum Wilson having departed, a striker to understudy Isak is required and Newcastle have been offered Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has left Everton. Although Howe has previously expressed interest in signing Calvert-Lewin, a move is unlikely until later in the transfer window.
Kota Takai has completed a £5m move to Tottenham from Kawasaki Frontale in Japan to become the first signing of the Thomas Frank era. The 20-year-old centre-half, who is 6ft 3in and known for his strength, speed and comfort on the ball, has signed a five-year contract.
Takai swells the club’s extensive options in the middle of the backline, which start with the first-choice partnership from last season – Cristian Romero and Micky Van de Ven. Frank will also be able to call upon Kevin Danso, Radu Dragusin and Luka Vuskovic, the 18-year-old who has joined for £12m from Hajduk Split.
Romero’s future at Spurs is unclear. The Argentina international, one of the vice-captains under Frank’s predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, has made no secret of his desire to play in Spain and he has been openly courted by Atlético Madrid. Spurs, though, would not sell for less than £60m, a figure that may prove beyond Atlético. Romero is under contract to 2027.
Takai came through the youth ranks at Kawasaki Frontale, the club that produced the Brighton winger Kaoru Mitoma, making his debut for them as a 17-year-old. He won the Japanese Cup in 2023, was named as the J-League’s best young player in 2024 and this year helped his club to reach the AFC Champions League final – which they lost to Ivan Toney’s Al-Ahli.
Takai played in every minute of the knockout rounds and won plaudits in the semi-final victory over Al-Nassr when he kept Cristiano Ronaldo and Jhon Durán quiet. Takai made his Japan debut last September and has four caps.
Spurs remain in talks with West Ham over the winger Mohammed Kudus after having an opening offer of £50m turned down. They have loaned the 21-year-old forward Alejo Véliz back to his former club Rosario Central for the season.
Arsenal have confirmed the appointment of the former Manchester United defender Gabriel Heinze as their first-team coach after the departure of Carlos Cuesta last month. Heinze, who spent three years at United and helped them win the Premier League title in 2007, has managed in Argentina and the United States and was a teammate of Mikel Arteta’s at Paris Saint-Germain.
Cuesta left to join Parma after five years at the Emirates, becoming the second-youngest head coach in Serie A history. Arsenal are looking for an under-21s coach after Mehmet Ali joined the backroom staff of the new Brentford manager, Keith Andrews.

Moyes contends with thin squad as Everton’s era of short-termism catches up with club,"With only 16 players in the squad after contracts and loans ended, reliance on temporary measures beckons again",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/08/david-moyes-thin-squad-everton-era-short-termism-catches-up-with-club,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 13:41:09",Andy Hunter,['Manchester City'],"The vast scale of the overhaul required at Everton this summer had David Moyes worried. The start of pre-season has indicated why. The squad that reported on Sunday for a training camp in St Andrews contained 15 senior players in its ranks and numerous holes to fill. Progress is being made behind the scenes to repair the damage of the Farhad Moshiri years, but there is no easy fix.
Everton’s senior contingent will rise to 16 now that Idrissa Gueye has followed Michael Keane in signing a new contract, a week after becoming a free agent. Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, laments having 32 senior players on the books at Manchester City and could afford to omit Jack Grealish from his 27-man squad for the Club World Cup. There is no level playing field in the Premier League.
Everton’s squad in Scotland includes the 21-year-old striker Youssef Chermiti and the 22‑year‑old midfielder Tim Iroegbunam, who have started a combined seven Premier League games for the club. Another two, the first-choice centre-backs James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite, are working their way back to fitness after sustaining serious hamstring injuries at the end of last season.
In terms of players with Premier League experience, Moyes has one goalkeeper (Jordan Pickford), three full-backs (Séamus Coleman, Nathan Patterson and Vitalii Mykolenko), four central defenders (Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Keane and Jake O’Brien), three central midfielders (Gueye, Iroegbunam and James Garner), one attacking midfielder (Carlos Alcaraz), two wide men (Dwight McNeil and Iliman Ndiaye) and two forwards (Chermiti and Beto). Only central defence has the numbers required for a Premier League campaign. From an academy that has lost many promising talents in recent years because of financial problems higher up the chain, only the 18-year-old midfielder Harrison Armstrong appears in a position to press his first-team claims.
Alcaraz is Everton’s one signing of the summer transfer window, for an attractive price of £12.6m, having impressed while on loan from Flamengo last season. The club are edging closer to a second in the form of the Villarreal striker Thierno Barry after making a breakthrough in discussions on an initial £27.5m fee for the 6ft 5in France Under‑21 international last week.
The to-do list will remain extensive, even if the Barry deal gets over the line. Moyes wants more options and quality out wide, in central midfield and at right‑back. He needs cover for Pickford and competition for Mykolenko at left‑back. There is money available thanks to new owners, The Friedkin Group, and the easing – but not the eradication – of Premier League profitability and sustainability rule pressures, though not enough to address every flaw. The loan market and free agents will have to be used once again.
Before the final game of last season, a win at Newcastle, Moyes was asked whether he was worried about the extent of the rebuild required. “Yes I am,” he said. “I don’t think it’s something you’d have ideally as any manager, such a big changeover. I knew we had this situation when I came into the job. There is a chance for big change but it’s easier said than done. You want to build layer after layer. We have five loan players. Most clubs have one or at worst two. That alone gives you an idea.”
Four of those five loanees – Orel Mangala, Jesper Lindstrøm, Jack Harrison and Armando Broja – have since returned to their parent clubs, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Abdoulaye Doucouré, Ashley Young, João Virgínia, Asmir Begovic, Neal Maupay and Mason Holgate have left after the expiry of their contracts. Only Maupay brought in a fee, £3.4m from Marseille. Eleven out and one in. The necessary short-termism and cut‑price deals that characterised the final years of Moshiri’s reign, as Everton sought to avoid further punishment from the Premier League, have inevitably caught up with the club.
The man largely responsible for navigating that minefield, Kevin Thelwell, left his role as Everton’s director of football this summer after TFG decided to change the club’s leadership structure. The former head of recruitment Dan Purdy has followed Thelwell to Rangers. Everton now have a football leadership team instead of a director of football model, with Moyes having significant input alongside the new chief executive, Angus Kinnear.
TFG’s and Kinnear’s recruitment is encouraging. They have appointed the former Manchester United academy director Nick Cox as technical director. He is responsible for ensuring all aspects at Finch Farm training ground – medical, operations, facilities and player care – are at an elite level, including for the women’s team and academy.
Nick Hammond – a former director of football at Reading, head of football operations at Celtic and transfer consultant at Leeds and Newcastle – now leads Everton’s player trading, and Chris Howarth heads the club’s football strategy and analytics operations. As part of Howarth’s arrival, TFG acquired his Insight Sport data consultancy. Everton have also recruited James Smith, director of scouting and recruitment at the City Football Group, to become their new director of scouting and recruitment, although he does not start until September.
The overhaul at the top will need time to bring the change required at playing level but, as the new five‑year contract for Branthwaite demonstrates, progress is being made to build on the recovery Moyes instigated last season. The Scot believes change should be incremental. That is not an option this summer.
