Arteta: Arsenal '100 per cent' followed right processes over Partey,"Mikel Arteta has claimed Arsenal ""100 per cent"" followed the right processes over Thomas Partey after the midfielder was charged over multiple counts of rape and sexual assault earlier this month.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399487/thomas-partey-mikel-arteta-says-arsenal-100-per-cent-followed-right-processes-after-player-charged-over-multiple-counts-of-rape-and-sexual-assault,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 06:41:00",,['Arsenal'],"Mikel Arteta has claimed Arsenal ""100 per cent"" followed the right processes over Thomas Partey after the midfielder was charged over multiple counts of rape and sexual assault earlier this month.
The former Arsenal midfielder was charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. The charges relate to three women and the offences are reported to have taken place between 2021 and 2022.
Partey - who denies the charges - was first arrested in July 2022, though he was not named at the time and continued to play for Arsenal while investigations were ongoing.
The 32-year-old's Arsenal contract expired on June 30 and Partey was charged four days later. In a statement to Sky Sports News, Arsenal said: ""The player's contract ended on June 30. Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case.""
And speaking for the first time since Partey was charged, Arsenal manager Arteta addressed the situation while on the club's pre-season tour in Singapore.
""The club was very clear in its statement,"" said Arteta. ""There are a lot of legal matters that are very complicated so I cannot comment on any of that.""
Asked if he feels confident and comfortable that the club followed all the right processes, Arteta said: ""100 per cent.""
Two counts of rape relate to one woman, three counts of rape relate to a second woman and one count of sexual assault relates to a third woman.
Partey is due to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court on August 5.
""The charges follow an investigation by detectives, which commenced in February 2022 after police first received a report of rape,"" according to the Met Police statement.
Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy, whose team is leading the investigation, said: ""Our priority remains providing support to the women who have come forward.""
Anyone who has information about the case, or has been impacted by it, is being asked to contact the Met Police.
In a statement made on the day of his charge, Partey's lawyer Jenny Wiltshire of Hickman and Rose, said: ""Thomas Partey denies all the charges against him. He has fully cooperated with the police and CPS throughout their three-year investigation. He now welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name.
""Given that there are now ongoing legal proceedings, my client is unable to comment further.""

Mbeumo completes Man Utd medical - striker next?,Manchester United's move for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has entered the final stages of completion.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399290/bryan-mbeumo-transfer-news-brentford-forward-completes-man-utd-medical-ahead-of-71m-move-to-old-trafford,"Sun, 20 Jul 2025 14:50:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United's move for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has entered the final stages of completion.
It is understood Mbeumo has completed his medical and formalised the details on a long-term contract.
There is an expectation that everything will be sorted in time for him to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.
After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package on Friday that includes a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.
United had been in talks with Brentford for over month for Mbeumo, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.
That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.
But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.
It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable - mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.
If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.
The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.
United had been encouraged and impressed by Mbeumo's desire to join them, but Brentford have made it clear they would find it difficult to sell both him and Yoane Wissa, with interest intensifying in the Congo striker in the last week.
Newcastle stepped their pursuit after seeing Liverpool move ahead of them in the race for Hugo Ekitike. Nottingham Forest also had a bid rejected for Wissa, while Spurs have been considering him since January.
It may be the case that this shift in dynamic around Wissa sparked United into their successful offer for Mbeumo, with a striker next on the agenda for Amorim and the recruitment hierarchy.
As Sky Sports News has been reporting all summer, United have been looking at No 9s.
They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.
Sky Sports News has been told one to keep an eye on as the window develops is RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.
A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.
Barcelona have reached a broad agreement to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.
Sky Sports Data Editor Adam Smith:
Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.
He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.
Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.
Only Mohamed Salah collected more form points than Mbeumo last term, according to the Sky Sports Power Rankings.
Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

Arteta: I can't talk about Gyokeres... yet,Mikel Arteta has said he cannot comment on Arsenal's pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres... yet.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399511/viktor-gyokeres-transfer-news-arsenal-manager-mikel-arteta-remains-coy-on-signing-sporting-cp-striker,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 08:05:00",Sam Blitz,['Arsenal'],"Mikel Arteta has said he cannot comment on Arsenal's pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres... yet.
It has been over a week since Arsenal agreed a fixed fee of £55m for the Sporting CP forward, after making a breakthrough in talks with the Portuguese club.
However, negotiations are still ongoing over the add-ons as part of the deal, with Sporting holding out for €10m (£8.7m). Further talks last week have been around the conditions of those bonus payments.
Arsenal have since departed on their pre-season tour to Singapore and Hong Kong, with Arteta asked about whether Gyokeres will become a Gunners player before the start of the new season.
""I cannot comment on any player who is not part of our group yet,"" said Arteta. ""When we have something concrete to offer in any case to any player we will do that.""
So far this summer, Arsenal have completed deals for Kepa Arrizabalaga, Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard and Noni Madueke - in a busy start to their first summer window under new sporting director Andrea Berta.
Gyokeres is not the only outstanding Arsenal deal in the pipeline with an initial £13m deal for Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera close to completion.
""I'm very pleased, that's all I'll say,"" said Arteta about Arsenal's business so far.
""There are a lot of parties and things that we have to bear in mind to get a player over the line and here. I'm very hopeful that we are going to do it very soon.""
Asked if he expects any new players to join Arsenal on their tour of Asia, Arteta replied: ""There's still a long time in the window and we are seeking still, in terms of numbers, we are short and we have to improve the depth and quality of the squad.
""We are constantly looking in the market. Until that happens, focus on the players we have and focus on them and I'm very pleased with what I have seen in the last 10-15 days.""
Arteta also addressed the Gunners' purchase of Martin Zubimendi - with the Arsenal manager revealing the Spanish midfielder turned down ""some very good opportunities"" to move to north London.
Zubimendi was close to a move to Liverpool last summer but opted to stay at Real Sociedad for another year.
Arsenal then swooped in for the Spaniard with Arteta playing his role in convincing the midfielder to choose the Gunners instead.
""It was a long, long process,"" said Arteta about the pursuit of Zubimendi.
""He had a lot of opportunities to decide whether he wanted to come and and the good news is that this club is is amazing and everybody wants to come to it. And he left some very good opportunities to come to us and he's very impressive.
""I think we are all very impressed with what we've seen in the last seven to ten days because once you have the player daily there and you see his character, you see his personality , his intelligence and how much it's going to bring to the team, very excited about it.""

Sky Sports News understands the total package in the offer could rise to £78m (€90m), but talks continue over the structure of the add-ons.
Both parties are confident of getting to a full agreement, but there is still work to do to get it finalised.
Liverpool made their move for Ekitike earlier this week after being told Newcastle's Alexander Isak is not for sale.
Ekitike is open to a Premier League move and Liverpool would be his preferred destination, after Newcastle had an offer rejected.
The 23-year-old was an unused substitute during his side's pre-season game against FSV Frankfurt on Saturday. After the game, Frankfurt boss, quoted by Sky Germany, said Ekitike's potential departure is ""a bitter loss"".
Ekitike scored 22 goals in 48 games across all competitions last season for Frankfurt as he helped them qualify for the Champions League.
Sky Sports' Adam Bate:
When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.
""These were players with similar profiles from teams that were better than our team, but not at the distance Paris Saint-Germain were from us,"" Oscar Garcia, Reims' then head coach, told Sky Sports. ""We challenged him to reach the level of the other two strikers.""
On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.
He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. ""Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.""
It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League.
""He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,"" concedes Oscar. ""They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.""

Arteta '100%' sure Arsenal followed right processes over Partey,"Manager Mikel Arteta says Arsenal followed the right processes when dealing with former midfielder Thomas Partey, who played while under police investigation for multiple counts of rape.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c784p9z2dnmo,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 07:12:29",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says he is ""100%"" sure the club followed the right processes when dealing with former midfielder Thomas Partey, who was under police investigation for multiple counts of rape while he was playing for the club.
The Ghana midfielder, 32, left Arsenal at the end of his contract on 30 June and four days later was charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.
The offences are reported to have taken place in 2021 and 2022, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement on 4 July.
The charges involve three women, with two counts of rape relating to one woman, three counts of rape in connection to a second woman and one count of sexual assault linked to a third woman.
Partey denies the charges and ""welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name"", his lawyer has said.
Detectives started a investigation in February 2022 after police first received a report of rape.
Arsenal are in Singapore for their pre-season tour. They play AC Milan and Newcastle before travelling to Hong Kong to play Tottenham.
Arteta was asked in a news conference before they play Milan on Wednesday about the situation with Partey.
""The club was very clear in its statement,"" Arteta said. ""There are a lot of legal matters that are very complicated so I cannot comment on any of that.""
He was then asked: ""A lot of fans have questions over the way in which the matter was handled by the club. Do you feel confident and comfortable that the club followed all the right processes in that?""
Arteta answered: ""100%, yes.""
Partey is expected to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 5 August.
He joined Arsenal for £45m from Atletico Madrid in October 2020.
He made 35 appearances in the Premier League last season and scored four goals as Arsenal finished second.
He also played 12 times in the Champions League as the Gunners reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by eventual winners Paris St-Germain.

Gabriel says things will be 'different' at Arsenal 'after letting titles slip',"Arsenal defender Gabriel Magalhaes says ""things will be different"" this season after missing out on the Premier League title again.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c07dyv57vnjo,"Sun, 20 Jul 2025 15:05:48",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Gabriel Magalhaes believes this season ""will be different"" for Arsenal after admitting they have ""let a couple of titles slip through our fingers"" in recent years.
Mikel Arteta has transformed the Gunners since taking over almost six years ago, but they have not won major silverware since FA Cup success in 2020 - his first season in charge.
The Gunners have finished second in the Premier League for three successive years and lost in the semi-finals of both the Champions League and Carabao Cup last season - to eventual winners Paris St-Germain and Newcastle respectively.
As Arsenal begin their pre-season tour of Singapore and Hong Kong, BBC Sport looks at the changes that needed to be made in an attempt to lift a trophy for the first time in five years.
The need to avoid lengthy lay-offs
Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli all spent lengthy spells on the sidelines last season, which disrupted Arsenal's attack.
Striker Gabriel Jesus also missed a large part of the campaign with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and - with other recognised attackers out - midfielder Mikel Merino ended up playing as a makeshift centre-forward.
Merino did well - scoring seven times in 28 Premier League games and hitting an important goal in the victory over Real Madrid in the Champions League - but Arteta will want to avoid such a scenario this season.
It wasn't all bad for the Gunners, of course, as those injuries allowed academy products Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri to break into the first team.
Lewis-Skelly has since gone on to make his debut for England and sign a new long-term deal.
Nwaneri is close to doing the same - after scoring nine goals in 37 appearances.
""I don't think we can give excuses,""  Gabriel, 27, told BBC Sport. ""We did everything we could in the last three years. I feel like we had a little bit of bad luck sometimes, but we all believe that we can win big titles.
""We're focused on what our manager is telling us to do, and what we have to do, and what we have to improve. I think this year will be different.""
Signing 'great players' like Gyokeres
Arsenal have been busy in the transfer market and will have several new faces in their squad when they start their Premier League season at Manchester United on Sunday, 17 August.
The Gunners have already signed winger Noni Madueke, midfielders Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard, and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. They are also working to complete transfers for striker Viktor Gyokeres and young defender Cristhian Mosquera.
Zubimendi is one of the most highly rated defensive midfielders in Europe.
Premier League champions Liverpool tried to sign him last season, and he played a crucial role in the Euro 2024 final as a half-time substitute as Spain beat England.
Alongside him, Arsenal have brought in midfielder Norgaard from Brentford to provide experience now Jorginho and Thomas Partey have departed.
Madueke is seen as ideal back-up for Saka, but also someone who can play on both wings, challenge Martinelli for his position, and continue developing his own game.
""I think the players that came will help us out a lot,"" Gabriel said.
""The club is doing what is best for the players and the manager. They are definitely doing their best to bring the best players that can help us, but we have to focus on what we can do out on the pitch.
""The players that are here are doing that. We are strong and we are getting stronger with these new players.
""Definitely, it excites me. We want to have the best players. To be in the dispute for titles, you have to have the best players.""
Arsenal will hope the expected arrival of Gyokeres from Sporting will bring goals, with the Swede having scored 54 in 52 games last season.
Gabriel has played against Gyokeres, and mimicked the forward's celebration after scoring in Arsenal's 5-0 win over Sporting in November in the Champions League.
""We all know he is a great player, but he is a Sporting player not an Arsenal player,"" Gabriel said.
""Playing against him last year was a challenge. He is great and had a great season. About the celebration, it is something I can't talk about right now.""
The desire to 'win big titles'
Gabriel missed the final weeks of last season after injuring a hamstring in April. He had surgery to fix the problem and is working to be fit for the beginning of the season.
The Brazilian has signed a contract that will keep him at the club until 2029 - and says he ""didn't hear"" about links with a move to Saudi Arabia.
The feeling around Arsenal is they are ready to take the next step, and feel confident to say publicly they are ready to lift a trophy.
""I've been at the club for five years now and I've seen how much the club has grown."" added Gabriel, who was speaking before the club's pre-season tour, where the Gunners will play AC Milan on 23 July and Newcastle on 27 July in the Singapore Festival of Football.
""I am here to win big titles and I do believe that this season will be different. We have let a couple of titles slip through our fingers recently.
""We almost won but I think this year, things will be different. I have a lot of faith in that.""

Football transfer rumours: McAtee to West Ham?

Over the last few years, James Trafford, Morgan Rogers, Roméo Lavia, Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Douglas Luiz and Cole Palmer have all been allowed to leave Manchester City before proving their former manager wrong, and James McAtee could become the latest addition to that list. His price has been set at £35m; both West Ham and Eintracht Frankfurt are interested.
Across Manchester, the opposite is so: rather than leave to get good, players arrive to get bad. Bryan Mbeumo is the latest to jeopardise his prospects and reputation and, with his medical complete, his transfer from Brentford will soon be finalised. But to leave requisite appalling mess prior to getting sacked during the November international break, Ruben Amorim needs more, and a centre-forward is next on his list. He still fancies ruining Viktor Gyökeres, for whom Arsenal have been unable to do a deal with Sporting, but Pio Esposito will be remaining at Inter despite interest from United and Atalanta.
Talking of Arsenal, Real Madrid are reportedly keeping an eye on William Saliba. It may be that the tantalising glory of becoming the first club to win the Coming-second-four-seasons-in-a-row trophy is enough to keep him at the Emirates, but it may also be that he can once again hoodwink himself they’re poised to win the league.
Madrid are also considering a low-ball bid for Ibrahima Konaté, who is out of contract at the end of the season. But they are also happy to wait until the summer, when his costly lapses in concentration can be theirs for free.
In other centre-back news, Cristian Romero is contemplating leaving Tottenham – which, if his defending is anything to go by, is a decision he’ll make as rashly and unfathomably furious as possible. Should he depart, the club would like to replace him with Bournemouth’s Illia Zabarnyi and are prepared to pay an asking price that could exceed €70m. It’s true that Paris Saint-Germain are also interested, but the chance to represent the Europa League champions of Europe will surely prove too tempting.
Elsewhere in the Premier League, Leeds are hoping a bidding war will ensue for Mateo Joseph – or, as the headline has him, “Emile Heskey’s relative”. It remains unclear whether this connection is a help or a hindrance in drumming up interest, but the anticipated stampede is well under way: Celta Vigo both lead and complete the throng of clubs said to be interested in the Spain Under-21 forward. Any proceeds of sale will be used to bring Fulham’s Rodrigo Muniz to Elland Road.
Finally for today, Jacob Ramsey would like to leave Aston Villa and there is interest in him from Nottingham Forest, Everton and Spurs. He may yet decide to stay put.

Liverpool continue talks over signing Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt,Reports of £69m deal being agreed said to be premature,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/20/liverpool-continue-talks-over-signing-hugo-ekitike-from-eintracht-frankfurt-football-transfer-window,"Sun, 20 Jul 2025 11:56:44",John Brewin,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool continue to be in negotiations over the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitike. Sources at the Premier League champions say reports in Germany of a deal being agreed for a £69m fee are premature, although it is believed that the France Under-21s forward does favour a move to Anfield.
Ekitike is expected to eventually join Liverpool as they look to overhaul their striking department, a situation further necessitated by the death of Diogo Jota this month.
Luis Díaz could well depart from Merseyside, with Bayern Munich an interested party in the Colombia international, and Darwin Núñez is still very much for sale despite a move to Napoli the Uruguayan wanted having gone cold. Neither departure will be at a cut price.
A deal for the 23-year-old Ekitike, who has an £86m release clause in his contract with Frankfurt, continues to be negotiated despite reports of Alexander Isak, in whom Liverpool are known to be interested, being unsettled at Newcastle. Eddie Howe left the Swede out of the squad that lost 4‑0 at Celtic in a pre‑season friendly on Saturday, with the manager admitting later it was because of recent transfer speculation. Howe did go on to say, however, that he was “confident [Isak] will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window”.
Liverpool are prepared to pay a British record transfer fee to make Isak their new No 9 but the chances of them signing – or indeed being able to afford – the 25-year-old forward remain remote, hence the stepping up of their interest in Ekitike.
Isak has also been linked with Arsenal, as previously was Ekitike, who scored 22 goals and provided 12 assists in all competitions for Frankfurt last season.
Liverpool have already signed Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez this summer, with Giorgi Mamardashvili linking up with the club after agreeing a move last August.

The former Tottenham full-back joins Graham Potter to continue the Hammers’ summer business, which has been slow going so far.
“He was a big, big part of me making the decision,” Walker-Peters said of Potter. “I’ve always liked his style as a coach and I think it’s going to suit me best. He spoke about trying to make the club like a real family feel and that’s what I’m all about and I’d like to think I’m a good fit.”
Walker-Peters, who won two caps for England in 2022, spent five years at Southampton, enduring two relegations, and now joins a club whose other summer signings have been El Hadji Malick Diouf, a left-wing back from Slavia Prague, and the youngster Daniel Cummings from Celtic. Walker-Peters is likely to play on the right.
Potter said: “He is a player I’ve always thought highly of and been impressed by whenever he has faced one of my teams. He has a really good pedigree, a top professional who has established himself as a respected Premier League player and still has his best years in front of him.”
Meanwhile, Evan Ferguson, the Republic of Ireland striker, has travelled to Italy to complete a loan move from Brighton to Roma. On Sunday evening footage emerged of Ferguson being greeted by around a hundred fans at the airport after flying over in a private plane.
Speaking from Las Palmas, where Brighton are preparing for a pre-season friendly with the Spanish club, the Albion manager, Fabian Hürzeler, said Ferguson still remains part of Brighton’s future plans. The aim of the season-long loan is to reboot a career affected by injuries and loss of form under Hürzeler and his predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi.
“For us it is always important the individual players have an environment where they can develop, we decided the loan was the best option for us,” said Hürzeler. “He is still a player of us, he still brings quality with him, he is a target player and I am sure when he gets more game time he will one day be back and be an important player for us.”
In Italy, there had been reports a deal has been agreed for an initial loan with a €40m (£34.5m) option to buy. Ferguson spent half of last season on loan at West Ham, a disappointing spell during which he started just one match and failed to score for Potter, the manager who first blooded him at Brighton. Ferguson signed a six-year deal in 2023.
