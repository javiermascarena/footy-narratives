Ekitike set for medical after Liverpool agree £79m deal,Hugo Ekitike is expected to arrive in the UK on Tuesday for a medical and to finalise a six-year contract after Liverpool reached a total agreement in principle with Eintracht Frankfurt over a deal worth &#163;79m (&#8364;91.5m).,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399592/hugo-ekitike-transfer-news-liverpool-agree-79m-deal-eintracht-frankfurt-striker,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 10:58:00",,['Liverpool'],"Hugo Ekitike is expected to arrive in the UK on Tuesday for a medical and to finalise a six-year contract after Liverpool reached a total agreement in principle with Eintracht Frankfurt over a deal worth £79m (€91.5m).
Liverpool are understood to have kept a contingent of staff in the UK to complete the signing and, once it has been, it is hoped the player will be able to fly to Asia to join the team on their pre‑season tour later in the week.
Similar to the Florian Wirtz deal, the majority of the bonuses in Ekitike's are tied to Liverpool trophy success and the player making a significant contribution. They are difficult to achieve, but Liverpool would feel happy if they end up paying them.
Sky Sports News broke the news earlier that Liverpool have reached a total agreement with Eintracht Frankfurt worth £79m, made up of £69m plus £10m in add-ons.
Liverpool made their move for Ekitike last week after being told Newcastle's Alexander Isak is not for sale.
Ekitike is keen on a move to the Premier League with Liverpool his preferred destination, after Newcastle had an offer rejected.
The 23-year-old was an unused substitute during his side's pre-season game against FSV Frankfurt on Saturday. After the game, Frankfurt boss, quoted by Sky Germany, said Ekitike's potential departure is ""a bitter loss"".
Ekitike scored 22 goals in 48 games across all competitions last season for Frankfurt as he helped them qualify for the Champions League.
Liverpool are now the Premier League's biggest spenders, with their summer spree now verging on £300m.
The £79m agreed deal for Hugo Ekitike has taken Liverpool's spending to £295.5m, which is over £75m more than the next biggest spenders in Chelsea.
Liverpool have even spent more than Manchester City and Arsenal combined - the third and fourth biggest spenders - so far.
Tottenham are the fourth biggest spenders with £110.7m spent, just above newly-promoted Sunderland who have spent £107m already.
But how can Liverpool afford Ekitike having already spent a club-record fee to bring Florian Wirtz to Anfield earlier this summer?
Well, the club's financial records indicated they could potentially lose a further £200m this summer and still be compliant with Profit & Sustainability Rules (PSR) - where clubs are permitted to lose £105m over a three-year period.
According to football finance expert Swiss Ramble, the Reds' most recent financial results showed Liverpool have actually made £48m in the current three-year PSR period, partly due to modest recent transfer spend.
That means Liverpool can lose a further £158m and still be compliant next summer.
And while Liverpool have already spent around £185m on new players in the current window - including a fee of up to £116m for Wirtz - the Reds posted a club record revenue of £613.8m for the 2023-24 season, partly due to commercial success.
That figure will only increase on the 2024-25 season accounts given Liverpool added Champions League football, knockout qualification for that tournament and also became Premier League champions.
Academy product Jarell Quansah has already joined Bayer Leverkusen in a £35m deal that represents 100 per cent profit under PSR rules, and the Reds could further boost sales figures by the end of the summer.
And earlier in the summer, Brentford signed backup Reds goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher for an initial £12.5m.
Darwin Nunez, Harvey Elliott and Luiz Diaz are all further potential departures, although a Diaz exit is currently less likely despite Bayern Munich's attempts to prise him away.
Sky Sports' Adam Bate:
When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.
""These were players with similar profiles from teams that were better than our team, but not at the distance Paris Saint-Germain were from us,"" Oscar Garcia, Reims' then head coach, told Sky Sports. ""We challenged him to reach the level of the other two strikers.""
On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.
He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. ""Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.""
It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League.
""He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,"" concedes Oscar. ""They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.""

'Club of my dreams' - Mbeumo completes £71m Man Utd move,Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to &#163;71m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399344/bryan-mbeumo-joins-man-utd-brentford-forward-completes-71m-transfer-to-premier-league-rivals,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:00:00",,['Manchester United'],"Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.
After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.
Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.
The forward said: ""As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.
""My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.
""Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.""
United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.
That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.
But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.
It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.
If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.
The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.
As Sky Sports News has been reporting all summer, United have been looking at No 9s.
They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.
Sky Sports News has been told one to keep an eye on as the window develops is RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.
A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.
Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.
Sky Sports Data Editor Adam Smith:
Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.
He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.
Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.
Only Mohamed Salah collected more form points than Mbeumo last term, according to the Sky Sports Power Rankings.
Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.

Sesko and Jackson on shortlist - Man Utd's No 9 targets assessed,"Manchester United have been searching for a new No 9 this summer, with the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins among their targets. Here, Sky Sports assesses their striker shortlist...",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399693/manchester-united-transfer-news-benjamin-sesko-ollie-watkins-and-nicolas-jackson-among-striker-targets,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:00:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have been searching for a new No 9 this summer, with the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Nicolas Jackson and Ollie Watkins among their targets. Here, Sky Sports assesses their striker shortlist...
RB Leipzig striker Sesko looked destined for Arsenal earlier in the window, but the negotiations never progressed, and they are now in the final stages of a deal for Viktor Gyokeres.
There was also interest from Al Hilal, but a deal did not materialise, and there is understood to be an agreement with Leipzig that he can leave this summer if their value is met.
The Slovenia international has a release clause, which is thought to be somewhere between £68m and £86m.
United have tracked his development for a number of years and Sky Sports News has been told he is one to keep an eye on as the window develops.
New signings Joao Pedro and Liam Delap appear to be ahead of Nicolas Jackson at Chelsea, and it is understood several clubs, including Manchester United, are monitoring Jackson's situation.
He made his debut for his previous club, Villarreal, under Aston Villa boss Unai Emery, and the Spaniard is understood to have a long-term admiration for the player, but Villa are not thought to be pursuing Jackson.
AC Milan are also keen on Jackson, but talks via intermediaries have highlighted a gap in valuation. Milan also have United's Rasmus Hojlund on their list, as well as Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta.
Chelsea are not actively trying to sell any of their players. There continues to be interest in Jackson from multiple clubs, especially as strikers are in demand and short supply this summer. At the moment, Jackson is staying at Stamford Bridge, but that is not guaranteed to be the case by the time the window closes.
Watkins' future at Aston Villa has been the subject of further speculation this summer after Arsenal made an approach for him in January.
Although he is 29 and not expected to demand the same fee as a Sesko or Gyokeres, the England international's quality means he is on the list of a lot of top clubs this summer.
United have a long-standing interest in Watkins, though there has been no official club-to-club contact yet.
There is no doubt Watkins could provide a quality addition to any team, but Villa will not let him go easily - he has and continues to be an incredibly important player for them.
United made inquiries about Kolo Muani in January, along with Tottenham, before he joined Juventus on loan for the rest of the season.
The Paris Saint-Germain and France striker has been a priority for Juventus to re-sign this summer, but they are yet to strike a deal.
As negotiations with Juve drag on, there is always the opportunity for another club, but like most of the players on this list, his preference is to play for a club in the Champions League.
Osimhen was on a list of attacking options at United toward the end of last season, but they never acted on their interest, and the striker is now set to rejoin Galatasaray permanently.
The Nigeria international was on loan at the Turkish club from Napoli last season, and the two parties have reached an agreement for Osimhen.
Galatasaray are paying £64.9m (€75m) in three instalments in a deal which includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause for Napoli.
They have also negotiated a clause that means Galatasaray would have to pay a penalty to Napoli if Osimhen is sold to another Italian club over the next two years.
Manchester United have had an interest in Gyokeres since Ruben Amorim, who worked with him at Sporting, arrived at the club.
But Arsenal are closing in on the Sweden striker, and United are not expected to make a move for him, contrary to reports in Portugal over the weekend.
Arsenal are thought to be finalising the bonus payments with Sporting, after agreeing the fixed fee of £55m over a week ago.
Arsenal are expected to pay a further £8.5m in add-ons, and negotiations have been around the conditions of those bonus payments, with the hope that Gyokeres plays some part in the club's pre-season tour.
If that deal does go through, Gyokeres will be facing his former boss Amorim on the opening weekend of the Premier League at Old Trafford on August 17 - live on Sky Sports.

Chelsea set Jackson asking price amid Man Utd interest,"Chelsea value Nicolas Jackson at between &#163;80m and &#163;100m, with Manchester United among Premier League clubs keeping an eye on him.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399749/nicolas-jackson-transfer-chelsea-set-asking-price-amid-interest-from-manchester-united,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 15:59:00",Kaveh Solhekol,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","Chelsea value Nicolas Jackson at between £80m and £100m, with Manchester United among Premier League clubs keeping an eye on him.
The 24-year-old is also subject to interest from clubs in Europe and Saudi Arabia; however, Chelsea are under no pressure to sell as he has eight years left on his contract.
If the Senegal international was to leave, the £79m Liverpool are paying for Hugo Ekitike would be used as a benchmark for any potential deal.
It is understood that Chelsea feel that Jackson has a better scoring and goal involvement record over the past two seasons in a higher standard league.
Jackson has 34 goal contributions over the last two Premier League campaigns, while Ekitike has 29 in the last season for Bundesliga side, Eintracht Frankfurt.
Jackson's Chelsea was plunged into uncertainty after he played a bit-part role in his side's Club World Cup-winning campaign.
Promising starts from new signings, Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, who both play in Jackson's position, meant his involvement in the competition wore thin as his side progressed to the final.
Any incomings at Chelsea continue to be exit-dependent. Chelsea would ideally like to start the season with three high-quality players who can play in the No 9 role.
With the additions of Delap and Pedro, if Jackson were to leave, they may sign a wide player instead of another No 9 because Pedro Neto can also play through the middle.
Xavi Simons, Alejandro Garnacho, Morgan Rogers and Kenan Yildiz are some of the players Chelsea are currently looking at.

Sky Sports News has been told the issue is not football or transfer-related, and was communicated by the midfielder internally.
Sky Sports News understands the club are happy to respect his privacy, and Forest have made no public comment on the matter.
It is expected that he will join up with the squad later this week after his team-mates landed at Faro airport on Monday.
Nevertheless, it comes at a very difficult time for Gibbs-White and Forest, with relations tense following the stand-off with Tottenham over their £60m bid for him.
Up until now, the 25-year-old has continued to report for duty in line with his personal training plan, and there has been no indication he will take strike action or try to force through a move.
The stalemate continues between the two clubs over his proposed move to north London.
Forest's bosses shut down lines of communication with Spurs, accusing them of an illegal approach for the player and a breach of the confidentiality clause in his contract, which prevented any public release of the value of his buy-out clause.
Forest have made it clear in letters to both Tottenham and Gibbs-White's agent that they reserve the right to pursue legal action in the future, and while Spurs remain interested in buying him and are prepared to meet his £60m clause, they have not yet pursued the matter.

'I wore this shirt growing up' - Man Utd sign Mbeumo,"Bryan Mbeumo says he has joined ""the club of his dreams"" after the winger completes his move from Brentford to Manchester United for an initial £65m.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c77vp1x32g5o,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 20:07:16",Tom Mallows,['Manchester United'],"Bryan Mbeumo says he has joined ""the club of his dreams"" after completing his move from Brentford for an initial £65m.
The 25-year-old has signed a five-year contract, with the option of a further 12 months.
He is manager Ruben Amorim's third signing of the summer after the arrivals of forward Matheus Cunha and left-back Diego Leon.
Mbeumo's move, seven weeks after United's first bid for the Cameroon international, brings to an end one of the longest-running sagas of the summer.
United's third offer, worth an initial £65m with £6m in add-ons, was accepted last week.
""As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up,"" said Mbeumo.
""My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.
""Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.""
United submitted their first bid for Mbeumo - worth an overall £55m - at the start of June.
They failed with a second bid of £62.5m at the end of that month before reaching an agreement with their third offer.
Mbeumo scored 70 goals and registered 51 assists in 242 games for Brentford since joining in 2019 from Troyes.
He netted 20 goals and registered seven assists in the Premier League last season - both career highs.
""Bryan's goals and assists record in the Premier League is exceptional, his remarkable consistency has put him among the most productive players in England for the last three seasons,"" said United director of football Jason Wilcox.
""Bryan's belief in our project and determination to join the club confirmed he was the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture we are developing.""
Mbeumo's departure makes him the Bees' biggest ever sale, eclipsing the £40m paid by Al-Ahli for Ivan Toney in August 2024.
""On behalf of everyone at Brentford, I would like to wish Bryan all the best for the future and thank him for his fantastic efforts over six seasons with us,"" said Bees director of football Phil Giles.
""Bryan came to us as a teenager, and it has been an absolute pleasure for all of us here to watch him develop as a player and a person. Our fans have loved him, and he has been a part of some of our greatest days.
""There is always a right time for a player to move on and, for Bryan, that time is now. He has the opportunity to go to one of the biggest clubs in the world and we are very happy for him.""
The winger, who will wear the number 19 shirt, is expected to be in United's travelling squad for their pre-season tour of the United States on Tuesday.
A player hitting his peak?
Mbeumo recorded career-best figures in the Premier League last season for virtually every attacking metric, including goals and assists, chances created and touches in the opposition box.
With a shot conversion rate of 23.53%, only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah and Newcastle United's Alexander Isak were more clinical in front of goal.
His work out of possession in key areas should also be noted. He won the ball back 32 times in the opposition third, ranking him third out of all Premier League players.
But perhaps Mbeumo's unique selling point is his running threat with the ball at his feet. He was responsible for nine carries of more than five metres which directly ended in a goal being scored in 2024-25 - comfortably the most of any Premier League player last season.
Lengthy deal a coup for Man Utd - analysis
There were some fraught negotiations to get this deal over the line.
Manchester United felt the price Brentford wanted for Mbeumo changed on a number of occasions during discussions, which they believe were dragged out far too long. The London club would have preferred the player to join Tottenham or Newcastle because they would get a bigger fee.
Brentford feel Tottenham were in a strong bargaining position because their new manager, ex-Bees boss Thomas Frank, knew exactly what fee they wanted, which was substantially more than United were offering - initially about £45m.
At one point, with United refusing to meet Brentford's demand for an initial £70m, plus £7m in additional payments - they had seen United spend £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and felt they were in a strong position - they cheekily mentioned to Mbeumo he might wish to lower his personal demands to get to the correct figure.
It was not needed in the end and an agreement was reached that allowed all parties to move forward.
For United in particular, this is hugely important.
In this instance, they felt not only were Tottenham and Newcastle keen but believed Arsenal were interested too, and Chelsea were also flexing their muscle by the end.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of how they went about it, United got their man eventually. Considering they finished 15th last season and all the other clubs they felt they were battling with can offer Champions League football in the coming months, that does indeed represent something of a coup for technical director Jason Wilcox and his negotiating team.
There are still deals to be done of course before the window closes on 1 September, not least around the four players who continue to be exiled now Marcus Rashford's move to Barcelona has all but been confirmed.
However, for now, United can be glad at delivering Ruben Amorim's two main summer targets, reinforcing their belief the club remains an attractive proposition.

'Rashford's Man Utd exit leaves unanswered questions',"Marcus Rashford's impending Manchester United exit leaves a lot of unanswered questions, writes Simon Stone.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj4e71qq728o,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:10:13",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"In this modern world, where image means so much, the post uploaded on to Marcus Rashford's social media feed on Sunday was instructive.
Rashford was on a private plane, heading to Barcelona, playing cards with his brothers Dane and Dwaine.
As he shuffled the deck, one card was shown, half turned over. The ace of hearts.
Presumably this was deliberate. The card itself is positive, symbolic. More impactful than, say, the three of diamonds or six of clubs.
But it also captured the sentiment of genuine affection around the 27-year-old.
Even those inside Old Trafford, who have known for so long there was no chance of a return, no possibility of Ruben Amorim's arm being placed round his shoulders as he was ushered back into the fold, privately wish Rashford well and hope he makes a success of it at the Nou Camp.
They know the striker needs a spark that will return him to the levels he is capable of and that just wasn't going to happen at the club he supported as a boy and joined as a seven-year-old.
There were flashes of it during his half season on loan at Aston Villa in 2024-25 but the consistency was still missing. Rashford was looking at alternatives anyway but it is not certain Villa manager Unai Emery would have tried to sign the forward permanently, even if the Spaniard's side had qualified for the Champions League.
Barcelona is a completely different level. They are the club Rashford has had at the top of his wishlist for two seasons.
If he cannot be motivated to play alongside Robert Lewandowski or driven by the challenge of lining up with Lamine Yamal, who has emerged as a teenager on an even higher trajectory than Rashford did himself a decade ago, then major questions will be asked about his career as a whole.
Rashford move 'very good business' for Barca
Some have asked why Barca would want Rashford in the first place.
Well, stripped back, they have cut a really good deal.
Having tried, and failed, to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Bilbao in the summer, they needed to strengthen their attacking positions. Aside from a now 36-year-old Lewandowski and Yamal, who is half his age, Hansi Flick only has Brazilian Raphinha and former Manchester City forward Ferran Torres to choose from.
Barcelona knew from past discussions with Rashford's family that the player was keen to join them, as he said earlier this summer in an interview with Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz.
""Everyone wants to play with the best,"" he said. ""Hopefully... We'll see.""
This followed comments from Barca's sporting director Deco, who had said how much the club liked him, and Liverpool's Luis Diaz.
""When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team,"" he told Catalan radio station RAC1 in May.
""We like Luis, we like Rashford and we like other players,"" he said.
The structure of the deal suits Barcelona.
The club's once perilous financial position, though improved, is not perfect - it is unlikely they will be in a position to register Rashford immediately, although that will not stop him from training or playing in non-competitive games.
That would clear him to be part of this month's three-match tour of Japan and South Korea, which includes a game against K League outfit FC Seoul, who, ironically, include Rashford's former team-mate and close friend Jesse Lingard in their ranks.
Against that backdrop, a loan that contains an option, not an obligation, to buy, with the fee set at €35m (£30.3m) represents very good business.
If Rashford does well and gets close to the levels that earned him his current £325,000-a-week contract in the first place, he would be worth far more than the sum Barcelona would have to pay for someone who would then still only be 28.
If he doesn't succeed, they can just send him back to Old Trafford. There wouldn't even be the need for the penalty clause Chelsea had to pay to get out of signing Jadon Sancho this summer.
For United, there is a benefit too.
The club's hope will be that they and Amorim will be able to move on and construct their own future without repeated questions about a player who, in reality, has had one outstanding season in his last five.
Even club legends such as Rio Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs have said it is probably now time for Rashford to try something new.
'A move that brings a sense of sadness'
Rashford clearly still has a lot of friends at Old Trafford, and not just Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia, who were also told by Amorim they must train at times when the main group are not even at Carrington. Plenty of his former colleagues in the current United squad liked his post from the private plane.
But there is a delicate path to navigate.
Asked about Rashford's impending exit after the 0-0 draw with Leeds in Stockholm on 19 July, Amad Diallo dealt with the matter brilliantly.
""The only thing I can say is good luck to him but I'm more focused on United and my team,"" said the forward.
United leave for their three-match pre-season trip to the United States on Tuesday. Amorim is not due to speak to the media until Friday, two days after Rashford's planned unveiling by Barcelona.
The chances are the Portuguese manager will be asked to respond to the move and whatever Rashford has said about it but after that he should be able to deal with the more important issue of turning Manchester United into a winning team again.
Even though a parting of the ways has been inevitable for some time, there is a sense of sadness that a club which prides itself on bringing players through its youth system should have found itself in a situation where it is compliant in the exit of the 15th highest all-time scorer - 138 - and 23rd highest appearance maker.
Given his age, Rashford could comfortably have made the top 10 in both lists and deservedly been the recipient of legendary United status.
Now that accolade is in doubt from both sides.
'A relationship beyond repair'
Clearly, the player does not think he has been treated well - and that Amorim is not solely responsible for this. The feeling of those close to him is that ties at United have been severed and relationships cannot be rebuilt.
From a club perspective, that ill-fated trip to Belfast in January last year, which Rashford extended without permission, visited nightspots on two consecutive nights and was then late for training, is viewed as a lack of commitment that subsequent performances on the pitch did little to dispel.
Though Rashford scored the first goal of Amorim's reign, in his opening game at Ipswich Town in November, within a month the Portuguese reasoned the player's attitude was wrong.
Financially, it suits United for Rashford not to be on the scene given his huge salary and a strong desire to drive down the overall wage bill at the loss-making club.
But the nagging feeling persists there is more to this situation, some kind of smoking gun to explain how it all ended like this.
Certainly, Ferdinand thinks that, as he articulated on his You Tube channel.
""There must have been so much going on behind the scenes that we're just not aware of,"" the six-time Premier League winner said. ""And Marcus isn't someone who really wants to talk and do interviews, so you have to respect that. But I'm sure it'll come out in the wash at some point.
""Is it because of a lack of form? A lack of confidence? Mismanagement? Have the club failed him? Or is it down to him? Is there injuries we don't know about? Has he lost that desire? That form has gone and he can't rekindle it?
""What are the issues that have led to a young kid that's a graduate of the academy at Manchester United, which is famous for all of the great players that have come through there, [saying] he wants to leave?
""Or is it the manager saying he is going to put a marker down with one of the biggest players at the club? There are a lot of unanswered questions.""
It might be a while before we get them.

Deals for Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez mark the end of the celebrated full-back pairing of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson. But the expected arrival of Hugo Ekitike is the final flourish that makes it practically a full-scale revolution.
This is not Jurgen Klopp's team any more.
And yet, as the Bundesliga stars file in, it curiously looks as though Slot is taking Liverpool on a journey back towards his predecessor's ideas.
Before we consider how and why Ekitike will have an impact on Slot's tactics, it's worth looking at the headline numbers to show why Liverpool are prepared to spend £69m, with £10m in add-ons, on the 23-year-old.
Ekitike scored 15 goals and provided eight assists in 31 Bundesliga games last season, totalling the fifth-most goal involvements in the division. He was also involved in the fifth-most 'attacking sequences' in the Bundesliga.
That can be interpreted as showing the quality of Ekitike's all-round game, whether holding up the ball, running into channels, or bursting in behind.
In that respect – in most respects, in fact – he is very similar to Alexander Isak, albeit with considerably more flair to his game and a penchant for taking players on in the dribble.
He is particularly adept at setting up team-mates, too, creating more chances from open play (44) in 2024-25 than any other Bundesliga forward.
The only slight concern is that Ekitike is a little raw in front of goal. He took 117 shots in the Bundesliga last season, more than anyone else, but converted a disappointing 12.8%, leading to an xG under-performance of 6.6 goals – a bigger gap than any other player in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues.
But that just means Ekitike needs a little tuning up.
It's worth nothing that when Isak was the same age, playing for Real Sociedad in 2021-22, he scored just six goals in 32 league games, under-performed his xG by 3.8, and converted just 8.2% of his shots.
In an era when utilising attacking transitions are of increasing importance, Ekitike's smart assists, his give-and-go moves, and his line-breaking carries into the final third are all hallmarks of the elite modern number nine.
As a case in point, he topped the 2024-25 Bundesliga charts for shot-ending carries (44) and ranked fifth for attempted dribbles (126), while also scoring more goals from fast breaks (4) than anyone else in the division.
That's why Ekitike's expected arrival represents such an interesting shift for Slot.
In his debut year, Slot tamed the wilder aspects of Klopp's football to create a slower, calmer Liverpool, living up to widely held expectations of a manager who once described Pep Guardiola teams as the ""ultimate joy in football"".
But Ekitike represents a shift back the other way, perhaps reflecting a similar realisation to the one that recently struck Guardiola.
""Modern football is not positional,"" Guardiola told TNT Sports a few month ago, not long after signing a direct and transition-centric forward in Omar Marmoush, Ekitike's striker partner at the time. ""You have to ride the rhythm.""
Slot, too, appears to be making concessions to the way modern Premier League football is changing.
It's telling that Ekitike will arrive in the same summer as another Bundesliga star, Germany international Wirtz, forming a new-look attack built on piercing forward movement and an inclination to weave through the thirds as quickly as possible.
The two should combine superbly. Both are sharp one-touch passers between the lines, both love to crash the box, and both were sculpted in fast-transitioning Bundesliga teams.
That is a clear step change for Slot and, to an extent, a surprising turn back towards the 'heavy metal' days of Klopp.
Is Slot making major revisions to Liverpool's formation?
Along with Wirtz and the two new full-backs, Ekitike points to a different Liverpool set-up.
In 2024-25, some 47 of Liverpool's 86 goals (55%) were scored or assisted by Mohamed Salah, who ran the right wing almost on his own as Alexander-Arnold drifted inside.
By contrast, Frimpong is a very attacking, very wide right-back. That should take some of the pressure off Salah, but it might also see the Egyptian move infield to support the new creator-in-chief Wirtz, Liverpool's first proper number 10 in years.
Adding weight to that theory is Ekitike's history of playing in a strike partnership. He was arguably at his best in a 3-5-2 alongside Marmoush at Frankfurt, with whom he regularly swapped positions in a fluid forward line.
He was also more often than not playing in a two at Reims, where he made his name. Could Slot be planning something similar with Ekitike and Salah?
In a 4-2-3-1, Frimpong's aggressive wing play on the right could free Salah to drift inside and operate as something like a split striker alongside Ekitike, with Wirtz and a number eight sitting just behind.
That would certainly be direct, dynamic and straight-lined, and would certainly be ready for a turn towards fast-transitioning football next season.
But it's just one of the options available to Slot now he has such a versatile number nine leading the charge.
Ekitike can drop like Roberto Firmino or get in behind, can play alone or in a two, and can play transitional football or in a possession-centric side.
He is the real deal: the centre-forward of the calibre and tactical dexterity pretty much every 'Big Six' club has been looking for.
Whether Slot continues with Guardiola-like patience or swings back towards Klopp-like verticality, Liverpool's chances of retaining the Premier League title just improved.

Arsenal 'short of numbers' after £123m spend - Arteta,Mikel Arteta is not ruling out bringing more new signings on Arsenal's pre-season tour as negotiations for striker Viktor Gyokoeres continue.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0564nzmqp9o,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:44:24",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Mikel Arteta said Arsenal are ""short on numbers"" and are looking to ""improve the depth and quality"" of the squad.
The Gunners have been busy in the transfer market and have completed deals for Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard and Noni Madueke for a total of about £123.5m.
They are also still in negotiations for the 73.5m euros (£63.5m) transfer of Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres and working to bring in young defender Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia.
Arsenal had been hoping to finalise a deal for Sweden international Gyokeres and include him on their pre-season tour but a transfer has yet to be completed, although Arteta has not ruled out new signings joining them in Asia.
""I cannot comment on any player who is not part of our group yet. When we have something concrete to offer in any case to any player, we will do that,"" Arteta said when asked about the arrival of 27-year-old Gyokeres.
Asked whether there could be more new signings joining his 30-man squad while they are travelling, Arteta said: ""There's still a long time in the window and we are seeking still.
""In terms of numbers, we are short and we have to improve the depth and quality of the squad. We are constantly looking in the market.
""Until that happens, [we] focus on the players we have - and I'm very pleased with what I have seen in the last 10-15 days.""
Arsenal are in Singapore for matches against AC Milan and Newcastle before they travel to Hong Kong for a game with rivals Tottenham.
Speaking in Singapore about his new signings ahead of Arsenal's match against AC Milan on Wednesday, Arteta added: ""It's like shaking the tree again.
""New faces... they bring new excitement, new energy as well. We signed very important players as well. I think everybody feels that the heights have to go to different level and it's what we are seeking.""

Mbeumo 'proven quality' - but Man Utd still have striker dilemma,Bryan Mbeumo has joined Manchester United to boost their forward options but does Ruben Amorim still need to sign a striker?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ylzl4p227o,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:30:26",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"One of Manchester United's key priorities this summer was a search for goals.
Last season was United's worst in the Premier League era, and a key reason was the paltry 44 goals they scored - the average of 1.15 per game their lowest in a top-flight season since 1973-74.
Bryan Mbeumo's £65m move from Brentford takes their guaranteed spending on attacking talent this summer to £127.5m, following the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.
But with both players expected to play in number 10 positions, do the club need a new central striker, or will Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee benefit from added firepower around them?
Chris Sutton, who won the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers, said: ""United's attack is clearly an area they need to improve. That's why they have gone for Mbeumo, because I think he is someone they feel they can trust in all areas, in possession and out of it, with the work-rate and energy - and goals too.
""Mbeumo is absolutely not cheap, but that is the going rate for a proven Premier League player.
""They want to bring in signings who are not development players but players who have been there and done it. Mbeumo is one of those. Cunha too.
""The question is do United still need another number nine? Because Rasmus Hojlund did not score enough last season.""
The end for Hojlund? Or a new opportunity?

By common consent, when United's troublesome Premier League campaign came to an end in May, the key failing that had to be addressed was their lack of goals.
Most assumed that meant a new number nine would be signed.
That United made a big play for Liam Delap - available for £30m from Ipswich - before he signed for Chelsea indicated key figures at Old Trafford felt the same.
Yet now, more than £120m later and with two new additions more at home behind a main forward rather than as one, questions are being asked about whether they will bring in a number nine or if - despite huge reservations - they stick with Hojlund.
The reasoning for the latter would be simple.
In order to fund more expensive recruitment, they need to generate more finance and - aside from sell-on clauses for Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Carreras - they have not managed it.
So a big offer for Aston Villa's England international Ollie Watkins is unlikely and, of the players available for nothing, the injury-hit Dominic Calvert-Lewin and veteran Jamie Vardy represent significant risk.
Though many thought they overpaid at the time, the recruitment team behind then manager Erik ten Hag felt it was worth signing off a £72m fee to bring in Hojlund from Italian club Atalanta.
At the time, Ten Hag said Hojlund had ""huge potential"" but he had ""to prove it"". So far, he has not done so.
He scored just four league goals all season, with understudy Zirkzee only managing three.
It has to be said, Hojlund's goals came from chances worth a measly 5.2 expected goals, showing the lack of opportunities he was being provided with - or making for himself.
Sutton said: ""Have United been providing him with the chances and the opportunities? The answer to that is no.
""But also, you have to consider whether he has done well enough. Has he ever been a prolific goalscorer? That would be the nagging doubt and is something I have debated with United fans.
""It is not to say he doesn't have time on his side, and his attitude is good too.""
But in a summer during which Carreras joined Real Madrid - fulfilling the promise many in the club's academy felt he had before they were overruled by Ten Hag and others who believed the full-back was not quick enough to excel at the highest level - are they ready to give up on Hojlund just yet?
The 22-year-old's contract does not expire until 2028. If they sold now, United wouldn't receive close to the sum they paid for him.
There are many unanswered questions at Old Trafford as the Premier League opener against Arsenal approaches.
Whether they should sign another number nine or stick with Hojlund and hope he flourishes alongside the likes of Cunha and Mbeumo is one of the most significant.
'Mbeumo will be expected to perform straight away'
Whatever the decision on United's striker dilemma, there can be little argument the addition of Mbeumo - alongside Cunha - strengthens their firepower.
Only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, Newcastle's Alexander Isak and Manchester City's Erling Haaland scored more than his 20 Premier League goals last season.
It was, though, the first time he has reached double figures for a top-flight club, and his expected goals (xG) statistic of 12.3 - which he outperformed by 7.7 goals - is something that would be difficult to repeat.
In the past five Premier League seasons, just 14 players have overperformed their xG by five goals or more.
Sutton said: ""He has done well at Brentford but playing for Manchester United is very different. With respect to Brentford, there is no great expectation there. At United, he will be expected to perform straight away.
""He has experience, he is a good finisher and his versatility is a big positive - he can play as a central striker as well as on the wing, cutting inside off the right on to his left foot.
""But he has had one very good season where his numbers were very good, so the question is whether he can repeat that.""
The Cameroon international is not being bought just for his goals, though.
Mbeumo prefers to play on the right behind a striker - with Cunha expected to feature on the left - but also has the versatility to play centrally, offering another solution to the striker problem.
He topped the list for touches per 90 minutes for players who scored more than 15 goals last season - showing his involvement in play - and ranks as one of the best ball carriers in the league, consistently with an effective end product.
He was 17th on the list of top assisters - with seven - but in expected assists he led the way in the Premier League with 9.3 xA.
Alongside Cunha's creativity, that can only be good news for whoever is chosen to play the central striker role.
""Consistency in those forward positions is what United are striving for, because they have not had it with, say, Alejandro Garnacho or Antony,"" said Sutton.
""They are maybe thinking an older, more experienced player, who is more reliable, is what they need. That's Mbeumo - he fits into Ruben Amorim's system and he fits the bill as proven Premier League quality too.
""Amorim wants a harmonious camp as well as a consistent performer, not someone who is a 3/10 one week and a 9/10 the next.
""That's what Manchester United have really been lacking and the numbers Mbeumo provided could be really important. That is the part of the jigsaw they have got to really solve if they want to be challenging at the top end of the table.""

Manchester City’s record £1bn deal with Puma and the value beyond bottom line,The 10-year contract is worth £1bn but it has also opened the door to increase the club’s global profile with other lucrative partnerships,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/22/manchester-city-record-kit-contract-puma-football-finance,"Tue, 22 Jul 2025 07:00:48",Matt Hughes,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City had a billion reasons to celebrate the new kit deal with Puma announced last week, yet beyond the bottom line the value of the contract may prove priceless.
The Guardian has learned that the 10-year deal, worth £1bn, contains clauses giving the German sportswear manufacturer options to extend the partnership way beyond that, but most significant to City may be what Puma’s endorsement and huge financial commitment say to independent brands and the Premier League about the club’s value.
The Premier League has twice accused City of using related-party companies to artificially inflate the value of their sponsorship revenue. It blocked proposed deals with Etihad Airways and First Abu Dhabi Bank in 2023, sparking an acrimonious legal battle that remains ongoing.
In a significant victory for the club, an independent panel ruled in February that the Premier League’s associated party transaction (APT) rules in operation at that time were “void and unenforceable”. City have since launched a legal challenge against amended APT regulations voted through by 16 clubs last November. Another independent panel is expected to rule on that matter later this year, with City reserving the right to sue the Premier League, depending on the outcome.
The kit deal with Puma could prove an extremely useful weapon in City’s armoury, as well as opening the door to other lucrative contracts, which has not gone unnoticed at other clubs.
“This is a huge deal for City, in terms of what it says about the size of the club and their ability to attract independent sponsors,” a senior executive at another club told the Guardian. “City have submitted two legal challenges to the Premier League’s APT rules after having two sponsorship deals blocked. But maybe those deals weren’t overvalued after all?”
The reported value of the Puma deal has attracted some scepticism because, at £100m a year, it is a huge rise on City’s existing £65m-a-year Puma contract. The increase does not reflect City’s recent merchandising sales which, according to figures collated by Uefa, brought in £69m last year, just over half the revenue generated by Manchester United and Liverpool, and far behind the world leaders, Real Madrid, whose merchandising income was £170m.
City’s ability to generate more than the £90m and £60m annual payments United and Liverpool will receive from Adidas next season has been widely questioned given their north-west rivals have larger global fanbases, but independent experts are adamant that Puma would not overpay.
“Puma’s strategy is based upon having a smaller number of iconic clubs so Manchester City fits this profile,” Ricardo Fort, a former head of sponsorship at Coca-Cola and Visa who now runs his own consultancy firm, told the Guardian. “They also have kit deals with other clubs in the City Football Group, including Palermo and Melbourne, but City will be their priority.
“Puma are very disciplined about what they will pay for sponsorship deals so will not have overpaid, or at least not by more than they had to. They are very rigorous.”
Puma’s relationship with City goes back to 2019, when they signed a group-wide deal that also covered Melbourne City, Girona FC, Club Atlético Torque and Sichuan Jiuniu FC. Despite this Puma had to beat off rival offers from Adidas and Nike to agree an extension, which may also go some way towards explaining its value.
City’s income and global profile have also increased significantly since 2019 on the back of the extraordinary achievements of Pep Guardiola’s side, who have won 14 major trophies, including four Premier League titles in a row, and in 2023 became the second English team to claim the treble.
In their annual report published last December, City announced a Premier League record revenue of £715m for the 2023-24 season, with commercial income accounting for £344.7m. Over the past five years City’s revenue has grown by 50%, an increase which broadly tallies with the value of the Puma contract.
For branding expert Marcel Knobil of BrandGuru, the partnership makes sense. “Brands want to be associated with success and Manchester City can boast a record that no other club has achieved,” he said.
“The club also has an extremely wealthy owner behind it, which will also provide some future-assurance for Puma. Kit sponsors want teams to be both successful and packed with stars – and only deep pockets can secure the latter.”
Puma’s renewed commitment is also a confidence boost for City while they await the verdict of the Premier League’s 130-plus charges related to alleged breaches of financial fair play rules. Numerous industry sources told the Guardian that the contract would almost certainly include so-called “bad faith clauses” enabling Puma to terminate if the club are found guilty of serious wrongdoing.
City declined to comment. The club have denied the charges, so do not consider early termination to be a possibility.

‘Club of my dreams’: Bryan Mbeumo seals £71m Manchester United move,Says United are ‘the team whose shirt I wore growing up’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/21/club-of-my-dreams-bryan-mbeumo-seals-71m-manchester-united-move,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:07:30",Will Unwin,['Manchester United'],"Bryan Mbeumo said he had joined “the club of my dreams” after completing a £71m move to Manchester United, where the Cameroon international has signed a five-year deal, from Brentford.
The 25-year-old was intent on moving to Old Trafford after learning of United’s interest at the start of the summer. United made a number of bids for the forward, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, and eventually struck a deal worth an initial £65m with a further £6m in add-ons.
“As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up,” Mbeumo said. “My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.
“Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.”
Mbeumo joins a team that finished 15th in the Premier League last season and is without European football. He is part of Amorim’s rebuild and was a key target for the head coach, who pinpointed Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha as important signings. He will get his first chance to play alongside his new teammates as they embark on a tour of the US in the coming days.
“Bryan’s goals and assists record in the Premier League is exceptional, his remarkable consistency has put him among the most productive players in England for the last three seasons,” United director of football, Jason Wilcox, said. “Bryan’s belief in our project and determination to join the club confirmed that he was the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing.”
It is anticipated that United forward Marcus Rashford will complete a loan move to Barcelona on Wednesday. The England international travelled to Catalonia on Sunday and underwent a medical on Monday. The La Liga champions have agreed to cover his wages this season and there is an option to sign him permanently for €35m next summer.

"Liverpool agree £79m deal for Hugo Ekitiké, taking summer spend to almost £300m",Eintracht Frankfurt to get guaranteed £69m for striker,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/21/liverpool-agree-hugo-ekitike-deal-79m-eintracht-frankfurt,"Mon, 21 Jul 2025 10:54:24",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool are to take their summer spending to almost £300m after agreeing to pay £69m plus £10m in add-ons for the Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitiké.
Ekitiké emerged as the Premier League champions’ favoured No 9 after they received no encouragement regarding their interest in the Newcastle forward Alexander Isak.
Liverpool accelerated talks with Eintracht late last week, having been granted permission to discuss personal terms with the player. The £10m in add-ons for the France Under‑21 international relate to individual and club achievements. The deal amounts to €91m, €9m less than the €100m release clause in the forward’s contract.
Ekitiké is poised to become the champions’ seventh signing of an ambitious summer transfer window, after Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Armin Pecsi and Freddie Woodman.
The 23-year-old Frenchman has agreed in principle a six-year contract and is expected to join Arne Slot’s squad this week on their 10‑day pre‑season tour of Hong Kong and Japan. Liverpool arrived on Monday in Hong Kong in advance of their friendly against Milan on Saturday.
Ekitiké is scheduled to undergo a medical in the UK on Tuesday before finalising his contract and flying to Hong Kong. Liverpool’s sporting director, Richard Hughes, and members of their medical staff remained in the UK to complete the transfer.
Ekitiké scored 22 goals and made 12 assists in all competitions last season, his first in the Bundesliga, as Eintracht qualified for the Champions League. He emerged as a leading transfer target this summer for Newcastle, who had a £70m bid rejected last week, but made it clear his preference was to join Slot’s side.

The Guardian understands the 31-year-old forward will have a medical with the Michelle Kang-owned side on Tuesday. Parris joined Brighton from Manchester United on deadline day last summer, and has scored seven goals in 22 games for the side.
The forward will join six new recruits already announced by London City: Danielle van de Donk from Lyon, Sanni Franssi and Elene Lete from Real Sociedad, Isa Kardinaal from Ajax, Teyah Goldie from Arsenal (who spent last season on loan with London City), and Poppy Pattinson also from Brighton.
Parris, a European champion with England in 2022, was omitted from Sarina Wiegman’s Euro 2025 squad, which she told Sky Sports was “very disappointing” to begin with. “It’s always hard to get that sort of news,” Parris said.
“The biggest thing for me is that I gave it everything. The one thing people will ask is whether you have any regrets or anything you wish you would have done, and I don’t. Because of that, in my mind I’m like: you gave it your all. There’s nothing I can sit here and say I should have done or could have done.”
Parris, who has scored 17 goals in 74 games for England, spent two seasons at Manchester United before joining Brighton and has had spells at Arsenal, Lyon, Manchester City and Everton. She has won the league in both France and England, as well as three FA Cups, a Coupe de France and a Champions League, won with Lyon.

Ndoye, a Switzerland international, is regarded by Forest as a replacement for Anthony Elanga, who joined Newcastle for £55m. Forest were interested in signing Johan Bakayoko but he elected to leave PSV for RB Leipzig. Ndoye, who scored eight goals in 30 Serie A games last season, has interest from Napoli but is keen on testing himself in the Premier League.
Ndoye, who has 22 international caps, began his career with Lausanne before moving to Nice. After struggling there he returned to Lausanne on loan, then joined Basel permanently. He rebuilt his reputation in Switzerland, earning a move to Bologna in 2023, and helped them to qualify for the Champions League, in which he made eight appearances last season.
Forest have inquired about McAtee but are unlikely to meet the City’s valuation for a player who won the European Under-21 Championship last month. Earlier in the summer interested parties were told McAtee was available for about £25m but this has been re-evaluated and City are looking for closer to the £42.5m Chelsea spent on Cole Palmer.
McAtee has interest from West Ham, Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, and the 22-year-old has visited Germany to view the two Bundesliga clubs’ facilities as he considers his next move. The attacking midfielder made 27 appearances for City last season but has never been a regular under Pep Guardiola.
