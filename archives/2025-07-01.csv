Klopp: Club World Cup is worst idea ever implemented in football,"Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has labelled the expanded Club World Cup the ""worst idea ever implemented in football"" due to its impact on player workload and recovery time.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13389829/jurgen-klopp-says-club-world-cup-is-worst-idea-ever-implemented-in-football-due-to-workload-concerns,"Sat, 28 Jun 2025 17:02:00",,['Liverpool'],"Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has labelled the expanded Club World Cup the ""worst idea ever implemented in football"" due to its impact on player workload and recovery time.
Klopp, a long-term critic of the ever-expanding football calendar who is now working as head of global soccer for Red Bull, feels the timing and duration of the tournament in its new format heighten the risk of burnout and injuries for players.
""In the end, it's all about the game and not the surrounding aspects - and that's why the Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard,"" he told Welt in Germany.
""People who have never had anything to do with day-to-day business or who no longer have anything to do with it come up with something.""
He added: ""Last year we had the Copa America and European Championship, this year the Club World Cup and next year then the World Cup.
""This means no real recovery for the players who are there, neither physically nor mentally.
""An NBA player, who also earns a big salary, has a four-month break every year. This is what (Liverpool defender) Virgil van Dijk got in his entire career.""
This year's Club World Cup, which is taking place in the United States, began on June 14, three weeks after the end of the Premier League season, and concludes on July 13, four weeks before the start of the new top-flight campaign.
The competition features representatives from across the world, including Manchester City and Chelsea this year, and is due to be held every four years.
Before the start of this year's tournament, FIFPro, the representative organisation of global player unions, recommended a mandatory four-week off-season break for players to ease calendar congestion and protect player welfare.
Analysis by Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:
Jurgen Klopp does have a very valid point, a point a lot of people in football agree with.
But there is another side to the story, and that is that this Club World Cup has not been set up for the benefit of Jurgen Klopp or the big European clubs; it has been set up for the benefit of clubs from all around the world.
If you speak to people from those clubs, they love this tournament, because they don't like their best players having to leave for Europe to play in the Champions League.
They have been asking FIFA to set up a competition which is the equivalent of the Champions League but for clubs all around the world and that is what they have done.
If it wasn't for the Club World Cup, a lot of these big European clubs would be going on big pre-season tours anyway. How many times have we seen Liverpool flying off to the US or the Far East?
That is what clubs do. Football seems to have turned into a 365-day-a-year sport. Jurgen Klopp is unhappy about it but I don't see what can be done about the fact that we are where we are.
Also, don't forget, these modern European sides have big, big squads. Manchester City have brought around 35 players and they seem to be enjoying it. I think it's been a very useful activity for them because they've been able to bed in new signings and new coaches.
At the end of the day, whoever wins this can make around £100m and that is a massive deal for clubs in the era of PSR and FFP.
Finally, I would say to Jurgen Klopp, is it really the worst idea ever implemented in football? Is it worse than Liverpool being one of the clubs who tried to set up a European Super League? Is it worse than VAR, for instance? I'm not so sure.
Yes of course, Jurgen Klopp has a point. But my personal opinion is that football doesn't belong to the big clubs in Western Europe. It belongs to the whole world. And the rest of the world is enjoying this tournament much more than Jurgen Klopp.

Chelsea agree deal to sign Dortmund's Gittens,Chelsea have agreed a deal with Borussia Dortmund to sign Jamie Gittens.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13389505/jamie-gittens-transfer-news-chelsea-agree-deal-with-borussia-dortmund-to-sign-forward,"Sat, 28 Jun 2025 19:00:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have agreed a deal with Borussia Dortmund to sign Jamie Gittens.
Talks had been progressing in the US, where both teams are taking part in the Club World Cup and despite Bayern Munich also being interested, a deal has now been agreed for the 20-year-old to move to Stamford Bridge on a long-term deal.
Earlier this month, Dortmund turned down an offer worth £42m, and the two clubs were unable to agree a deal before the first window closed on 10 June.
An eventual agreement between the two sides comes amid the west London club's search to strengthen wide areas following the decision not to take up the option to sign Jadon Sancho permanently.
The England U21 international contributed 12 goals and five assists in 48 games in all competitions for Dortmund last season.
Gittens has previously been affiliated with the Stamford Bridge outfit, having been on Chelsea's books as a youth player before making the switch to Manchester City.
He moved to Germany in 2020, following in the footsteps of Jadon Sancho, and broke into the Dortmund team in 2022.
Gittens has also made 11 appearances for England Under-21s, but was not included in Lee Carsley's squad for the European Championships.
Gittens' return to English football will see him competing for a place in Enzo Maresca's side with the likes of Pedro Neto and Noni Madueke, who currently occupy the wide positions.
With Chelsea agreeing a deal to sign Gittens, the 20-year-old winger looks set to become a Premier League player, but his route there has been a little different.
In conversation with coaches and team-mates, we analyse the reasons for his rise and what could come next for him at Stamford Bridge.
Sky Sports explores his his early promise at Reading, his development at Dortmund and how he fits in at Chelsea.

Pogba signs for Monaco,Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has signed for Ligue 1 side AS Monaco on a two-year deal.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13389518/paul-pogba-former-man-utd-midfielder-signs-for-monaco-following-drug-ban,"Sat, 28 Jun 2025 17:25:00",,['Manchester United'],"Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has signed for Ligue 1 side AS Monaco on a two-year deal.
The 2018 World Cup winner's move to France marks Pogba's return to football after seven months without a club. The midfielder was a free agent after agreeing to the mutual termination of his Juventus contract in November last year.
In a statement on their website, the Ligue 1 club announced: ""AS Monaco are delighted to announce the arrival of Paul Pogba. The French World Champion has signed a 2-season deal, and is now tied to the Principality until 30 June 2027.""
Juventus decided to part ways with Pogba after an initial four-year ban in February 2024 for a doping offence was reduced to 18 months.
The 32-year-old was free to return to football in March as the 18-month period began at the point of his provisional ban, which was issued in September 2023. However, Pogba has not made a professional appearance since, with his last coming as a substitute in a 2-0 victory for Juventus over Empoli.
The midfielder left Old Trafford in 2022 on a free transfer to return to Juventus and went on to make 12 appearances during his second spell in Turin.
Pogba will link up with former Tottenham and Bayern Munich defender Eric Dier, who also joined the Ligue 1 club on a free transfer this summer.
Monaco finished third in Ligue 1 last season, behind champions Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille, and will be hoping the arrival of the World Cup winner can help bridge the gap towards the top of the table.

Brentford reject second Man Utd bid for Mbeumo - but talks ongoing,"Manchester United's second bid for Bryan Mbeumo, worth &#163;62.5m, has been rejected by Brentford.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13389543/bryan-mbeumo-transfer-manchester-uniteds-improved-62-5m-bid-rejected-by-brentford,"Fri, 27 Jun 2025 19:56:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United's second bid for Bryan Mbeumo, worth £62.5m, has been rejected by Brentford.
The improved offer from United is the same figure they paid for Wolves' Matheus Cunha.
United had already seen a bid worth £55m rejected. Talks between the two sides are continuing with Mbeumo wanting to join the Old Trafford club.
Sky Sports News revealed earlier this month that Spurs have also held initial talks with Brentford for the 25-year-old.
Mbeumo is understood to be intrigued by Spurs, who have just appointed his former boss Thomas Frank, but one source has told Sky Sports News that he is leaning towards United.
Mbeumo is a player United have admired for a while, and he is seen as a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system.
There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.
Sky Sports Data Editor Adam Smith:
Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.
He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign, primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.
Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace, clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.
Only Mohamed Salah collected more form points than Mbeumo last term, according to the Sky Sports Power Rankings.
Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points, equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.

From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Brighton reject two bids for Brazil forward Pedro,"Brighton reject two bids by Premier League clubs for Brazil forward Joao Pedro, thought to be Chelsea and Newcastle.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2ez3k4d02xo,"Sat, 28 Jun 2025 17:00:00",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Brighton have rejected two bids by Premier League clubs for forward Joao Pedro.
The clubs have not been revealed, but Chelsea and Newcastle are currently targeting the Brazil striker.
Liverpool are also known to admire the 23-year-old, though are not pursuing a move at the moment.
The bids are reportedly about £50m, as Brighton hold out for at least £60m for Pedro, who was signed from Watford for a then club record £30m in 2023.
Pedro, who has three caps, is known to be keen to move away from the south coast, while Chelsea and Newcastle are able to offer him Champions League football.
Chelsea are targeting two forwards this summer with Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens in ongoing talks with the club.
The Blues see Pedro as a replacement for versatile forward Christopher Nkunku, who is expected to leave Stamford Bridge despite his current involvement in the Club World Cup.
Pedro scored 10 goals and six assists in 27 Premier League games for Brighton last season, but was excluded from the squad by manager Fabian Hurzeler for disciplinary reasons on the last day of the season.

Chelsea agree Jamie Gittens deal and battle Newcastle for João Pedro,Borussia Dortmund winger to sign seven-year contract,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/28/sunderland-agree-club-record-30m-deal-for-strasbourg-midfielder-habib-diarra,"Sat, 28 Jun 2025 18:44:16",Jacob Steinberg,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","Chelsea have agreed a deal worth about £55m to sign the Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens and are competing with Newcastle for the Brighton forward João Pedro.
Enzo Maresca is looking for attacking additions this summer and has been keen to bring in a right-footed left-winger after sending Jadon Sancho back to Manchester United. Mykhailo Mudryk is also unavailable after being charged by the Football Association with doping offences.
Chelsea identified Gittens as a key target in January and have been negotiating with Dortmund over the 20-year-old this summer. A fee has been agreed and the England Under-21 international, who also had interest from Bayern Munich, has already said yes to a seven-year contract.
Gittens, who is due to undergo a medical, will be unable to feature for Chelsea at the Club World Cup as he has already played for Dortmund in the United States.
Chelsea are also looking to sign a versatile forward and have muscled in on Newcastle’s attempt to sign the Brighton forward João Pedro. The Brazil international is a key target for Newcastle, who have already had a £50m bid for him rejected.
However, Chelsea are also interested in the former Watford attacker and believe they can convince him to join them after opening talks with Brighton over a deal. Sam Jewell, who brought João Pedro to Brighton and has since joined Chelsea’s recruitment team, has been influential in the push for him.
Brighton are holding out for £60m for João Pedro, who has scored 30 goals in 70 appearances for the club. There is hope from Chelsea and Newcastle that a lower fee can be agreed. Chelsea have had an initial approach knocked back but negotiations are ongoing and there is a feeling that the 23-year-old will favour a move to Stamford Bridge over Newcastle.
João Pedro’s appeal to Chelsea is partly down to his versatility and Premier League experience. Chelsea want an attacker to provide variety and depth in creative positions. They have also considered West Ham’s Mohammed Kudus. It is expected that space will be found for João Pedro in Maresca’s squad by selling João Félix and Christopher Nkunku.
Elsewhere, Sunderland are set to beat Leeds and a host of European clubs to the signing of Habib Diarra from Strasbourg for a club-record £30m as they prepare to return to the Premier League.
The Senegal midfielder, who scored in the 3-1 defeat of England at the City Ground this month, is expected on Wearside to complete his medical after Sunderland had an offer worth an initial €31.5m (£27m) plus €4m in add-ons accepted.
Leeds had also been hoping to sign Diarra and saw a £24m bid rejected last week, while Milan and Eintracht Frankfurt were among the 21-year-old’s other suitors.
But with Sunderland having identified Diarra as their preferred option to replace Jobe Bellingham, who joined Borussia Dortmund for an initial £27.8m, their improved bid was enough to convince Strasbourg to accept their offer.
It represents something of a coup for the Championship playoff winners as they prepare to return to the Premier League after an eight-year absence, having already signed Enzo Le Fée from Roma after he spent the second half of last season on loan in the north-east. Their Wembley hero Tom Watson has already departed to Brighton for £10m, while they have also explored re-signing Jordan Henderson from Ajax.
The fee for Diarra, who represented France at under-21 level before making his senior debut Senegal last year, surpasses the £20m they paid for Le Fée. Sunderland are also thought to be interested in the Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka, who had stints at Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as Sassuolo’s French winger Armand Laurienté.
Paul Pogba has joined Monaco on a free transfer after signing a two-year contract, the Ligue 1 club said on Saturday, as the 32-year-old French midfielder looks to revive his career following a doping ban.

Enzo Maresca intent on resisting interest in Chelsea defender Josh Acheampong,Clubs in England and Europe are tracking the 19-year-old,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/28/chelsea-enzo-maresca-josh-acheampong-club-world-cup,"Sat, 28 Jun 2025 02:30:42",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"Enzo Maresca has said that Chelsea have no intention of selling Josh Acheampong this summer. Several clubs in England and Europe are tracking the 19-year-old defender but it is understood that there is no plan for him to leave Stamford Bridge at the moment.
Sources close to Acheampong have privately said that suggestions that the youngster is frustrated at Chelsea are incorrect. Acheampong, who started at right-back in Chelsea’s win over Esperance in the Club World Cup last Tuesday, signed a new five-year contract last year and enjoyed a breakthrough campaign under Maresca last season.
The academy product will only go on loan if he agrees with the club that it is best for his development but the long-term plan remains for him to thrive at Chelsea.
“The clubs that you mentioned, they like Josh, but we also like Josh,” Maresca said. “Any club likes good players. My plan with Josh is quite clear. I said many times that I really like Josh.
“I think he potentially can be a top defender for this club. It’s on him to have the right timing to do the things. We are full of young players here, full of talented players, even defenders. So I think the best plan for Josh is to be with us and I’m very happy if he’s going to be with us.”
Chelsea face Benfica in the last 16 in Charlotte on Saturday afternoon. It will be the first time that Enzo Fernandez faces Benfica since leaving them for £106.7m two years ago. Fernandez has the most goal involvements (14) of any Chelsea player in 2025.
“I am very pleased with Enzo,” Maresca said. “Firstly because he’s a nice boy, he’s polite. And then because with us, since we started, he’s working very well in all the aspects, inside the pitch, outside the pitch.
“We said already many times that with us this season’s struggle will be at the beginning to understand the way we want to play. But then he’s doing fantastic in terms of numbers, goals, assist.
“This is what we want from our attacking players. I said many times that I prefer to have the attacking players score 10 to 12 goals each than just a striker with 40 goals. His contribution this season has been top, and for sure next season will be even better.”
