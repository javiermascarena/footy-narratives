Arsenal complete cut-price deal to sign Kepa from Chelsea,Arsenal have completed a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga after triggering the &#163;5m release clause in his contract.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13381253/kepa-arrizabalaga-transfer-news-arsenal-complete-5m-deal-to-sign-chelsea-goalkeeper,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:00:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Arsenal have completed a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga after triggering the £5m release clause in his contract.
Kepa, who spent last season on loan at Bournemouth, has signed a three-year deal at the Emirates and will bring experienced cover for international team-mate David Raya.
Arsenal are understood to have been impressed by Kepa's desire to join the club and fight for his place in the team.
The Gunners met a release clause in the 30-year-old's deal at Chelsea to secure their first incoming of the summer. Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard are expected to follow him through the door.
Kepa will replace Neto as Arsenal's back-up option in goal after the Bournemouth shot-stopper returned to his parent club following his season-long loan at the Emirates.
After signing his contract, Kepa said: ""I'm really happy to be here, really excited and looking forward to what is coming.""The ambition that is shown in this club, when I talk with Mikel [Arteta] and Inaki [Cana, goalkeeping coach], how much they show me their desire to win… I think we are so close to winning and hopefully altogether we can achieve it.""
Chelsea broke the world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper when they signed Kepa from Athletic Club for around £71m in 2018.
Kepa agreed a new contract at Chelsea last summer to allow him to go to Bournemouth on loan last season. The same deal saw him take a pay cut but also included the £5m release clause.
Kepa spent the 2023/2024 season on loan at Real Madrid.
The 30-year-old was Bournemouth's first-choice 'keeper last season, making 35 starts as Andoni Iraola's team produced their best-ever Premier League finish.
Andrea Berta, Arsenal sporting director, said: ""We are really excited to have Kepa join our Arsenal family. He is a player with great experience, someone who has already won major trophies, and we cannot wait for him to join the group and help the club win.""Kepa knows it is an exciting time to be at Arsenal and we know he is a player who will bring with him a winning mentality. We welcome him and his family to the club, and look forward to him meeting the players and staff, with everyone excited to see him.""
Arteta added: ""We are really happy to have Kepa joining us. He is a player we know, having come up against him many times in recent seasons. He brings a wealth of experience, which his team-mates will benefit from, and he has a real hunger to win.""Kepa works hard and will elevate our levels. I know he will fit in perfectly, already knowing some of his team-mates, and we are really excited about his future with us.""
Valencia wanted Arsenal target Cristhian Mosquera to stay and sign a new deal until the interest in the defender emerged from the Gunners.
The LaLiga side are now open to selling the 21-year-old as long as he joins a Champions League club.
Valencia are understood to value the centre-back in the region of £25m (€30m).
Sky Sports News reported last week the Gunners had opened talks over Mosquera.
Sky in Germany reported he had also been of interest to RB Leipzig but was ultimately deemed too expensive for them.
Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

What now for Man City after Club World Cup exit?,"Manchester City are heading home from the Club World Cup after a shock defeat by Saudi side Al-Hilal, so what now for Pep Guardiola's side?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cew00782yw2o,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:43:42",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City are heading home from the Club World Cup after a shock defeat by Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the last 16 in the United States.
The squad are scheduled to fly back to Manchester on Tuesday night, bringing to an abrupt end a tournament which promised so much but instead delivered a stunning upset.
""We have been on an incredible journey together and were in a good place. The vibe was really good,"" manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport.
""But we go home and now it is time to rest - rest our minds for the new season.""
Was it a worthwhile experience for Guardiola's squad or an unwanted extension to an already long season? And what happens next for City?
What did Guardiola learn from trip?
The sunny climes of City's Florida base appeared to refresh and rejuvenate a side that was so disappointing this season - but on Monday night their Club World Cup hopes fell apart.
The new signings all played a significant part in the tournament and it was evident that Dutchman Tijjani Reijnders will bring much-needed energy and enthusiasm to the midfield.
France international Rayan Cherki got off the mark in the group stages and provided a glorious assist for Phil Foden's extra-time goal against Al-Hilal, but there are major concerns at the other end of the pitch.
While Algerian full-back Rayan Ait-Nouri's attacking ability is undoubted, there are question marks over his defensive capabilities, having been caught out on occasion against the Saudi side.
Matheus Nunes is a midfielder playing at right-back and though City managed to paper over it during the group stages, the square peg in a round hole was glaringly obvious once up against decent opposition.
Sources had not ruled out the signing of a new right-back before the tournament and it remains to be seen whether the club make a move for one.
Guardiola also needs to address the lack of pace in the heart of the defence, with the two central defenders looking particularly sluggish when attempting to chase back the speedy Al-Hilal forwards.
The Spanish boss has made it clear he needs to trim his squad heading into the new season and there may be question marks over the future of England international John Stones, who was the only outfield player not to see any minutes on the trip.
Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether midfielder Rodri, who missed most of the season through injury, has suffered a setback.
Guardiola said he ""complained about his situation"" having come on as a second-half substitute before being taken off in extra-time.
How much did City make?
The Club World Cup has been a lucrative outing for all those involved, that is despite City missing out on extra prize money with their last-16 exit.
City earned the most in the group stage because they were the only side to win all three matches, and will depart the US having banked approximately £37.8m.
That includes almost £1.5m per win and a participation fee, believed to be £27.9m, which Fifa bases on ""sporting and commercial criteria"".
If Guardiola's team had reached the quarter-finals they would have earned an additional £9.5m in prize money, with that total rising to an extra £53.8m had they gone on to lift the trophy.
City paid £31m for Wolves left-back Ait-Nouri, who assisted a goal in their 5-2 win over Juventus, and £30.5m for Lyon forward Cherki, who scored in the 6-0 win over Al Ain, so have already paid off one of those transfers.
Chelsea are now the only remaining Premier League club in the competition. They surpassed £40m in prize money following their win against Benfica in the last 16.
Time for a rest?
If there's any solace for Manchester City, it is that the squad now has a chance to recharge before the new season.
The 61 games played by City since August equals their most in a season since Guardiola became manager in 2016.
Only three top-flight clubs in Europe have played more often over the past 11 months, albeit Chelsea will also overtake City this weekend.
Chelsea had the luxury of fielding vastly different line-ups in the 2024-25 Conference League compared to domestically.
Manchester City, with a smaller squad, have four of the 15 outfield players currently with Premier League clubs to have played more than 100 games over the past two seasons.
They are new signing Tijjani Reijnders (107), Ilkay Gundogan (105), Phil Foden (102) and Bernardo Silva (101).
In addition, that quartet were regular starters for their country at Euro 2024 and, with the exception of former Germany midfielder Gundogan, continue to play international football.
Meanwhile, only two outfield players in Europe's major leagues can top the 4,861 minutes racked up by City's recent signing Reijnders for AC Milan last season, while Josko Gvardiol, Bernardo Silva and Erling Haaland all rank in the top 13 among Premier League players.
Defeat by Al-Hilal brought to an end a season which began 325 days ago with the Community Shield against Manchester United on 10 August.
City lost 17 games in all competitions, which is at least five more than in any other season since Guardiola's appointment and the club's highest total since 2008-09.
While City scored 130 goals in 61 fixtures, the defensive lapses exposed in their Club World Cup exit have become increasingly common.
They conceded 78 times this term, comfortably their worst record under Guardiola. That is 32 more than they shipped in the Treble-winning campaign of 2022-23, when they played the same number of matches.
When will City start pre-season?
City players will head off on holiday for about four weeks before reporting back to the club for the start of pre-season.
Having spent three weeks in the USA, it remains to be seen what plans are put in place for friendly matches before the new campaign.
Will they keep it light by playing domestic opposition at City Football Academy? Could they head off to somewhere in Europe for a short trip?
One thing is for sure, City will return to Premier League action at Wolves on Saturday, 16 August (17:30 BST).

Arsenal sign goalkeeper Kepa from Chelsea for £5m,Arsenal complete the £5m signing of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce377ek2nn3o,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 14:27:10",,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Arsenal have completed the £5m signing of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea.
Spain international Kepa joins the Gunners on a three-year deal after spending last season on loan at Bournemouth, where he made 35 appearances.
""I'm really, really happy to be here, really excited and looking forward to what is coming,"" he said.
""The ambition that is shown in this club, when I talk with Mikel [Arteta] and Inaki [Cana], how much they show me their desire to win... I think we are so close to winning and, hopefully, altogether, we can achieve it.""
The 30-year-old is still the world's most expensive goalkeeper, having moved to the Blues in 2018 from boyhood club Athletic Bilbao for £71m.
His arrival at Emirates Stadium will provide competition for compatriot David Raya.
Neto was on loan at Arsenal from the Cherries during the 2024-25 campaign but they elected not to sign the Brazilian on a permanent basis.
Kepa played 163 times for Chelsea and was in the squads that lifted the Champions League, Europa League and Club World Cup.
He also spent a year on loan at Real Madrid and helped them win La Liga and the Champions League during the 2023-24 season.
Victim of his price tag at Chelsea - analysis
Kepa was a victim of his £71m price tag at Chelsea.
He was deemed the best possible option when Thibaut Courtois forced his exit from the Blues in 2018 and Alisson turned down Chelsea to join Liverpool.
Athletic Club then forced the Blues to pay Kepa's full release clause.
After his wobble early in his Chelsea career, Kepa quickly proved he was not worth either the fee nor his previous £190,000-a-week wages.
However, he was still highly respected behind the scenes. He was rated as a top professional, a good squad member and a positive character - despite his strange episode in refusing to be substituted in the Carabao Cup final in 2019.
Kepa has always been a good player but was never seen to be one who would command a world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper.

Al-Hilal 'climb Everest' - but 'worrying signs' for Man City,"Saudi Arabia have spent billions in bidding to become a world football force - and in beating Manchester City at the Club World Cup, ""climbed Mount Everest without oxygen"" according to their manager.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gddvdg7p3o,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 06:43:25",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Saudi Arabia have spent billions to try become a force in world football. On Monday night in Florida, celebrating supporters felt as if a small chunk of that had been repaid.
Pro League side Al-Hilal made their mark by stunning serial Premier League winners Manchester City 4-3 in an epic Club World Cup encounter.
Monday nights are more synonymous with live wrestling shows on television in the USA - but it was football that provided the big sporting show on the box this time as Marcos Leonardo's winner sent City packing.
As former England winger Andros Townsend put it on Dazn: ""Al-Hilal have shocked the world.""
For the Brazilian striker whose goal won the match, it was an emotional evening. Afterwards, he paid tribute to his mother, who is recovering after more than two months in hospital with a serious illness.
He said: ""I have had a difficult time in the last two months. My mother spent 70 days in the ICU [intensive care unit].
""Today she is fine, thank God. When I scored those two goals, I thought of her. She was able to watch the game.""
Al-Hilal head coach Simone Inzaghi felt as if he was back on top of the world.
A month ago, Inzaghi left Inter Milan, three days after seeing his team thrashed 5-0 by Paris St-Germain in the Champions League final.
Having barely settled into to his new role, and without the services of key injured duo Salem Al Dawsari and Aleksandar Mitrovic, he now has a huge victory to celebrate.
""The key of this result are the players, the heart they put on the pitch,"" he said.
""Tonight we had to do something extraordinary because we knew how good Manchester City are. We knew we had to climb Mount Everest without oxygen and we were great.
""We played with a strong determination and we are really feeling the game. They deserved it. They fought for every ball and it gives satisfaction to the family of Al-Hilal, Saudi Arabia and the fans here with us.""
'Let's see now if they will criticise us'
The revamped Club World Cup has not received universal acclaim but an unforgettable last-16 tie will be talked about in all corners of the globe.
Al-Hilal clung on in the first half and were fortunate to only be 1-0 down thanks to goalkeeper Bono's heroics but they recovered to go ahead in the second period.
They were twice pegged back but Marcos Leonardo delivered the decisive blow and once the final whistle was blown, staff and substitutes poured on to the pitch to enjoy the moment with their players.
The joyous Al-Hilal fans, a large cluster of whom were directly behind the dugout, waved the blue flags of the club and the green and white of the country.
Exiting the Camping World Stadium, travelling supporters packed out the concourses, dancing and singing ""ole, ole ole ole"", while Saudi journalists hugged and kissed each other in the post-match news conference room.
One walked in with wide eyes and arms raised, screaming ""Mabrook"" in Arabic, translating as ""congratulations"", almost in disbelief as to what he had witnessed.
It was the first time an Asian club have defeated a side from Europe in an official Fifa tournament. European teams have won 18 of the previous 20 meetings, with two matches drawn.
A journalist from the media outlet Arryadia called the result ""one of the biggest in the history of Saudi football"" - but added that the country's shock 2-1 win over Argentina at the 2022 World Cup will ""always be top"".
A lot of money has been spent to try to grow the Saudi game's profile - more than £700m has gone on bringing players to the Pro League, while Portugal great Cristiano Ronaldo's arrival at Al-Nassr two and a half years ago was a significant signing.
Saudi Arabia will also host the 2034 World Cup - a decision that has been defended by Fifa president Gianni Infantino amid significant criticism - with the human rights campaign group Amnesty International describing it as ""reckless"".
Infantino - the man behind the new 32-team Club World Cup format - has argued that staging the World Cup in the Gulf kingdom can be a catalyst for social improvements.
Saudi Arabia has faced years of scrutiny over its human rights and environmental record. Its World Cup bid was backed by the Football Association in December after it received assurances that all fans would be welcome.
The Saudi bid for the World Cup was unopposed, as Australia - the only other potential candidate - decided not to enter the running, hinting it was futile to do so after being given less than a month by Fifa to mount a challenge.
Fifa stood by a fast-tracked process that critics argued lacked transparency. They suggested it effectively paved the way for the Saudis thanks to a decision that only bids from Asia and Oceania would be considered.
Serbia midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who joined Al-Hilal from Lazio in 2023, was asked about the disapproval players have received in leaving Europe for the riches of the Middle East.
""Let's see now if they will criticise us,"" he said. ""We showed them it's not like they are speaking about the league.
""We show against Real Madrid, Salzburg, Pachuca and tonight. I hope we will continue to show it.""
Former Chelsea defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who scored in extra time, added: ""We knew it would be difficult against one of the best in the world.
""We wanted to show our talents. We are so happy because we wanted to show Al-Hilal had the talent to be here.""
'A real worry' for Man City
The group stage had been plain sailing for City, winning all three games, but they fell at the first knockout hurdle following a haphazard defensive display.
Pep Guardiola's side were often opened up on the counter-attack and were made to pay heavily for their sloppiness at both ends of the pitch - failing to take a host of first-half chances.
""It wasn't a fluke but really worrying signs for Guardiola,"" former City goalkeeper Shay Given said on Dazn. ""They could have scored even more. It is a real worry the chances they gave up.""
The result also ends Guardiola's flawless record at the Club World Cup as manager of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City.
The Spaniard had won all 11 of his previous matches at the tournament, conceding just four goals - but that total doubled in the space of 120 thrilling minutes in Orlando.
For Guardiola, the task now is to sort out the issues they faced in Florida before the Premier League opener at Wolves on 16 August.
He said: ""It was a difficult game. We allowed them to make transitions but we created a lot. It is a pity - we have been on incredible journey together and so good place. The vibe was really good.
""We would have loved to have continued. We had a feeling that the team is doing well but we go home and now it is time to rest and rest our minds for the new season.""

"Transfer latest: Arteta hails £5m Arrizabalaga, West Ham push for Slavia defender Diouf",Nottingham Forest have bid accepted for Lyon’s Fofana,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/01/transfer-latest-arsenal-kepa-arrizabalaga-arteta-west-ham-el-hadji-malick-diouf-slavia-prague,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 14:54:17",Jacob Steinberg,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Mikel Arteta has said Arsenal will benefit from Kepa Arrizabalaga’s experience and “real hunger to win” after the world’s most expensive goalkeeper completed a £5m transfer from Chelsea.
Arrizabalaga leaves Chelsea seven years after joining for £72m from Athletic Bilbao and will compete at Arsenal with his Spanish compatriot David Raya. After falling out of favour at Stamford Bridge Arrizabalaga has spent the past two seasons on loan, at Real Madrid and then Bournemouth.
“He is a player we know, having come up against him many times in recent seasons,” Arteta told Arsenal’s website. “He brings a wealth of experience, which his teammates will benefit from, and he has a real hunger to win. Kepa works hard and will elevate our levels. I know he will fit in perfectly.”
Arrizabalaga is Arsenal’s first summer signing and is expected to be followed by the Brentford captain, Christian Nørgaard, and Martín Zubimendi, another midfielder, who is due to join from Real Sociedad for £35m. Arteta also wants a centre-forward and another attacker, with Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze among the players under consideration.
West Ham face a battle to convince Slavia Prague to sell El Hadji Malick Diouf. The left-back is a target for Graham Potter and discussions have taken place over a deal.
Slavia are reluctant to lose the Senegal international, who is comfortable as a wing-back, and want about £20m. West Ham have repeatedly made clear they are under pressure to sell before they buy. Incomings without significant sales would leave them at risk of breaching the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.
Potter wants a left-sided defender, with Emerson Palmieri likely to leave. Ollie Scarles enjoyed a breakthrough campaign last season but the 19-year-old is inexperienced and is not ready to be first choice.
West Ham are also interested in the Liverpool midfielder Tyler Morton, who starred for England Under-21s in their victorious European championship campaign.
Nottingham Forest have had a bid accepted by Lyon for the winger Malick Fofana. The player is yet to agree terms but the Premier League club are confident of completing a deal. Forest maintain an interest in Manchester City’s James McAtee and the Real Mallorca defender Pablo Maffeo.
Sunderland have completed the club-record £30m signing of the midfielder Habib Diarra from Strasbourg on a five-year contract. The 21-year-old captained the team last season and has 11 Senegal caps, scoring against England last month.
Diarra is Sunderland’s second summer arrival after Enzo Le Fée’s loan was turned into a permanent deal. The club said Diarra would take “an extended break” before joining the squad at the end of the month.

Maresca’s search for unpredictability lies behind Chelsea’s transfer strategy,"Spending may seem scattergun but new weapons, from Liam Delap to João Pedro, will help Chelsea tackle low blocks",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/01/chelsea-enzo-maresca-search-for-unpredictability-transfer-strategy,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 10:26:09",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"When Enzo Maresca became Chelsea’s head coach last summer, those who had studied the Italian’s tactics at Leicester predicted his appointment would accelerate the end of Ben Chilwell’s time at Stamford Bridge. “Enzo doesn’t play with a left-back,” a source said. “Chilwell won’t be able to do what Enzo wants. He just won’t play him.”
The prediction was spot-on, with Chilwell quickly discounted from selection. It was nothing personal, though. The logic was merely that Maresca does not play with a conventional back four in possession but wants one full-back inverting and the other shifting inside to play as an extra centre-back in a 3-2-4-1 system.
It is far from foolproof, as anyone who saw Malo Gusto’s disastrous first-half turn as an auxiliary midfielder in the Conference League final against Real Betis will confirm. Yet Maresca has his way of playing and is comfortable without overlapping full-backs. He has often had speedy wingers playing high, tasked with going one-on-one against a defender. Marc Cucurella has been the inverter from left-back. Instead of being a rampaging force from right-back, Reece James has often drifted infield.
The effect is numerical superiority in the middle. The drawback is that wide players become isolated in Maresca’s team. Chelsea often struggled against low blocks during the second half of last season, particularly if it was a back five, and there was a lot of discussion about whether Mareca’s football was overly rigid.
Qualification for the Champions League became a grind. Chelsea finished fourth and won the Conference League but there was an issue to address. How to be less predictable? Ponder that for a moment and the decision to derail Newcastle’s move for Brighton forward João Pedro becomes easier to understand.
There will inevitably be accusations of stockpiling. The attack was already well stocked before Liam Delap joined from Ipswich and a deal for the Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens was agreed. There’s also Estêvão Willian, who joins from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup, and suggestions that Chelsea could sign another forward. They continue to monitor the Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and like West Ham’s Mohammed Kudus because of the Tottenham target’s ability to play in three positions.
Delap and Gittens were far obvious moves than João Pedro, though. Delap was needed to provide healthy competition for Nicolas Jackson up front and Gittens fills a hole given that Chelsea need at least one right-footed left-winger. The left-footed Pedro Neto and Noni Madueke are uncomfortable fits on the left. They prefer cutting inside from the right. Estêvão is another left-footer who cuts inside.
Chelsea know something has to give. Geovany Quenda, another gifted young winger, joins from Sporting next summer. No wonder Chelsea will listen to offers for Madueke. A mission to trim the squad is under way; the arrival of João Pedro in a deal worth more than £50m is expected to result in Christopher Nkunku leaving.
Nkunku scored the winner when Chelsea beat Benfica in the last 16 of the Club World Cup but he is not quite right for Maresca. João Pedro is regarded as a better profile than the France forward and João Félix, who is also out of favour. Perhaps he will complement Cole Palmer, lifting the creative burden on Chelsea’s main man. Palmer needs opportunities to rest. It is going to be another gruelling campaign and Chelsea are mindful about the Champions League increasing the demands on their squad.
Maresca will have to rotate more in the league and he will benefit from having different modes of attack. There is no point having an array of speedy wingers if they are effective only in transition. Chelsea need different angles in attack. They are probably not going to get much intricate link play from Delap, who is more of an old-school No 9. Jackson is better at dropping off, turning and playing reverse balls – as he did for Neto’s goal against Los Angeles FC – but is more chaotic.

João Pedro offers a different profile. He presses well, drops deep and could play with Palmer as a second striker. The Brazilian was adept at receiving possession and releasing Brighton’s wingers with clever angled passes. He could do the same for Gittens and Neto. Chelsea will hope they are signing a player who can draw negative opponents out, move defences around and create space for others. It is not the obvious move, but it feels like a canny one.
It is about options and collaboration. Neto has three goals in three appearances at the Club World Cup and is loved at Chelsea for his work rate. João Pedro’s output at Brighton was nothing spectacular – 30 goals and 10 assists in 70 appearances – but Maresca wants his attack to share the load and become more versatile.
It helps to explain why Maresca has experimented in the US, hitting on a 3-2-4-1 in possession against Benfica, with Palmer’s role as an inside-left leaving space for Cucurella to maraud. Predicting Chelsea’s starting XI will become almost impossible. The system will be complex, leaving no space for someone of Chilwell’s profile. Sometimes it could be heavy on wingers, at other times there could be two No 10s. For a shape-shifter such as Maresca, it seems variety is the spice of life.

Rodri suffers injury setback as Manchester City count cost of Club World Cup exit,Spaniard substituted in fifth game since returning,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/01/manchester-city-al-hilal-club-world-cup-pep-guardiola-rodri,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 05:34:16",Jamie Jackson,['Manchester City'],"After Manchester City crashed out of the Club World Cup 4-3 to Al-Hilal in Orlando, Pep Guardiola blamed a lack of ruthlessness, and said Rodri had sustained an injury setback.
City were eliminated by Marcus Leonardo’s 112th-minute winner on Monday night at the Camping World Stadium in the shock result of the inaugural 32-team Club World Cup. Guardiola’s team wasted a number of chances, with Jérémy Doku, Erling Haaland, Josko Gvardiol, Rúben Dias and Savinho among those who failed to put City out of sight in the opening half.
Guardiola said: “In the end we have to score and be clinical. They did not create much in the first half, we did but could not finish it. I had a feeling we could go through. We allow them to make transitions [but] we created a lot. It is a pity, we have been on an incredible journey together [here] and in a good place. The vibe was really good, I cannot thank Manchester City enough and especially the players for training and how they have been playing.”
Rodri came on in the 53rd minute but was forced off in the 100th. The midfielder was making only a fifth appearance since returning from a serious knee injury. The manager said Rodri “complained about his situation”.
City opened the scoring on nine minutes through Bernardo Silva, then goals on 46 and 53 minutes from Leonardo and Malcom gave Al-Hilal the lead. Haaland equalised two minutes later to take the tie into extra time and after Kalidou Koulibaly’s strike was answered by Phil Foden, Leonardo got the winner.
Guardiola said: “We would have loved to have continued, it is only here every four years. We had a feeling that the team is doing well but now we go home and it is time to rest [physically] and rest our minds for the new season.”
The manager was asked whether enough has been seen for him to believe City can challenge again next season, having cast doubt on that before the match. “It is too early to say,” Guardiola replied. “But there have been so many good things I did not see in the [recent] past. The relationship between the players, our captain [Silva] helped a lot and the standards from our staff. I felt we were happy here, the training sessions have been really good. [But] Al-Hilal has a lot of quality. They are a complete team that can run and run – I have a big opinion of them but we [still] did a good game.”
The club’s elimination closed a torrid campaign which featured a dismal Premier League title defence and an FA Cup final defeat by Crystal Palace. A defiant Silva said: “When we start the Premier League, we will forget and focus on having a great season. We’ve had a lot of frustrations in the past as well, and we managed to come back. We’re going to try and do that again, knowing that we have a lot of competition.”
Silva, who said the players were waiting to be told when they must report again for training, believes the defeat by Al-Hilal shows the strength of the global game. “Football has never been only in Europe,” the Portugal international said.
The Al-Hilal manager, Simone Inzaghi, was full of praise for his side: “Tonight we had to do something extraordinary because we knew how good Manchester City are. We knew we had to climb Mount Everest without oxygen and we were great. Guardiola is the best coach in the world but tonight we did our best and we deserved the result.”

What a beautiful tale … right? The full-time whistle brought those scenes we know well from the real World Cup. Players on their knees: the victors turning to the heavens, the losers sucked into the dirt. Simone Inzaghi looked a particularly happy chap just weeks on from his nadir, that Bigger Cup embarrassment with Inter against PSG. Manchester City, the European heavyweights, had just been defeated by his brave underdogs, Al-Hilal. Yes, those same longshots who two years ago tried to buy Kylian Mbappé from PSG for £259m, shortly after coming under the ownership of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.
The PIF – which appears intent on clawing its mitts over sport – is the investment arm of a journalist-killing state and chaired by the big man himself, Mohammed bin Salman. The fund is also an official partner of Copa Gianni while a PIF subsidiary bought a $1bn stake in Dazn, the tournament broadcaster, earlier this year. They didn’t get Mbappé but they still nabbed Neymar. Al-Hilal may have delivered a sporting upset – “We knew we had to climb Mount Everest without oxygen and we were great,” proclaimed Inzaghi – but this isn’t a plucky underdog story. And no, that doesn’t make City a group of saints.
It’s finally summer time for Pep Guardiola, though a nagging feeling will follow, the question left to be answered on how these few weeks in the USA USA USA will impact his side next season/this season (the lines feel blurred with this tournament). Prior to the Al-Hilal match he had wondered out loud if his club will be “destroyed” by the Copa Gianni when their regular commitments resume. An extra couple of weeks on the beach – the final is still another 12 days away – could end up being a decent consolation.
Plenty of powerhouses remain, though they remain stuck on one side of the draw; PSG have Bayern in the quarters, with the winner potentially facing Real Madrid in the semi-finals. Chelsea supporters should perhaps allow themselves to believe; they must beat Palmeiras if they want to set up a possible semi-final clash with Al-Hilal. The gaudy wastefulness of a project that has turned Brighton into a de-facto academy against the pillar of a behemoth propaganda machine. Let the beautiful game commence.

The Club World Cup that wasn’t: how fake highlights took over the internet,"Using clever tactics and Messi clickbait, Egyptian creators racked up 14m views with highlights posted before kickoff. YouTube didn’t catch on until it was too late",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/01/fake-club-world-cup-highlights-youtube-scam,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:30:00",Club World Cup 2025,['Manchester City'],"This story was reported by Indicator, a publication that investigates digital deception, and co-published with the Guardian.
It was Thursday morning in America and something didn’t look right in the highlights of the Club World Cup match between Manchester City and Juventus.
The video in front of me was the top result on both YouTube and Google Search’s video tab for the game in Orlando. More than 700,000 people had already watched the best moments of the riveting 3-2 matchup. And yet, footage showed City head coach Pep Guardiola all bundled up in a puffer jacket ill-suited to humid Florida summers.
On a couple of occasions, the commentators on the video referred to the Juventus goalkeeper as Martin Dúbravka. He actually plays for Newcastle, a totally unrelated team that wears a black-and-white jersey similar to that worn by the Italian side.
Oh, also? The match wasn’t on until several hours later.
The Club World Cup is the controversial brainchild of Fifa president Gianni Infantino, pitting 32 clubs from around the world in a replica of the World Cup played by national sides. Attendance numbers have been so-so, but the money at stake is huge. Crucially, online interest has been strong. Globally, Google searches for the tournament have dwarfed those for Donald Trump, even on the day the US president announced America would bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities.
YouTube has long failed to keep fake highlights and livestreams of football games off its platform. But these have typically been recreated from video games, making them easy to spot as soon as you’ve opened the video.
Now, a group of gaming creators based in Egypt developed a winning formula that combined repackaged clips from old games, obsessive interest in star players like Lionel Messi, and data voids, to get clicks and ad revenue.
Messi’s crazy hat-tricks
Earlier this year, the Egyptian gaming creator Mohamed Reda started posting highlight reels of the MLS team Inter Miami on his YouTube channel Reda Bow. These videos always promised a “Crazy Hat-Trick” by eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi and atypical score lines like 9-3 or 7-4. Like the Man City v Juventus highlights above, the clips were in reality just medleys of old goals. Reda Bow’s fake highlights did increasingly well: videos posted in April got 40,000 to 60,000 views but by June his videos were being seen 300,000 times. Then came the Club World Cup.
Reda and two other Egyptian gaming creators started posting the same templated highlights across several YouTube accounts they managed. They focused on the buzzier games that featured Messi or top European teams like Manchester City and Real Madrid.
Crucially, they posted the fake highlights 24 to 48 hours before the matches started. There was little competition for video content about the game before the game. The channels were also verified and had hundreds of thousands of subscribers. The content was fresh and seemingly authoritative, so Google and YouTube’s algorithms ranked it highly. So what if the videos defied not only the time continuum but also basic math by promising a “Messi Hat-Trick” even when Inter Miami had only purportedly scored two goals.
The operation’s takeover was absolutely comprehensive – just look at the Google Search video tab results for three CWC matches held last week. Videos from the Egyptian creators appear in the top four slots across every game, each with a slightly different scoreline for games that had yet to be played.
The scheme worked. Collectively, 30-odd videos pushed out by the trio were seen 14m times over two weeks.
All of the channels were monetized and ran ads for everything from Chase and B&H to Grubhub and Spectrum. Ironically, the videos also made money from ads for tickets for Club World Cup matches. (Fifa ignored multiple requests for comment.)
Because no deep dive into scams is complete without some AI garbage, the videos also ran ads for questionable diets fronted by a synthetically edited Oprah Winfrey (and many other AI-generated personas).
The hundreds of comments on the videos fall into two categories. About 40% of users don’t appear to recognize the deception and post enthusiastic remarks about Lionel Messi or putdowns of his archnemesis Cristiano Ronaldo.
The remainder call out the fact that the highlights aren’t real. One despairing viewer wrote “can’t believe 800k+ people clicked on this and the game has not happened yet.“ My personal favorite is a user who wrote “You are very good at making hundreds of thousands or millions of moths come to watch.” (I’m assuming it sounds even better in the original Thai.)
All of the videos in this scheme included a few minutes at the end that showed the channel owner playing a video game like eFootball.
After the games falsely represented in the videos were played, the creators updated the title to the actual score. When view growth started slowing down because interest in the game faded, they trimmed the entire highlights element out of the video and left only the final clip of them playing the video game. This bait-and-switch served to both drive ad revenue and juice up historical numbers on the channel for newcomers.
I reached out to YouTube about the videos and was acknowledged on Friday. By that evening, the platform had removed all videos under its policies against spam, deceptive practices and scams. It also terminated all the channels involved but by the time of publication had not gotten back to me on the motivation. At least one fake highlight reel with almost 1m views was still live, however.
The fake highlights scheme was juicy enough that several other YouTube channels got in on the fun, scraping the Egyptians’ fake highlights or making some of their own. (Some of this stuff also made it on TikTok, collecting millions of views there.)
The videos appear on channels whose purpose is entirely unrelated to football – including cooking, fishing, farming and bird breeding channels. I assume these are old accounts taken over by a scam operation, but I haven’t had time to dig any further. Here are some pigeon videos in case that’s your thing.
So what?
The stakes here appear lower than the average Indicator story about deceptive behavior online. Viewers who fell for these videos may have been a little disappointed to realize what happened. At a stretch, some may have even gambled one way or another based on the videos.
But if a user didn’t know what time the game was on, failed to recognize the outdated spliced clips, and went on to comment “MESSI” underneath the videos, they probably weren’t in the market for sophisticated football analysis anyway.
YouTube and its advertisers definitely lost some money from this deceptive operation, but it’s hard to feel too bad for either of them.
What matters here is less the fake content itself than the behavioral deception that enabled it to succeed.
On one of the most searched topics of the moment, a group of young YouTube creators were able to outwit Google’s ranking and moderation and surge to the top of results. By trimming videos after publication, they also showed the vulnerability of a functionality that can very easily be abused for more nefarious purposes – for instance, posting incendiary remarks to drive referral traffic from other platforms then trim them out in time to avoid getting flagged for any policy violation.
For what it’s worth, Manchester City actually trounced Juventus 5-2.

Football transfer rumours: Manchester United switch focus to Ollie Watkins?,Today’s rumours aren’t going out in this weather,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/01/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-united-ollie-watkins-aston-villa-nicolas-jackson,"Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:26:54",Tom Davies,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United’s search for a suitable striker continues to occupy the minds of the gossip-mongers, with Ollie Watkins now reported to be firmly on Ruben Amorim’s radar. As United toil to get a deal for Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo over the line, amid rumours the Cameroon striker may be persuaded to remain in west London, Aston Villa’s Watkins has emerged as a strong target, the Athletic reports. However, a deal may be dependent on Rasmus Højlund being bundled out of the Old Trafford exit door.
United also continue to be dogged by the “How do you solve a problem like Marcus Rashford?” conundrum; the striker faces starting the season at Old Trafford because Aston Villa will not be taking up the £40m option to sign him.
Instead, Villa are reportedly keen on a swoop for Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson, as Unai Emery pursues a reunion with a forward he worked with at Villarreal. The Senegal striker has had a mixed time of it at Stamford Bridge and may be a handy fit for Villa, who could free up some cash with their selling-the-women’s-team accountancy wheeze.
Monday’s Hugo Etikite rumour had Arsenal muscling their way towards the front of the queue to sign the Eintracht Frankfurt forward. But now Liverpool have been heavily linked with Etikite again, Bild reporting that the Premier League champions have contacted Frankfurt with strong expressions of interest. He’ll end up in the English top flight one way or other, the Mill feels sure.
Heading in the opposite direction could be Luis Díaz, to whom Bayern Munich have taken a fancy. For all the recent focus on the incoming Stuttgart wonderkid Nick Woltemade, the German champions are also keen on an experienced wide attacker and Díaz could fit the bill.
Fulham are preparing a bid for the highly regarded Genk forward Tolu Arokodare, scorer of 17 goals in the Belgian top flight last season. The 6ft 4in Nigerian striker has also attracted interest from Milan and Manchester United, but Fulham have taken their interest the furthest, with exploratory talks having already been held with Arokodare’s people, according to the Sun.
James McAtee’s success with England Under-21s has upped both his price tag and the number of clubs linked with him. Leeds, who tried to sign the Manchester City midfielder on loan in January, still want to lure him across the Pennines but face competition from the Bundesliga in the form of Borussia Dortmund, Leipzig, Stuttgart, Eintracht Frankfurt and Leverkusen, say the Times. And City will want about £30m.
Elsewhere, Richarlison could be heading to Galatasaray after being given approval to do one from Tottenham. Also Turkey-bound, it seems, is Tammy Abraham, who is due to join Besiktas from Roma in a €15m deal.
In the Championship, Hull are close to finalising a deal for Aston Villa’s Louie Barry, who tore up League One in the first half of last season when on loan at Stockport before an injury-dogged loan spell at the MKM Stadium after Christmas. Jonjo Shelvey has also been training with the Tigers.
Elsewhere in the English second tier, West Brom have been linked with the QPR forward Charlie Kelman, League One’s top scorer last season while on loan at Leyton Orient, while TV’s Wrexham appear to have overreached themselves in a bid for Fulham’s Tom Cairney, but have been strongly linked with Sheffield Wednesday’s Barry Bannan and Reading’s Charlie Savage as Phil Parkinson seeks midfield reinforcements.
