"Two clubs, two strikers - the key questions on Isak and Ekitike",Sky Sports takes a look at the striker tug of war going on at Newcastle and Liverpool involving Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike - and answers the key questions on the transfer saga.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13397465/alexander-isak-and-hugo-ekitike-transfer-news-which-striker-will-newcastle-and-liverpool-move-for-in-transfer-window,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 08:15:00",,['Liverpool'],"Sky Sports takes a look at the striker tug of war going on at Newcastle and Liverpool involving Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike - and answers the key questions on the transfer saga.
Liverpool appear to be focusing on a deal for Hugo Ekitike after being told by Newcastle that Isak is not for sale.
A day after Newcastle saw a club-record £70m bid for Ekitike rejected, the Reds opened talks with Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday.
Sky Sports News has always believed that Isak is Liverpool's first-choice striker target - but Ekitike has always been among their leading alternatives.
His game is very similar to Isak's and he would be cheaper, yet with potential to become one of the Premier League's marquee strikers after a successful year in Germany.
Liverpool's relative lack of activity in the last few windows is a key reason why their finances are healthy.
The club's financial records indicated they could potentially lose a further £200m this summer and still be compliant with Profit & Sustainability Rules (PSR) - where clubs are permitted to lose £105m over a three-year period.
According to football finance expert Swiss Ramble, the Reds' most recent financial results showed Liverpool have actually made £48m in the current three-year PSR period, partly due to modest recent transfer spend.
That means Liverpool can lose a further £158m and still be compliant next summer.
And while Liverpool have already spent around £185m on new players in the current window - including a fee of up to £116m for Florian Wirtz - the Reds posted a club record revenue of £613.8m for the 2023-24 season, partly due to commercial success.
That figure will only increase on the 2024-25 season accounts given Liverpool added Champions League football, knockout qualification for that tournament and also became Premier League champions.
Academy product Jarell Quansah has already joined Bayer Leverkusen in a £35m deal that represents 100 per cent profit under PSR rules, and the Reds could further boost sales figures by the end of the summer.
Darwin Nunez, Harvey Elliott and Luiz Diaz are all further potential departures, although a Diaz exit is currently less likely despite Bayern Munich's attempts to prise him away.
While the situation around the two clubs and the two strikers concerned is complicated, many have already simplified the situation to Liverpool presenting Newcastle with this dilemma: sell us your star striker or we'll move for your main striker target instead.
Given Ekitike has always been a player Liverpool have wanted, and Newcastle have stood firm on Isak, it is more likely that Liverpool have made one final check on whether Isak is possible before putting their eggs into the Ekitike basket.
As Premier League title winners, Liverpool are attractive potential employers.
But timing is key for Newcastle, who tried to sign Ekitike in summer 2022, before he decided to go to PSG.
If Isak doesn't go this summer, the Swedish international is very likely to go next year.
Recruiting Ekitike now would allow Newcastle to get him up to speed this season before he potentially takes over the mantle of the main man next summer. It would also give Newcastle the freedom to make a choice on Isak because buying Ekitike (or any other striker) would be cheaper now than after the prospect of a record sale to Liverpool. Clubs would know Newcastle have money to burn and would up their prices.
The Magpies have already missed out on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro - both to Chelsea - and may now have to go back to the drawing board again.
However, if they are gazumped again, there are plenty more top options on the market, including Benjamin Sesko and Yoane Wissa.
Newcastle have plenty of strategic thinking to do.
It's a fascinating proposition, were the pendulum to swing back in Newcastle's favour.
Whether Eddie Howe was looking at a 4-2-4 with Anthony Elanga and Anthony Gordon flanking the duo on the wings, or moving one star forward out wide to utilise them both, we might never know.
But Ekitike would unlikely have been signed to sit on the bench, with the plan for him to complement Isak - this season at least - as had been the hope for Joao Pedro before he opted for Chelsea instead.
Isak and Ekitike are very similar players. Not only are the striker pair's league numbers last season almost identical, but they also adopt similar areas of the pitch.
Ekitike's heat and pass maps hints at them doing many of the same things - dropping deep towards the centre circle but maintaining a penalty box presence.
With Champions League football and so many games, it would probably have been more likely that they were interchangeable than deployable as a front two.
Jamie Carragher said earlier this summer Liverpool need a centre forward and they have wanted to make a change in that position by allowing Darwin Nunez to potentially leave.
It looks now as though they will push for Ekitike and have a good chance of getting him - but it is still possible they end up with neither.
It will certainly take more than what would have been a Newcastle club-record bid of £70m to get Ekitike out of Frankfurt.
There is no shortage of striker options in the current market. Victor Osimhen is certainly a player Liverpool have had on their radar for a while as well as Benjamin Sesko.
Another player the Reds have been reportedly linked with is Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, who was a target for Arsenal in January, but he is 29 and would present a shift in direction.
Liverpool's move for Ekitike has been given greater encouragement than Newcastle's as it stands but in football - not least in the transfer window - there are no guarantees. One phone call and suddenly everything shifts...

Liverpool open talks to sign Ekitike,Liverpool have opened talks with Eintracht Frankfurt to sign Hugo Ekitike.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13397155/hugo-ekitike-transfer-news-liverpool-open-talks-with-eintracht-frankfurt-for-striker-amid-newcastle-interest,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 15:45:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have opened talks with Eintracht Frankfurt to sign Hugo Ekitike.
The club have made their approach after Sky Sports News revealed on Tuesday they were expected to rival Newcastle for the striker.
Sky Sports News understands Newcastle are aware of Liverpool's interest and reviewing their options.
Liverpool have moved for Ekitike after being told Alexander Isak is not for sale in this window.
The Premier League champions have always been interested in Isak but it is understood Newcastle have no interest in selling their striker and value him at least at £150m.
The Reds have been scoping out the market all summer for possible centre-forward options, establishing availability and price - but they have not made an offer for Isak.
Sources on Merseyside insist no formal contact has been made between the clubs, contrary to reports elsewhere.
Sky Sports News reported on Tuesday that Frankfurt rejected Newcastle's formal £70m bid for Ekitike, with the Bundesliga club valuing the striker at £85m.
Newcastle held talks with Ekitike's representatives in Austria on Monday, as they look to sign the striker they have kept tabs on for a number of years.
Newcastle tried and failed to sign Ekitike in 2022 when he chose Paris Saint-Germain instead. Frankfurt then paid PSG just £14m for the 23-year-old last summer.
Isak is Newcastle's current club-record signing after he joined in a £63m deal from Real Sociedad in August 2022.
Ekitike scored 22 goals in 48 games across all competitions last season for Frankfurt as he helped them qualify for the Champions League.
He has been a Manchester United target this summer after the club explored the conditions of a deal, while Chelsea have also been interested along with Liverpool.
Newcastle have spent £55m on one major summer signing so far following the arrival of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest.
Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth on The Transfer Show:
""If we just take this on face value, Alexander Isak is of interest to Liverpool. Newcastle have said Isak is not for sale.
""Hugo Ekitike is a player that Liverpool and Newcastle are both interested in. So, at face value, fine. We don't need to worry about Isak anymore because he's not for sale. So clearly that story's gone.
""But we do know that when a club is interested in a player, then somewhere along the line, there must have been some sort of encouragement.
""I'm not saying that's happened in this case, but usually if a club approaches another club, it is because somewhere along the line, there has been some sort of encouragement.
""Newcastle hold the cards here. Isak has got three years left on his contract. They don't have to sell. They've got a player under contract. They're paying him good money.
""He hasn't gone physically up to Newcastle and said 'I want to go'. And even if he did, Newcastle don't have to do anything because he's under contract.
""But this interest in Isak and the subsequent noise around Ekitike poses the question: is there more to these two deals than meets the eye?
""Do they want him to play alongside Isak next season? Or is he looked at as a replacement for Isak either next season or further along the line, maybe next summer if Isak is eventually to leave Newcastle?
""Liverpool conveniently now are interested in Ekitike as well. They are told by Newcastle Isak's not for sale and they're now pursuing Newcastle's No 1 target. Coincidence? Maybe.
""Otherwise, the cynic in every one of us thinks something else is going on here.""
Sky Sports' Adam Bate:
When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.
""These were players with similar profiles from teams that were better than our team, but not at the distance Paris Saint-Germain were from us,"" Oscar Garcia, Reims' then head coach, told Sky Sports. ""We challenged him to reach the level of the other two strikers.""
On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.
He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. ""Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.""
It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League.
""He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,"" concedes Oscar. ""They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.""

Bournemouth sign Chelsea goalkeeper Petrovic,Bournemouth have signed goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea for &#163;25m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13397486/djordje-petrovic-signs-for-bournemouth-chelsea-goalkeeper-joins-premier-league-rivals-in-25m-move,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 14:15:00",,['Chelsea'],"Bournemouth have signed goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea for £25m.
The Serbia international spent last season on loan at Ligue 1 side Strasbourg, who are part of the same multi-club ownership model as Chelsea.
Petrovic was the first-choice goalkeeper at Chelsea in the second half of the 2023/24 season under Mauricio Pochettino, but lost his place under Enzo Maresca to Robert Sanchez.
Chelsea signed Petrovic for £14m in the summer of 2023 from MLS side New England Revolution.
Bournemouth have been looking for a goalkeeper having had Kepa Arrizabalaga on loan from Chelsea last season. The Spaniard signed for Arsenal this summer while Bournemouth also sold 'keeper Mark Travers to Everton.
Petrovic is Bournemouth's first significant outlay on a goalkeeper since they were promoted to the Premier League in 2015.
He was viewed as a good market opportunity once it became clear he was available after an impressive season in France.
Bournemouth felt he was the best goalkeeper in Ligue 1 last season, where he made 31 appearances and kept 10 clean sheets.
With Chelsea splashing the cash on the top end of the pitch, it is worth remembering they are selling well too. Noni Madueke's £52m move to Arsenal is about to be confirmed and the sale of Djordje Petrovic will make it £77m in major fees from sales this summer.
It makes you wonder whether Chelsea are doing the right thing by handing first-team players to Premier League rivals. Especially in Petrovic's case.
Robert Sanchez's position as Chelsea No 1 has been challenged in recent years. Poor performances and high-profile mistakes plagued him last season - while Chelsea's pursuit of AC Milan's Mike Maignan hinted they may be prepared to move on from the Spaniard.
But Enzo Maresca has stuck with Sanchez and his place as Chelsea's No 1 looks sealed after their victorious Club World Cup campaign, where he made a couple of key saves in the final.
But should Petrovic - who was Chelsea's No 1 before Maresca's arrival - have been given another chance?
The Serbian goalkeeper had a standout season at Strasbourg, where he was one of the best goalkeepers in Ligue 1.
His save percentage of 74.5 per cent ranked second in France's top-flight, ahead of PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma. But instead of Stamford Bridge, he will end up at Bournemouth.
Compared to Sanchez and Kepa - who was Chelsea's loaned out goalkeeper to Bournemouth last season - Petrovic was the standout player apart form one key area - coming off his line.
Perhaps Maresca is sticking with his goalkeeper that is suited to dealing with Chelsea's high line. But it is clear that Petrovic excelled over the alternative options in most other departments.

How can Liverpool afford Isak after spending so much?,Liverpool have spent more than £170m on players this summer and are rumoured to be interested in Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8xv2rndzj7o,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 14:15:50",Joe Rindl,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have spent more than £170m this summer already - and now are interested in a player they would have to break the British transfer record to sign.
With a package for Newcastle United's Alexander Isak thought to cost up to £130m, their summer spending would soar to £300m.
It's quite the jump.
The Premier League champions last year spent just £10m on Italy winger Federico Chiesa and £25m on Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili in last year's summer window.
Liverpool have already signed midfielder Florian Wirtz in a potential British record £116m deal this summer and paid £40m and £30m respectively for full-backs Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong.
Their sights are now firmly set on a striker.
BBC Sport understands that, while Liverpool have explored other centre-forward targets, they have made a move towards a deal for Isak in recent days.
While he remains the dream target, the Reds also have serious interest in Hugo Ekitike for whom Newcastle had a £70m bid turned down on Tuesday by Eintracht Frankfurt.
Liverpool have also checked in on Brentford's Yoane Wissa and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins as they work through a range of striker options.
So how can Arne Slot's side afford to spend so much on players, and do they have the budget to spend even more?
Can Liverpool afford Isak?
Liverpool's income has been boosted this year thanks to several key factors.
They received £175m in prize money for winning the Premier League; last season was the club's first full campaign with an expanded Anfield Road End and a higher capacity; and from 1 August they have a new kit deal with Adidas which some reports value at £60m per season, more than their current partnership with Nike.
Those factors, combined with comparatively low transfer spending in previous windows, mean Liverpool find themselves well within the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) which limit clubs to losses of £105m over three years.
""Liverpool are a super smart football club,"" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.
""They're in an incredibly strong PSR position. Out of the traditional big six clubs, they've spent the least in this three-year cycle - only £325m - and that includes their signing of Florian Wirtz.
""They've still got plenty of wiggle room with their transfer budget. Plus, a move for a striker is likely to be paid in instalments, meaning the cost can be spread over multiple seasons.""
Their position could be further boosted. On Tuesday they rejected a £58.6m opening offer from Bayern Munich for forward Luis Diaz.
While Liverpool have said Diaz is not for sale, they are understood to be open to selling Darwin Nunez, who has interest from Napoli and Saudi Arabia.
'Liverpool's model has been to ignore the noise'
As shown in the graph above, in the three seasons prior to 2024-25 Liverpool made net transfer spends of -£17.8m, £92.5m and £49.8m.
For context, Manchester United have had a net spend of £119m, £133m and £190m over their past three campaigns.
""Liverpool have been outside the top-10 spenders on player signings since 2019, but their model is a classic case of being smarter rather than bigger,"" said Maguire.
""Liverpool's model has been to ignore the noise and only buy a player if they truly improve the squad. It's a Moneyball,, external more analytical approach.
""Chief executive Michael Edwards does a brilliant job and he never buys players because of external pressure. He doesn't get jittery when fans call for more signings.
""Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and potentially Isak are big signings, but they all improve the Liverpool squad, and the Reds do have an awful lot of PSR headroom.""
Last month, former Reds boss Jurgen Klopp described the £116m potential fee for Wirtz as ""insane"".
Klopp, who won the Champions League and Premier League during a nine-year spell at Anfield before he left in the summer of 2024, felt transfer fees were rising at a rapid rate.
""I know I once said I'm out if we pay 100m euros for a player, but the world keeps changing - that's how the market is,"" he said.
Before Wirtz's arrival, Nunez had been the club's record signing, joining from Benfica in June 2022 in a deal that could be worth up to £85m.
But Klopp's big signings were largely spread out across different transfer windows during his time at the club.
The Reds signed defender Virgil van Dijk for £75m from Southampton in January 2018, goalkeeper Alisson from Roma for £66.8m in July 2018 and midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai for £60m from RB Leipzig in July 2023.
Who else could be interested in Isak?
Newcastle have maintained throughout the summer that their top players - and Isak is certainly one of those - are not for sale.
Indeed, like Liverpool, Newcastle - who are owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) - are in a comfortable PSR position.
Isak has three years left on his contract, so the Swede would most likely have to actively push for a move.
Apart from Liverpool, few other clubs in the market for a striker could afford Isak's reported £130m price tag.
""As the most profitable club in Premier League history, Arsenal could easily spend over £200m in the window and have no PSR concerns,"" said Maguire.
Despite Isak having been linked with a move to Arsenal, the Gunners are instead expected to reach a full agreement with Sporting for the 73.5m euros (£63.5m) signing of striker Viktor Gyokeres this summer.
Manchester City are unlikely to be in the market for a striker, with Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush under lengthy contracts.
It seems doubtful that United would be able to afford Isak's fee without significant player sales, having missed out on Champions League football next season.
Chelsea have bought strikers Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this window.
""In theory, Tottenham could also afford Isak,"" said Maguire. ""But whether the player would want to move from a team who finished fifth to one who finished 17th is a whole other story.""

Bournemouth sign Petrovic for £25m - were Chelsea right to cash in?,Bournemouth complete the £25m signing of Serbia goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgq7jle544eo,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 17:29:44",Sean Kearns,['Chelsea'],"Bournemouth have completed the £25m signing of Chelsea goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic on a five-year deal.
The Serb, who joined Chelsea from New England Revolution in a £14m deal in 2023, spent last season on loan at French club Strasbourg.
The 25-year-old was named player of the season as Strasbourg secured a Europa Conference League spot by finishing seventh in Ligue 1.
Despite claiming the Chelsea number one spot under Mauricio Pochettino, Petrovic - who made 23 appearances during the 2023-24 season - was sent on loan to France last summer because of concerns about his ability to play out from the back.
Although Petrovic's passing stats did not notably improve during his season on loan, his distribution has been more accurate than Robert Sanchez's.
The current Chelsea number one posted lower figures for pass accuracy and long pass accuracy. Meanwhile, back-up goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen finished with a better record than both.
Where Petrovic stood out with Strasbourg was in his shot-stopping.
He prevented almost 10 goals more than an average goalkeeper would save, based on the expected goals on target (xGOT) model.
That total was the sixth highest in Europe's top five leagues last season.
Sanchez, however, excelled as Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup, where he won the Golden Glove given to the tournament's best goalkeeper.
The Spaniard made several key saves in the final against Paris St-Germain, also impressing with some pinpoint passes to set up attacks.
Despite occasional shaky moments last term, he seems likely to remain Chelsea's number one for the new season.
Kepa replacement 'wants to grow'
Petrovic - who has seven caps for Serbia - becomes Bournemouth's third signing of the summer.
""I came to Bournemouth because I want to grow and I want to play at the best level,"" said Petrovic.
""Together with this club, with these facilities, I think we can achieve it. I want to help the team get the results, improve every day and be a better player.""
Petrovic replaces former Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga who joined Arsenal in a £5m deal this month.
Kepa replaced Bournemouth's Neto at Arsenal - who was on loan from the Cherries during the 2024-25 campaign - but has now returned to the south coast with his future uncertain.
'Neuer comparisons in Germany'
The strong interest from many clubs this summer for Petrovic comes as no surprise to football fans back home - he is living the best of his days.
Last season he helped Strasbourg finish seventh and resulted in a place in the Serbia national squad, where he has now won seven caps.
Saving a penalty in the World Cup qualifier against Albania - a match charged with tension because of politics and history - even earned him national-hero status.
The German media compared him to Manuel Neuer, one of the best goalkeepers of the century, because of their similar height, footwork and pass accuracy.
His former coaches commend Petrovic's physical attributes, noting his strength in the air and willingness to come off his line, particularly noting his effectiveness in one-on-one situations and at stopping penalties.
Up until his move to Chelsea in 2023 from Major League Soccer side New England Revolution, he was a relatively unknown name in Serbia.
He came up through Cukaricki, a club from the capital of Belgrade, that has a notably smaller fanbase than the two Belgrade giants, Red Star and Partizan.
His move to the United States did not do much for his visibility, but he did win a place in the MLS All-Star squad - before his £12.5m switch to the Premier League made him the most expensive Serbian keeper in history.

Problems piling up for Ruben Amorim as Manchester United struggle to rebuild | Jamie Jackson,"The ‘infamous five’ told to train separately, lack of new signings and a restricted budget – United’s manager is stuck in summer of discontent",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/17/problems-piling-up-for-ruben-amorim-as-manchester-united-struggle-to-rebuild,"Thu, 17 Jul 2025 07:00:32",Jamie Jackson,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","The on-off Bryan Mbeumo saga and Liam Delap choosing Chelsea are troubling bellwethers of Manchester United’s predicament a month from the start of the season. So, too, is having half an outfield first team in a bomb squad that skulks in for training in the late afternoon when those not in the same club-decreed quasi-shame have left for the day.
As time ticks towards Arsenal’s opening Premier League Sunday visit and, beyond, to the window’s close on 1 September, Ruben Amorim can hardly be ecstatic at how the summer is progressing. The head coach has added only Matheus Cunha from Wolves, for the forward’s £62.5m release clause, a sizeable chunk of a transfer budget constricted by a looming debt mountain and the need to sell to buy a No 9 and, possibly, finally prise Mbeumo from Brentford.
Here we come to the infamous five: Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are a quintet who, United claim, have informed the executive they want transfers. They have been ordered to train separately, which they are doing – at 5pm. It is hard to escape picturing them sneaking into Carrington as naughty schoolboys when Amorim and his squad have cleared the facility.
United remain in flux – some may even insist chaos. Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s back-of-house operation will have dramatically cut back the 1,100-plus employees he inherited when the latest round of redundancies is over, and the on-field product lost May’s desultory Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao, finished an all-time Premier League low of 15th with 42 points and a minus 10 goal difference and was, according to Christian Eriksen, lucky not to be relegated.
The Dane, who left this summer, has a case. Although United were 17 points clear of 18th-placed Leicester, an argument can be made that Amorim’s side were a prolonged Bruno Fernandes injury away from a survival dogfight – at least.
Fernandes is one more curio of a Ratcliffe project that has already lost a football director (Dan Ashworth) and a manager (Erik ten Hag). The oddity is that the captain has also not gone through the exit door. Reject £100m for a footballer who will be 31 three matches into the season at a club that lost £300m in the last three years and is £1bn-plus in debt?
Strange is one verdict of the decision from Ratcliffe-Amorim, yet this is how Fernandes characterised the decision not to move to Al-Hilal. In June he said: “I had to wait a while to think about the future. I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on. I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it. I spoke to the club, who said they weren’t willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.”
“If United thought it best to move on” and “Amorim tried to talk me out of it” places the onus on the club not wanting him to depart. There is also a school of thought that despite Fernandes also saying his wife offered no preference either way – leaving the player to decide his future – not uprooting the family was a factor. United might not have cried if Fernandes had swung the other way given the desperately needed windfall that would have swelled the coffers.
Fernandes is United’s best player, by a distance, so Amorim’s wish (backed by Ratcliffe) can be filed as prudent football sense, but United preparing to fly to Stockholm to face Leeds for Saturday’s pre-season opener having signed only Cunha also blares transfer market dysfunction.
This has been an issue since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May 2013. In ordering Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho, Antony and Malacia to keep fit alone, Ratcliffe, Amorim and Ashworth’s successor, Jason Wilcox, flag that all are personae non gratae whom the club are desperate to offload, markedly reducing their market value.
When you possibly need to raise a few more million to land Mbeumo, trumpeting to the industry that five assets can be bought for a bargain is hardly a 4D-chess move.
For Mbeumo, Brentford now want a total of nearer £70m, up from the £65m Ratcliffe and company understood last month would have had him joining Cunha in Amorim’s squad. Ratcliffe is determined not to be pushed into paying over the odds so plays the patience game.
But as the clock ticks you wonder how Amorim feels about the effect on preparation for the campaign. United have no European football for the first time since 2014-15, meaning the head coach will have more days to drill his team in his beloved 3-4-3. But, as he constantly says, the right players are needed to fit this.
After Delap, the number-one centre-forward target, plumped for Chelsea – he is now a world champion – Amorim remains hopeful of signing a No 9. But given United’s position in the market you could forgive the Portuguese being unsure whether Ratcliffe-Wilcox can pull off a deal – or seal Mbeumo’s arrival. To further complicate matters, the goalkeeper André Onana will not be able to play on the US pre-season tour, and perhaps for longer, because of a hamstring injury.
Eriksen also said: “Next season it has to be better and I’m sure it will be.” Ratcliffe and his cohort have to show there is a plan B.

Howe’s dilemma as Newcastle’s Saudi owners can’t ignore case to sell Isak,Liverpool’s record bid for striker and offer for Howe target Ekitike cast cloud over manager’s plans for new season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/newcastle-eddie-howe-alexander-isak-hugo-ekitike-liverpool,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:06:26",Louise Taylor,['Liverpool'],"Amid the jungle of super-skyscrapers dominating Riyadh’s financial district, one building soars above the rest. From the higher floors of the 385-metre PIF Tower, employees can plot their next deal while gazing down on a glass-curtained canopy of concrete, steel and polished marble.
For Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and the chair of Newcastle United, the top of this striking, 80-storey crystalline structure is a place where metaphorical blue-sky thinking meets reality.
The bad news for Eddie Howe is that the business case for selling Alexander Isak to Liverpool this summer is surely far too persuasive for Rumayyan and his colleagues to ignore.
In an ideal world Newcastle’s manager would keep the Sweden centre-forward while acquiring the France Under-21 striker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt before a Champions League campaign. Given that Liverpool, like Newcastle, have made contact with Eintracht over Ekitike and seem determined to acquire the Frenchman or Isak that scenario seems unlikely.
The message from Newcastle – and it is said to originate “right from the very top” in Riyadh – has consistently been that Isak will not be sold this year. Indeed, the word is that Howe wants to deviate from his preferred, winger-heavy 4-3-3 and play Isak and Ekitike in attacking tandem.
But, even before contemplating the reality that insisting something or someone is not for sale at any price is frequently a precursor to driving a hard bargain, that supposed stance begs quite a few questions.
First and foremost why, shortly after Howe and club officials met Isak’s agent, did Newcastle suddenly turn their attention from potential £30m replacements for Isak’s former understudy Callum Wilson to more expensive targets and end up offering Eintracht Frankfurt approaching £70m for Ekitike? Was it really pure coincidence?
And why has there not been any announcement of Isak entering long-mooted summer negotiations to extend a contract that runs until 2028? Even if a player who scored 23 goals in 34 Premier League appearances last season declined to sign, a deal could surely be discussed.
Although Isak is extremely well paid at about £150,000 a week, talks regarding a planned pay increase last summer were postponed as Newcastle struggled to stay on the right side of Premier League spending rules. Much improved terms seem his for the taking now but maybe that moment has passed and Isak would rather move to pastures new.
Newcastle have long suspected that he would decline an extension this summer, and their original plan was to keep him for one more season and sell high in 12 months. But Ekitike’s wages would almost certainly be slightly cheaper and, having just turned 23, he is almost three years younger than Isak. Throw in some stylistic similarities in the pair’s games – for a start both like to drift to the left and suit counterattacking tactics – and the fact that Ekitike is less injury prone and the case for doing a deal with Liverpool becomes ever more persuasive.
Then there’s Howe’s relationship with Richard Hughes. Newcastle’s manager and Liverpool’s sporting director are good friends, stemming from their days together at Bournemouth. Although Liverpool deny making a formal approach for Isak, the fact that intermediaries have subtly made clear that Arne Slot’s board would be prepared to pay about £120m for Howe’s prize possession suggests they have received encouragement, however tacit, from someone, somewhere.
With Paul Mitchell having stepped down as Newcastle’s sporting director this summer and Darren Eales, the chief executive, due to depart on health grounds, Andy Howe, the manager’s nephew, has a key role in recruitment. It may or may not be significant that he also knows Hughes well.
With Darwin Núñez seemingly likely to join Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal or Napoli, Liverpool’s twin interest in Isak and Ekitike means it is near impossible to envisage both players wearing black-and-white stripes next season.
Given PIF’s gargantuan wealth it might all be very different without profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) but those spending regulations have arguably made selling well even more important than buying cleverly.
Newcastle narrowly avoided a PSR breach last June and, even though their financial position is healthier, the club’s commercial revenue streams still have some catching up to do with those of Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.
With Newcastle having paid Nottingham Forest £55m for the Sweden right-winger Anthony Elanga this summer, they cannot spend big without selling smartly. Considering Howe needs a right-sided central defender and a goalkeeper – negotiations with Burnley are inching towards a £30m-plus deal for James Trafford – in addition to replacing the Leeds-bound Sean Longstaff in midfield, something is going to have to give.
Accordingly if Newcastle can sell Isak for almost double the near-£65m they paid Real Sociedad for him it would reflect extremely well on their PSR balance sheet. The attendant financial wriggle room would help fund the purchase of a central striker as cover for Ekitike or whoever joins as the first choice, and maybe even a move for Coventry’s Jack Rudoni, an attacking midfielder much coveted by Howe.
It all leaves the ball firmly in Eintracht’s court. The German club are noted as tough negotiators and hope for more than Ekitike’s £87m release clause. Bundesliga strikers have not always fared overly well in the Premier League but the Frenchman scored 22 goals last season, including 15 in the league to help Eintracht qualify for the Champions League. In 2022 he was Newcastle’s top attacking target, ahead of even Isak. Howe has twice tried, and failed, to buy him.
Liverpool possess the pulling power and financial clout to tempt Ekitike to play for Slot rather than Howe but is Isak the striker Slot really wants?
One thing is clear. If Newcastle cannot sign Ekitike the stack of cards collapses and it becomes impossible to imagine anyone in PIF Tower approving Isak’s sale.

Liverpool make approach to sign Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike,Newcastle failed with £70m offer for Ekitike,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/liverpool-make-approach-eintracht-frankfurt-forward-hugo-ekitike,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 16:40:26",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have made an approach for Hugo Ekitike of Eintracht Frankfurt as their competition with Newcastle over a new striker intensifies.
The Premier League champions have been in the market for a No 9 all summer and have contacted Eintracht over the availability of Ekitike, the subject of a failed £70m offer from Newcastle this week.
Alexander Isak tops the list of targets for Liverpool, who would be prepared to pay a British record fee to secure Newcastle’s centre-forward, but their understanding is the Sweden international is not for sale.
Whether Newcastle’s – or Isak’s – position changes remains to be seen, but Liverpool have several forwards under consideration and could scupper Eddie Howe’s move for Ekitike should they decide there is no prospect of a deal for Isak. The champions will have to act quickly to sign Ekitike if that is the case.
Newcastle remain in talks with Eintracht over the France Under‑21 international, who scored 22 goals and provided 12 assists in all competitions last season, his debut campaign in the Bundesliga.
Liverpool’s interest in the 23‑year‑old not only threatens Newcastle’s chances but improves the German club’s negotiating position. The former Reims and Paris Saint-Germain forward is believed to have a release clause of about €100m (£86.6m) and an auction between two Premier League clubs would encourage them to hold out for the asking price.

Ethan Nwaneri poised to sign new Arsenal deal amid Chelsea and Bundesliga interest,Contract expected to be four years plus one-year option,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/ethan-nwaneri-new-arsenal-contract-chelsea-bundesliga,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 09:41:19",Ed Aarons,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Ethan Nwaneri is poised to commit his future to Arsenal by signing a new contract despite interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany.
Negotiations with Nwaneri’s representatives are understood to be in the final stages, a four-year deal with an option to extend by a year having been agreed in principle. The 18-year-old has entered the final 12 months of his contract and had been linked with Chelsea in recent weeks. Borussia Dortmund were also believed to be keen after his brilliant breakthrough season in which he scored nine goals in 37 appearances.
But Arsenal were always confident that Nwaneri, who joined their academy at the age of eight, would join his fellow teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly in extending his stay. Nwaneri was part of the England squad that won the European Under-21 Championship in Slovakia and was given an extended break but will be part of the squad that flies to Singapore on Saturday for Arsenal’s pre-season tour of Asia.
Nwaneri could be joined by Cristhian Mosquera after the Spain Under-21 international flew to London on Tuesday to complete his medical. A fee of up to £16.5m has been agreed with Valencia, and Arsenal are also poised to announce the signing Noni Madueke from Chelsea for up to £52m.
Talks with Sporting over bonuses in the Viktor Gyökeres deal that could take the cost of the transfer to about £68m are also nearing a conclusion, with the Sweden striker having agreed personal terms.

Manchester United’s Mbeumo push stalls after Brentford raise price towards £70m,Brentford fail with move for Ipswich’s Omari Hutchinson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/manchester-united-bryan-mbeumo-stalls-brentford-raise-price-70m,"Wed, 16 Jul 2025 11:54:00",Jamie Jackson,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","Manchester United’s efforts to buy Bryan Mbeumo have stalled after Brentford raised their valuation to closer to £70m, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe intent on not being pushed into paying more than his club’s £65m valuation of the forward.
Mbeumo has told Brentford he wants to join United, and at the end of June Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox, United’s director of football, believed a £65m package would land the 25-year-old. Brentford also privately indicated a medical was expected imminently.
The change of stance has been met with resistance by Ratcliffe and Wilcox, who do not wish to be held to ransom and are determined to be patient. Brentford view their position as firm because although Mbeumo’s contract expires next summer the club hold a one-year option.
If Ratcliffe, who oversees football operations at United, and Wilcox decide to raise their offer they may first want money from the sale or loan of one of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia. United claim all have asked to leave, so the club will listen to offers. Ruben Amorim is also targeting a centre-forward. The head coach has signed only Matheus Cunha this summer, for £62.5m from Wolves.
In just over four weeks’ time United host Arsenal in their Premier League opener. United’s pre-season begins with Saturday’s trip to Stockholm’s Strawberry Arena to play Leeds before Amorim’s squad fly to Chicago for a tour of the US, where they play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.
Brentford have failed in an attempt to trigger Omari Hutchinson’s £35m release clause from relegated Ipswich, although that is not expected to end the west London club’s pursuit of the forward.
Hutchinson would have been free to depart Portman Road if the terms of his clause had been met by 5pm on Tuesday. A series of late approaches from Brentford are understood to have been firmed up with an offer shortly before the deadline, but that failed to meet the requirements.
The bid was spread in instalments, with Ipswich instead requiring cash up front. The expiry of the clause gives Ipswich greater control of the 21-year-old’s destiny but their resolve could still be tested if Brentford return with a more palatable payment structure.
Brentford are undergoing a summer revamp under Keith Andrews and are keen on signing Hutchinson, who shone for England in their victorious Uefa Under-21 Championship campaign.
Elsewhere, Bournemouth have completed the £25m signing of the goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea on a five-year deal. The Serbia international said: “I came to Bournemouth because I want to grow and I want to play at the best level. Together with this club, with these facilities, I think we can achieve it.”

Bigger Cup is up and running, baby, as we officially wave goodbye to “last season” and welcome “this season”. The question of when we enter a new campaign is eternally asked; it’s like the quandary of where the north of England starts (anything above Bristol Stoke, if you were wondering), and Football Daily is happy to provide the definitive answer of … roundabout now. Tuesday’s first qualifying round second legs brought the drama Uefa desperately needs to make the competition entertaining before the drudge of matches from September to January. Unfortunately for the suits in Switzerland, almost certainly none of the teams currently playing in the qualifying rounds will reach the league stage but we should let Hamrun Spartans, Lincoln Red Imps and Drita dream … for a bit. At the same time, the prospect of facing Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool and FC Basel is over for another year for the likes of The New Saints, Differdange 03 and Virtus, who will have to wipe away the tears, pull their socks up and go again in Tin Pot.
Permanent Welsh champions TNS went down to a 116th-minute own goal against Macedonia’s Shkendija to lose 2-1 on the night and on aggregate. Football Daily might even have watched it on S4C due to our commitment to the underdog and love of Welsh commentary. “There is one thing everyone can be proud of through the club, it’s that everyone gave everything that they had,” chirped manager Craig Harrison. “No one could give anything more and sometimes that’s all you can ask.” There was greater cruelty for Lithuania’s Zalgaris, who last won a two-legged Big Cup tie in 2000, as they were sent packing by Malta’s mighty Hamrun Spartans 11-10 on penalties after 28 spot-kicks. It is the first time a Maltese side have made it beyond this round, becoming part of football history in the process.
Even in defeat there can be triumph. Andorra’s national team are ranked 173rd in the world, therefore when their best and brightest, Inter Club d’Escaldes, drew Romanian giants FCSB, who won the competition back in the 1986 by beating Barcelona, when they were known as Steaua, no one gave them a chance. Inter Club d’Escaldes obviously lost over two legs because FCSB possess the former Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches and ex-Port Vale man Dennis Politic. Respectfully beaten 3-1 in the Romanian capital, a lesser team would have given up and gone through the motions. But Inter Club could not let down the 509 fans inside the Nou Estadi Encamp and ran out 2-1 winners, exiting by a single-goal margin. The names of Sascha Andreu and Alexandre Llovet will be sung on the streets of Escaldes–Engordany for years to come.
Dynamo Kyiv, Slovan Bratislava and Crvena Zvezda enter in the next round, readying themselves to bring their lesser-known rivals back down to earth and restore the natural order at the top of the second qualifying round tree. Come May, the ending will doubtless be the same given that the biggest clubs win the biggest prizes, but the summer months provide a reminder that football is more than just millionaires battling for trinkets and there is still glory to be had for those other professionals who can say they are Bigger Cup players. The evolution of the football season is well and truly under way.
