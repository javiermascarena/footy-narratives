Thomas Partey: The key questions,"<em>Sky Sports</em> looks at the key questions surrounding the case of Thomas Partey, the former Arsenal player who has been charged over multiple counts of rape and sexual assault.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13393670/thomas-partey-the-key-questions-about-former-arsenal-midfielder-charged-with-five-counts-of-rape-and-one-count-of-sexual-assault,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:15:00",Rob Dorsett,['Arsenal'],"Sky Sports looks at the key questions surrounding the case of Thomas Partey, the former Arsenal player who has been charged over multiple counts of rape and sexual assault.
Thomas Partey was charged on July 4 with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault, against three different women.
Two of those counts of rape are against one complainant, three further counts of rape are against a second complainant, and the sexual assault charge is said to have been committed against a third.
All of the incidents are alleged to have taken place between 2021 and 2022. Partey has denied all of the charges against him.
A statement from Partey's lawyer said: ""Thomas Partey denies all the charges against him. He has fully cooperated with the police and CPS throughout their three-year investigation. He now welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name.""
Partey was first arrested on suspicion of rape three years ago in July 2022. The Metropolitan Police have been carrying out a full investigation since then.
Sky Sports News has discovered that the first report on the case was passed from the police to the Crown Prosecution Service on December 27 2024 - 18 months after Partey was initially arrested.
Following further investigations, an updated file on the case was lodged with the CPS in April. Two months after that, Partey was charged.
Rape cases are some of the most difficult criminal cases to prosecute, and the CPS will only charge someone if they believe there is a ""realistic possibility of conviction"" when all the evidence is placed before a jury.
It was only once the CPS had reviewed the police's evidence against Partey in April that they felt this threshold had been reached, and there was enough information to charge him with the alleged crimes.
Two months ago, Rape Crisis published statistics that showed there were 71,227 cases of rape reported to the police in 2024. The charity believes many more assaults go unreported.
Conviction rates in England and Wales for rape and sexual assault are amongst the lowest for any crime - only 2.7 per cent of those 70,000+ cases ended up with a suspect being charged by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Investigations into sexual crimes can often be long and sensitive processes.
The timing of the charges - less than a week after his contract at Arsenal expired - has been the subject of intense discussion on social media.
There has been no further comment from the Met Police or the CPS, who are prohibited from making any statement once a legal case is ""active"" - and when it is likely to end up in a court case.
But the CPS is, importantly, independent of the police and makes its charging decisions based only on the basis of the evidence it sees. The CPS never alters its timescales to suit a defendant, or to fit in with their employment priorities.
As soon as the CPS is satisfied there is a ""realistic prospect of conviction"", it will bring forth a charge, or set of charges. That is exactly what happened in the case of Partey.
The police can accelerate their investigations for a number of reasons - one of which could, potentially, be because a suspect may have plans to leave the country in the future, and they feel it could be difficult to get the individual to return to the UK to face future charges.
But there is no suggestion that is the case with Partey, even though the Ghana international is now free to join any other club worldwide, following the expiration of his Arsenal contract.
Under UK law, the alleged victims of sexual crimes are entitled to lifetime anonymity under the law: they cannot be identified at any stage - even if the person accused is ultimately found not guilty.
By contrast, people who are arrested and accused of sexual crimes are not granted anonymity.
However, in February 2022, the UK Supreme Court ruled definitively that a person who is under criminal investigation has a reasonable expectation of privacy prior to a charge.
That led to a huge change in how the media reported high-profile individuals who were being investigated by the police, for fear that the newspaper or broadcaster might be sued for breaching that individual's privacy.
And so, while the accusations against Partey were well known and being discussed openly on social media, Sky Sports News - like other established broadcasters and news organisations - were not able to do so.
That led to a bizarre situation where some opposing fans could be heard inside stadiums taunting Partey during Arsenal games with references to his police investigation, even though he could not be named in the media.
Once he was charged, the media was allowed to identify Partey at that point without risk of reprisals, and report what he has been accused of.
This is a key question, and ultimately, it is a decision only Arsenal can answer. They have not done so, yet.
As Partey's employer, the club had a duty of care over him and an obligation to treat him fairly - everyone in this country is considered innocent unless they are proven guilty in a court of law.
But the club also had a duty of care over other employees, and sometimes in law - the rights of one party can conflict with the rights of another.
Sky Sports News has been told Arsenal did follow the legal advice they had been given from the time Partey was first arrested - which included making sure adequate safeguarding procedures were in place to reassure other Arsenal members of staff.
The legal and moral obligations of an employer when it comes to allegations of sexual crimes against an employee, is far from clear cut.
In the case of high-profile individuals, a company (or football club) will weigh up a number of factors before deciding whether to suspend them.
One of the considerations is the club's reputation. How damaging would it be if a player goes on to be convicted of a sexual crime and their club decided not to suspend them until they were legally bound to do so? How would such a decision be viewed by, for example, that club's female fans?
The principle of law is that everyone who is accused of a crime should be treated equally and fairly. Ask yourself this question: if an office worker is arrested on suspicion of rape, should they be treated differently to someone in the public eye - like a pop star or a professional footballer?
The law says no - everyone should be treated the same. But for a football club, the decision whether or not to suspend a player is a much more complicated decision.
Manchester City decided to suspend Benjamin Mendy without pay when he was charged with multiple counts of sexual assault in August 2021.
Mendy was subsequently acquitted of all those charges against him in July 2023, and he then took City to an employment tribunal. Mendy ultimately won £11m in damages from the club, to cover his lost wages for the two years while he was suspended.
If Arsenal had decided to suspend Partey when he was first arrested in 2022 - and if he goes on to be convicted of no crime - the north London club could have faced a huge legal bill stretching into tens of millions of pounds.
Sky Sports News reported in April that Arsenal had opened talks with Partey over a new contract.
When asked if he wanted Partey to stay ahead of Arsenal's final game of the season in May, Mikel Arteta said: ""Yes…he's a really important player for us.""
And in early June, when Arsenal announced their retained list, the club confirmed they were still in talks with Partey over a possible new deal.
There has been no comment from Arsenal on why they were negotiating with Partey while he was still under criminal investigation.
Now that Partey has been charged, there is very little that Arsenal can publicly say. An Arsenal spokesperson said: ""The player's contract ended on June 30. Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case.""
The Football Association and the Premier League declined to comment.
Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy, who is leading the investigation for the Met Police, said: ""Our priority remains providing support to the women who have come forward.
""We would ask anyone who has been impacted by this case, or anyone who has information, to speak with our team. You can contact detectives about this investigation by emailing CIT@met.police.uk""
Partey is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday August 5 to answer the six charges against him. It will probably be 2026 before his case could be heard in a full court trial.
In the meantime, the 32-year-old is free to continue his playing career, if he can find a new club that wants to sign him on a free transfer - but any future employer will also know he has been charged with six counts of rape and sexual assault.

Madueke dealing with transfer 'noise' amid Arsenal link,"Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca says he doesn't have any doubts about Noni Madueke's frame of mind amid intense transfer ""noise"" linking him to Arsenal.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13393796/noni-madueke-transfer-chelsea-boss-enzo-maresca-has-no-doubts-over-forwards-mindset-despite-noise,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 19:42:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca says he doesn't have any doubts about Noni Madueke's frame of mind amid intense transfer ""noise"" linking him to Arsenal.
Sky Sports News reported this week that the 23-year-old has emerged as a top target for Arsenal and are expecting a bid for the winger from the north London club.
Gearing up for his side's FIFA Club World Cup semi-final against Brazilian side Fluminense, Maresca believes Madueke will have no problems focusing on the task at hand despite the noise.
""[We had] the same noise before the Palmeiras game, and we gave him half an hour and he was very good,"" Maresca told the press.
""I don't have any doubts that if we need Noni, he will help us. I can understand when there is noise around you, it is difficult to deal with that.""
The forward trained as normal with his team-mates ahead of their clash with Fluminense.
Chelsea signed Madueke from PSV Eindhoven for £29m in January 2023, and he has five years left on his contract. However, the Blues have strengthened significantly in attacking areas this summer.
Strikers Liam Delap arrived for £30m from Ipswich Town and Joao Pedro joined from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m.
The club also added Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for an initial fee of £48.5m plus £3.5m in potential add-ons.

From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

"How 'monster' Silva, 40, is inspiring Fluminense","Thiago Silva, 40, will face his former side Chelsea in Tuesday's Club World Cup semi-final. BBC Sport looks at how he defied the odds to reach the top.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c98jn47v1zgo,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:05:26",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"After returning to his beloved Fluminense and helping save them from relegation in December, a 40-year-old Thiago Silva walked the length of the pitch on his knees in an act of gratitude.
On Tuesday, Silva will lead the Brazilian team into a Club World Cup semi-final against his former side Chelsea.
Fluminense have kept three clean sheets with Silva at the heart of their defence this tournament and beat Inter Milan and Al-Hilal to reach this stage.
Silva remains close to Chelsea, where he spent four years of his career, with his two sons Isago and Iago both playing in the club's academy and still living in London.
When asked what he knows about the current Chelsea side, having visited the club's Cobham training ground in both September and December, Silva, said: ""I'm not a spy. I don't know [Enzo] Maresca that well, but I do know a lot of players there. I talk to them practically every week.
""I'm trying to help in the best way possible in terms of information, but we know that in practice it's completely different from everything we studied.
""We just hope to have a perfect day so that we can play the best game possible. I'm happy about this match. It's going to be a special day for me, but it will be even more special if we win.""
Silva's incredible journey
Silva gained his nickname 'O Monstro' - Portuguese for monster - because of his imposing playing style but could easily have earned the moniker through his comeback story.
Growing up in the Campo Grande favelas in Rio de Janeiro and being abandoned by his father at the age of five, the pathway to becoming one of the 21st century's greatest centre-backs has not been straightforward.
A route into European football came for Silva as he left second-tier Juventude to join Porto in 2004, aged 20, beginning in the Portuguese club's B team.
However, during a reserve trip to Thailand, the defender began to feel ill with cold-like symptoms.
In the days that followed, he agreed a loan move to Dynamo Moscow but, after only a handful of sessions, Silva struggled to breathe or perform even basic tasks.
He was hospitalised and diagnosed with tuberculosis. Doctors informed him that if he had waited just two more weeks at home rather than seeking medical help, he could have died.
Silva was stable but not responding to treatment and isolated in a Moscow facility for six months due to the contagious nature of the disease.
He was finally able to return to Portugal and, after a further six months, was cured.
That year out of football was a major setback, in footballing terms, and Silva returned to Brazil, joining Fluminense to rebuild his career.
His return to Europe after two and a half years saw him become one of the world's best at AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, ultimately seeing him earn 113 caps for Brazil.
What he achieved at Chelsea
Chelsea fans still sing about their former defender.
The impact of Silva was enormous on the English club's run to win the Champions League in 2021 which has seen the club participate in this newly expanded Club World Cup.
He also won a Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup - in a previously shorter format - during an impressive spell with the Blues.
Former Chelsea teammate Marc Cucurella, said: ""He's a legend of football, a top player. He's only played for big clubs and texted me before this game saying 'let's go, hopefully we can see you in a couple of days'.
""We have the opportunity to play against him and hopefully we can do good things and win this game and play in the final which is what we want to do.""
Silva says of his journey through west London: ""I am grateful for everything I have been through. Chelsea were a very special team in my life. I won one of the biggest titles of my career there.""
The coach on the pitch for Fluminense
Silva was seen delivering a team talk during a cooling break when Fluminense were leading Inter Milan 1-0 but under heavy pressure.
He was captured by cameras suggesting a tactical switch to a 5-4-1 formation and also recommended putting Everaldo, a striker, on the wing and Jhon Arias, a playmaker, up top.
Manager Renato Gaucho, agreed and Fluminense got one of the best results in their 123-year history as they snatched a late second on the break.
When asked about Silva, Gaucho said: ""I usually say that Thiago is a monster on the pitch.
""He has helped us a lot, he knows European football and Chelsea well. He is essentially a coach on the pitch. His experience is critical - along with his high quality football.
""He talks a lot to his teammates on the pitch, especially in these major matches, against major international teams. His experience and style of play are paramount for us.
""We are ugly ducklings in financial terms but that doesn't mean we can't win the Club World Cup.""
Silva, who is doing his coaching badges, said: ""My exchange with him was important. I think it's normal in football for the coach to be open with his captain. Renato is very open with me. Not all coaches have the humility to understand what the player feels.""

Former Arsenal sporting director Edu joins Forest,Former Arsenal sporting director Edu joins Nottingham Forest in a newly established global head of football role.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c24v698en8vo,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 17:12:58",Adwaidh Rajan,['Arsenal'],"Former Arsenal sporting director Edu has joined Nottingham Forest in a newly established global head of football role.
Forest said the Brazilian will ""oversee all football-related functions, including recruitment, performance, squad strategy and player development"".
Edu, 47, played for Arsenal between 2001 and 2005, winning two Premier League titles, and rejoined them in 2019 as technical director.
He was promoted to sporting director in November 2022 but resigned in November 2024.
""I'm truly excited about this new chapter and honoured by the trust placed in me,"" said Edu.
""This project connects deeply with my values around innovation and long-term planning. I look forward to building a global football model that is competitive, sustainable, and aligned with our president's [Evangelos Marinakis] ambition.""
Forest owner Marinakis also controls Greek team Olympiakos as well as Portuguese club Rio Ave, and confirmed last December that he had been in talks to purchase Brazilian side Vasco da Gama.
Edu, who also played for Valencia and had two spells at Corinthians, joined the latter as director of football in 2011 and served as Brazil national team's general coordinator from 2016 to 2019.
At Arsenal, the former Brazil midfielder played a key role in recruiting manager Mikel Arteta, with the Gunners going on to win the FA Cup during the Spaniard's first season.
While major silverware has eluded them since, Edu was widely credited with helping transform the club into genuine title challengers once again.

Arsenal close in on Gyokeres deal after face-to-face talks,Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta holds face-to-face talks with Sporting in Portugal as the Premier League club move closer towards a deal for striker Viktor Gyokeres.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjrljneqe5zo,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 17:31:04",Sami Mokbel,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta has held face-to-face talks with Sporting in Portugal as the Premier League club move closer towards a deal for striker Viktor Gyokeres.
BBC Sport revealed last Thursday the Gunners had accelerated their interest in the Sweden international as their well-documented search for a new centre-forward reaches a climax.
And well-placed sources have indicated that process saw Berta fly to the Portuguese capital towards the end of last week for key discussions with Sporting counterparts over a deal that could be worth around £70m.
It is unclear if he returned to London over the weekend, but Berta's Portugal trip provides a clear indication towards the level of Arsenal's desire to finalise a deal quickly for Gyokeres.
An agreement over personal terms with the 27-year-old is expected to be a formality.
Meanwhile, Brentford captain Christian Norgaard is due to complete the formalities on his move to the Emirates in the coming days.
The two clubs have agreed a deal worth up to £15m for the Denmark international midfielder.
Arsenal will also decide whether to formalise a move for Chelsea attacker Noni Madueke after agreeing personal terms with the England international.
Chelsea are aware of interest in the versatile winger, 23.

Playing loose with virtue leaves questions for Arsenal to answer over Thomas Partey | Jonathan Liew,There were plenty of legally unproblematic options available to the club before their former midfielder was charged with rape,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/arsenal-football-culture-thomas-partey,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 17:43:33",Jonathan Liew,['Arsenal'],"“We are courageous in the pursuit of progress.”
“We champion our community and each other.”
“We do the right thing (even when no one is looking).”
The values and culture of Arsenal Football Club, as proclaimed on the club’s careers website. Shall we generously call that half a point out of three? Certainly you would struggle to mark Arsenal too highly on courage or intrinsic goodliness right now. But the unhappy case of Thomas Partey illustrates the lengths to which they are willing to go to champion one of their own.
You knew. I knew. Rival fans knew, even if their taunting of Partey was always delivered with the sort of gleeful relish that does not exactly scream concern for the alleged victims of sexual violence. And so of course did the staff and board of Arsenal; knew the man with whom they shared a workplace and a dressing room until last week, knew what he was accused of doing.
Care, compassion and discretion are of course utterly vital at this point. The charging of Partey on 4 July means the accusations against him will finally be heard in court in early August: five counts of rape, and one of sexual assault, involving three separate women between 2021 and 2022. Partey’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire of Hickman and Rose, referred in a statement to her client now “welcoming the opportunity to finally clear his name”.
And it is the word “finally” that stands out here: an acknowledgment of the protracted and often painful three-year process that has brought us to this point, during which Partey was the word English football dared not speak.
Wiltshire, of course, is deeply familiar with such matters. She was also employed by the Manchester City player Benjamin Mendy, who was cleared in 2023 of seven charges of rape, one of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. “She has often achieved positive results for her clients long before the charge stage,” reads her corporate bio. “This has caused her to be much in demand by high‑profile clients seeking a swift and discreet resolution to what, if made public, would be highly damaging allegations.”
All of which is an acknowledgment that there is always a wider consideration to such cases: establishing a verdict and getting to the truth, but also managing the optics and reputations. Partey denies all the charges against him. There is no sense in prejudging the outcome of his case before all the facts come to light. The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are important legal principles in this country.
But the presumption of shining personal virtue is not, and many of Arsenal’s actions over the past three years give the impression of an organisation not simply content to employ Partey, but positively proud of doing so. Who seriously considered – at the urging of coach Mikel Arteta – offering a new contract and extending his stay at the Emirates Stadium beyond last Monday. Who regarded their talented central midfielder not as an alleged rapist but as a man to be lauded and celebrated, perhaps even a kind of victim himself.
Three months after being arrested for the first time, and about a year after Arsenal were first made aware of a rape allegation against him, Partey scored a thumping goal against Tottenham in the north London derby. Afterwards, Arteta said: “For what he’s been through, and the injuries, and the effort that he put in this week, to be available for the team, I’m so happy for him. He deserves it.”
Over the subsequent years Partey would play more than 100 times for Arsenal. His goals would earn them four points in the Premier League; his defensive work probably earned them many more. His collision with Rodri in which the Spaniard injured knee ligaments may well have had a decisive influence on the 2024‑25 title. Meanwhile Arteta would continually lionise Partey’s importance to Arsenal on the pitch, and towards the end of last season reiterated that he wanted Partey to stay.
Obviously it would have been legally complex for Arsenal to terminate Partey’s contract before criminal charges had been laid. But of course there are steps that it is perfectly reasonable for a club to take against a player that do not require an absolute burden of criminal proof. Richly talented footballers such as Mesut Özil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were quietly moved towards the exit for perceived off-field failings. Last year a kit manager called Mark Bonnick was sacked for social media posts he wrote about Israel.
And there were plenty of legally unproblematic options available to Arsenal here that might have offered a certain comfort to the fans now feeling a sense of betrayal at the actions of the club they love. You do not, for example, have to praise him on social media. You do not have to pay tribute to his character or resilience after “what he’s been through”. You do not have to play him 108 times or spend much of June deliberating over whether he is worth a new contract.
Who at the club made these calls and why? Who knew what, when? Who spoke out and who did not? And in supporting him so unconditionally, was it in fact Arsenal who are guilty of prejudging Partey’s case long before a jury would ever get the chance? Arsenal fans deserve answers, but it appears none are forthcoming for now. “Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case,” they said in a statement.
And perhaps in terms of the PR, this is Arsenal’s best strategy right now: say nothing, do nothing, and hope the whole storm passes. There is a new figurehead at the base of midfield, and quite apart from being a better and younger player Martín Zubimendi offers the sensation of renewal, of turning the page, perhaps even a kind of purgation. The women are champions of Europe and will play all their home league games at the Emirates next season. There are always happier, simpler stories to tell, and Arsenal will never get tired of telling those.
Naturally we should be wary of singling out Arsenal here. There is, or should be, no room for tribal triumphalism. Many other clubs would have acted similarly in similar circumstances. In a sense Arsenal’s business-as-usual stance over the past three years is simply one of the defining characteristics of end-stage capitalism, one in which big companies ruthlessly pursue the bottom line while trumpeting their virtue.
We are courageous in the pursuit of progress. We champion our community and each other. We do the right thing (even when no one is looking). This is the moral creed of Arsenal. Their fans are still waiting for them to deliver on it.

Chelsea are favourites for final but they face a familiar foe in Thiago Silva,The 40-year-old has led Fluminense with experience and passion. Could he do the same for Brazil next summer?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/08/thiago-silva-fluminense-chelsea-club-world-cup-brazil-,"Tue, 08 Jul 2025 06:02:01",Club World Cup 2025,['Chelsea'],"And then there was one. Nobody expected a Brazilian club to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals, and if any team was going to make a deep run in the tournament, it was not Fluminense. After winning the Copa Libertadores in 2023, they narrowly avoided relegation last year and have gone through four managers in less than two years.
Thankfully for them, they are now coached by the charismatic Renato Gaúcho, who told us earlier in the tournament: “It’s no use having a team of 500 million reais, because football is decided on the field.” Throughout the tournament he has encouraged Brazilians to take pride in what their teams have achieved, despite being written off due to the wealth of the European sides.
He has also told Fluminense fans to be loud and proud as they celebrate going further in the tournament than their Rio rivals Flamengo and Botafogo, and São Paulo giants Palmeiras. “I ask the fans to wear the Fluminense shirt all over Brazil. Going to the beach, walking the dog, heading to the mall. Wherever you go, I ask Fluminense fans to wear the club’s shirt. Everyone should be very proud of what this group is doing here,” he said after their 2-1 win against Al-Hilal in the quarter-finals.
Renato, a Brazilian football legend who enjoyed something akin to rockstar celebrity status in the 1980s and 1990s, has not always been respected as a manager given his notorious love of the night. Globoesporte journalist Carlos Eduardo Mansur explains that his reputation during his playing days left many people “doubting if he could be a manager with authority because he had fame as someone who liked the good life”.
Despite tasting some success by taking Fluminense to the Copa Libertadores final in 2008, he looked as though he might end up being what is known in Brazil as a “manager of the market” – one who continually changes clubs and rides the country’s never-ending managerial merry-go-round “because no one thought he actually took his profession seriously and would study football”.
When Brazil were dismantled 7-1 by Germany at the World Cup in 2014, the Brazilian football association set up courses for its coaches. Renato mocked the idea of studying, preferring to play foot-volley and indulging in his love of hot sand and cold beer on the beach. “Those who need to learn have to study; those who don’t can take a holiday on the beach no problem,” he quipped. His nonchalance did not do much for his reputation. “There was a desire in Brazil for better training for coaches, especially in the crisis that arose after the World Cup,” says Mansur.
Though Renato won the Copa Libertadores with Grêmio in 2017, he bounced from one job to the next without winning many trophies. Somewhere along the line, though, he seems to have changed. “Those who live alongside Renato today say he watches football compulsively, very dedicatedly – that he is super interested,” says Mansur.
His dedication has even annoyed his family. He’s said to have angered his daughter by turning down a dinner invitation in Miami after Fluminense drew with Mamelodi Sundowns and booked their place in the knockout stages. Renato gave his players free time to spend with their families, but he opted to stay in and analyse possible last-16 opponents instead. “They think I don’t study, but what I understand most is tactics,” he said after his team’s landmark win against Inter in the last 16.
Renato’s teams have always enjoyed the attacking side of the game but the surprise at this tournament is just how well they have coped defensively. “He was never one to lock many players into a system,” says Mansur. “He gave a lot of freedom to the forwards, to the most technical and skilful players. The Grêmio team that won the Libertadores had a lot in this aspect, but defensively it lacked a bit of structure. In this tournament, though, Fluminense are adapting against strong opponents and have been defensively very solid. From a tactical point of view, this is the most surprising aspect of the campaign.”
Two players are key to this improvement: their 44-year-old goalkeeper Fábio and 40-year-old defender Thiago Silva, who have limited their opponents to just four goals in five games at the tournament. Silva has shown his leadership abilities throughout. The centre-back took charge during a cooling break against Inter, giving tactical instructions and adapting the team’s formation, helping them to win the game 2-0. Renato’s critics say he showed a lack of authority and ideas by allowing a player to take over, but others have praised him for demonstrating his man-management skills – as a former player himself, he understands when to let his leaders talk.
Renato can be compared to Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti for this approach. “He has a reputation of being a great locker-room leader, a players’ manager,” says Mansur. “He will go to a press conference and criticise his players, saying they lacked attention and commitment, yet there has never been any news of him losing control of the locker room. This is a very interesting trait of his career; he has a lot of leadership.”
Letting Silva talk was definitely the smart move. The defender displayed impressive, seasoned knowledge of the game, which led to Fluminense’s second goal. Silva has also gone viral for an emotional, rousing team talk he delivered before the game against Inter. He tells the story of his stepfather dying while he was in France playing for PSG. He now has to live with the regret of not visiting him in hospital – and he does not want his teammates to look back at their opportunity in front of them with regrets of their own.
“I didn’t go to see him in hospital because I thought he was going to come out,” Thiago tells his teammates almost in tears. “Don’t hold back out there. Do it now. Do what we can do, right now. Don’t put it off, because there’s no time. Enjoy the moment. Joyfully but responsibly.”
Having won trophies in Italy, France and England, Silva is among the best centre-backs of ​h​is generation. He will be 41 in September but Brazilians are coming around to the idea that he could be at heart of their defence under Ancelotti. “He’s been a huge leader for Fluminense. Ignácio and Freytes, who play alongside him in a back three, have improved their performances tremendously. Fluminense had much better defensive numbers in the Brazilian league after he returned to Brazil.
“He has shown a lot of leadership, but there have been some physical issues and injuries and that would be a concern in a tournament as demanding as the World Cup, with possibly seven games in a month if the team goes all the way. But the debate is back on in Brazil. He is performing at a very high level; he is a great leader; he is technically very good; and he imposes himself in duels against high-level attackers who are much younger than him.
Renato is leading the campaign for Silva’s return to the national team. “I never tire of seeing Thiago Silva play,” says his manager. “He is a leader and coach on the field. It is beautiful to see him play, to see him lead the team inside the four lines. It’s a pleasure to work with him. He’s helped us a lot because of his leadership and, in my humble opinion, he’s still a Brazilian national team player.”
The semi-final against Chelsea will be special for Silva. He enjoyed four successful seasons at Stamford Bridge, especially considering his advanced years in such a demanding league, and he won the Champions League – a trophy that had eluded him many times at PSG. He also won the Club World Cup, beating Palmeiras in the final in 2021, although winning the expanded tournament with Fluminense – the club where he started his youth career at the age of 14 – would be an achievement on a different level. “One more! There are two left. It’s not over,” he told Renato as they hugged on the pitch after seeing off Al-Hilal.
Once more – as was the case against Dortmund, Inter and perhaps even Al-Hilal, Manchester City’s conquerors – Fluminense go into their next game as underdogs. “If you look at it on paper, Chelsea have invested more money and have more individual stars. But Fluminense have things that can take them through,” says Mansur. “They have a great goalkeeper in great form; they’ve found a way to defend and make the team solid when under pressure; and they have Jhon Arias up front who is one of the candidates for best player of the tournament. Sometimes, in knockout tournaments, that’s enough, so there’s no doubt that Fluminense can continue, but I don’t think they’re the favourites.”

João Pedro makes early mark for Chelsea but Blues forwards must avoid seeing red,"New signing made a bright Club World Cup debut and now eyes Fluminense, one of his former sides, on Tuesday",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/joao-pedro-chelsea-club-world-cup-fluminense,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 19:07:54",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"Estêvão Willian was not the only Brazilian attacker to offer a tantalising glimpse of the future during Chelsea’s win against Palmeiras in the quarter-finals of the Club World Cup. There was also a bright cameo from João Pedro, who came on for Liam Delap just after Estêvão’s equaliser early in the second half and proceeded to change the game with his brawn and intelligent link-up play.
It was an eye-catching performance from the forward given that his £60m move to Chelsea had been announced two days earlier. What had the 23‑year‑old been doing during his time off? Lifting logs and existing on a diet of raw steak, presumably. The aggression from João Pedro was startling. He was raring to go after a couple of training sessions with his new teammates and, while he was not involved in the winning goal, his bustling forward play was a vital part of Chelsea reasserting their dominance after Palmeiras pulled the score back to 1-1.
“Even if he was on holiday, he looks sharp, he looks good,” Enzo Maresca said. João Pedro, who was wanted by Newcastle before Chelsea came in for him, did not slack off while waiting for Brighton to sell him. He stayed in shape after going to Rio de Janeiro on holiday.
“I was in Brazil with my friends but I have a personal trainer and I trained, so I was ready,” João Pedro said on Monday. “Imagine if I didn’t train and Chelsea called me to come – then it would be more difficult for me. I made my debut and I think I showed I am ready. In Brazil the Club World Cup is very important because normally the teams there don’t play teams from Europe. I will always take this tournament seriously.”
Such dedication from João Pedro meant Nicolas Jackson was shoved to the margins against Palmeiras. It is possible to read too much into one substitution. Equally it is possible that Maresca’s decision to introduce the newcomer instead of Jackson offered clues about the new hierarchy in Chelsea’s attack. There was already a new contender for a starting role up front after the arrival of Delap from Ipswich for £30m. The 22-year-old has been sharp in the US. He has started the past four games, scoring once, and seems to have moved above Jackson in the pecking order.
With Delap serving a one-game ban after picking up his second booking of the tournament against Palmeiras it is not clear who starts in Tuesday’s semi-final against Fluminense. The pressure on Jackson is rising. Suspended for two games after a reckless red card against Flamengo during the group stage, the Senegal striker watched Delap impress in his absence. More worrying for Jackson, though, is that he was back in the squad against Palmeiras and overlooked when Maresca took Delap off.
Jackson has a lot to prove given that he was also sent off for elbowing Newcastle’s Sven Botman at the end of last season and will still be out when the Premier League campaign starts. The 24-year-old is a handful but immaturity blights his game. A sale cannot be ruled out if Chelsea receive a good offer. They need to generate funds after being fined by Uefa for breaching financial rules.
It makes João Pedro’s instant involvement feel significant. He was signed for his versatility and is a team player. His goal return at Brighton was no more than acceptable – 30 in 70 games – but he was respected for his pressing and link-up play.
It goes back to João Pedro’s spell as a youth player at Fluminense, who switched him from defensive to attacking midfield. Watford brought him to England in 2019 and sold him to Brighton three years later. He will be eager to face his former club. Fluminense have the oldest team at the Club World Cup. Fábio, their goalkeeper, is 44. Thiago Silva, the former Chelsea centre-back, is 40.
Silva spoke fondly of Chelsea here. The veteran may look to exploit his old side’s youth, though. Perhaps Silva will try to get a rise out of Jackson or João Pedro. It is worth noting that Jackson is not the only Chelsea striker with a history of disciplinary issues. Delap puts himself about and picked up 13 yellow cards in all competitions last season. As for João Pedro, he saw red for violent conduct against Brentford in April and could have been sent off against the same opponents after an attempted elbow on Yehor Yarmolyuk last December.
Competitive edge? Maybe, but there was also an altercation with the Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke in training, which led to João Pedro missing the final game of last season. “The people who know me know my character,” João Pedro said. “But when two players want to win, these things happen.”
Maresca needs that aggression to be channelled in the right way. Having three talented young forwards could be seen as a form of insurance policy if they keep getting suspended on rotation but the reality is that Delap, Jackson and João Pedro will not be helping themselves or Chelsea if they keep falling foul of referees.
It is Delap’s turn to sit this one out and watch someone take his place. João Pedro and Jackson will be desperate to put themselves forward before the final on Sunday.

Sporting demand guaranteed €70m as Arsenal close in on Viktor Gyökeres,Personal terms agreed for Sweden forward,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/sporting-holding-out-70m-arsenal-close-in-on-gyokeres,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 17:49:55",David Hytner,['Arsenal'],"Sporting have told Arsenal they want €70m (£60.2m) plus €10m in add-ons for Viktor Gyökeres after rejecting an approach from the London club worth €65m plus €15m. After a standoff that has lasted weeks and driven Gyökeres to distraction, the clubs are in constructive dialogue and close to bringing the saga to an end.
Mikel Arteta has made a new No 9 his priority during a pivotal summer for Arsenal and he has had Gyökeres on his shortlist, together with RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. If the manager has not had the encouragement he might have wanted over Sesko, the picture has been different and more clear-cut on Gyökeres, with Sporting saying they would sell for €80m – less than the value of his €100m buyout clause – and standing by the position.
Gyökeres, who has scored prolifically for Sporting since his £20.5m move from Coventry in the summer of 2023, has been clear he wants to sign for Arsenal. The 27-year-old’s personal terms have been agreed. They were never likely to be an issue; the obstacle has been an agreement between the clubs.
Arteta wants the deal wrapped quickly, ideally before Arsenal depart for their tour of Asia on Saturday week to play Milan, Newcastle and Tottenham. Gyökeres is scheduled to return to pre-season at Sporting on Friday. It has been reported in Portugal that he is unwilling to turn up, such is his determination to force through the move to Arsenal.
Sporting’s record sale is the deal that took Bruno Fernandes to Manchester United in January 2020; the agreement was €55m plus €25m in add-ons. They have been intent on rivalling that with Gyökeres, who has three years to run on his contract.
The Sweden international has been a sensation at Sporting, scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances. He has helped them to back-to-back league titles and, in this past campaign, to the Portuguese Cup.
Arsenal have signed the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga for £5m from Chelsea and the midfielder Martín Zubimendi for £56m from Real Sociedad. They are close to agreeing a deal worth up to £15m for the Brentford midfielder Christian Nørgaard and are weighing up a move for the Chelsea winger Noni Madueke.

‘There is no one like him’: what Martín Zubimendi will bring Arsenal,Midfielder has shown with Real Sociedad and Spain that he combines calm and control with a capacity to tackle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/martin-zubimendi-arsenal-what-he-will-bring-real-soceidad-spain-midfielder,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 08:17:22",Sid Lowe,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","The way Martín Zubimendi remembers it, the day he was given the chance to be a ballboy for Real Sociedad against Manchester United he was more nervous than when he had to play. Standing at the side of the pitch, he found himself transfixed, the game flying by. So transfixed, in fact, that he forgot it was his job to pass the ball to the players and at one point Claudio Bravo, in goal that night at Anoeta, had to come over and take it off him because he was standing there watching. It was the first time it had happened to him; it would also be the last.
If there is anything that defines Arsenal’s new midfielder, it is that he is so calm, so in control. “He oozes assuredness from every pore,” says the Spain coach, Luis de la Fuente. “He doesn’t get nervous walking a tightrope with no safety net.” When he’s out there, games don’t just go by; they usually go where he wants them to. And as for passes, what he forgot to do that night defines him now: there were 1,752 of them in La Liga last season. No midfielder outside Real Madrid or Barcelona played more.
Raised in the San Sebastián neighbourhood of Gros, where he walked his dog daily, quietly heading across the beach or up to Elía which looks out over the bay, Zubimendi was Gipuzkoa chess champion at under-12 level. It fits the way he plays football, which he did even better: thoughtful, strategic, the whole picture. “Martín is a player who will bring us enormous quality and footballing intelligence; he has all the qualities to be a key player for us,” Mikel Arteta said.
Like Arteta, his coach now, Zubimendi played at local club Antiguoko, an extraordinary success story when it comes to football development in the city, before joining Real Sociedad at 12 and making his first team debut eight years later. Last year, his coach Imanol Alguacil said: “There is no one like him.”
Which isn’t, in truth, what most people say. Ask anybody about Zubimendi and one name comes up every time, sometimes two. There is Sergio Busquets, who Zubimendi once joked had done a lot of damage to central midfielders, setting new standards, new demands, forcing them to do things they had never done before. And then, inevitably, there is Xabi Alonso who he says “must get bored of hearing me talk about him”. Alonso too is from Gipuzkoa and began at Antiguoko before joining Real Sociedad. They play in the same position, with the same style, have the same agent, and listening to Zubimendi explain his craft, even sound the same.
Alonso had been Zubimendi’s coach at Real Sociedad’s B team, taking it upon himself to teach him, bringing out the player he could see inside. Even after Zubimendi’s promotion to the first team, Alonso would stop him at the Zubieta training ground and go through the game with him, offering advice. As for being tired of Zubimendi talking about him, forget it. The admiration is mutual, the values shared. This summer, Zubimendi appeared a perfect signing for Real Madrid. Alonso, Zubimendi says, led without it ever being for show; “Martín,” Alonso says, “thinks more about his teammates than himself. He has that ability to generate play, make those around him better, organise. He understands the next step before the ball gets to him.”
He also understands that is not all there is to the game. Not least because he has been told it. He has talked about needing to see beyond the short pass, learning to shift the length of his deliveries, and there is a dynamism about his play that Alonso and Busquets didn’t have. There’s also an ability to do the more traditional duties of a defensive midfielder. Only four defenders in Spain made more tackles than he did last season. If there is one thing that Alguacil is obsessed with it is the intensity with which he thinks the game should be played, the determination to compete and put the boot in if needs be. Zubimendi reckons he might have been the player who most had the manager on his back. “Imanol asks me to talk more, to be more aggressive,” he said. “Your role is to be constantly helping everyone and talking is part of that. That and the challenges.”
Zubimendi is naturally quiet, made in the Gipuzkoan mould. Talk to him and he’s engaging, warm company, the analysis impressive, but there is no show. Everyone in San Sebastián knows him; outside, it is tempting to suggest, too few do. Or at least that, without a lobby to champion him, without any desire to demand the spotlight, he has not always had the recognition his performances deserved.
In fact, when Rodri went off injured in the final of Euro 2024, to be replaced by Zubimendi, it wasn’t only the England fans thinking this was their chance. Up in the directors’ box in Berlin, where the presidents of the regional federations were sat, one of the Basque representatives heard the muttering from the row behind: Rodri going off was a disaster, they were screwed now, Spain were going to lose. The way he recalls it, he turned round and had a go, saying that anyone would think they had never seen Zubimendi play and maybe they should watch someone outside Madrid and Barcelona for once. For a moment, it got a bit tense. By the end of the night Spain were European champions; Zubimendi had dominated the second half.
If they had doubted, De la Fuente had not. “Rodri is the best midfielder in the world,” he had said, “but Zubimendi is the second best. Martín gives you everything you ask for and has a fantastic talent. He’s a guarantee, totally reliable. He always plays calmly, unhurried and every decision is the right one.” Others had seen it too. In 2023, Xavi Hernández tried to persuade Barcelona to sign him. The following summer, Liverpool thought they had him; so did some Real Sociedad players.
At the end of the Euros, Álex Remiro had rented a house in Ibiza and invited the teammates with whom he played for both Real Sociedad and Spain: Robin Le Normand, Mikel Oyarzabal, Mikel Merino, and Zubimendi. Oyarzabal went but, one by one, the problems appeared: Le Normand had to arrange his move to Atlético Madrid, Merino was about to go to Arsenal, and Zubimendi wasn’t sure he was going to make it either, because there were things to sort out. Not you too, Remiro replied, not this year.
Next year, then. Home called and Zubimendi stayed for now but 12 months on it is time. “It’s hard to find the right words to say goodbye; it hasn’t been easy but the moment has come,” he wrote. “Once I had made the decision to go, I was focused on Arsenal because I think their style is the right one for me. [The manager and I] have a lot in common. We come from the same city and played for the same teams.” Starting at Real Sociedad, where one night Zubimendi let the game pass by him but never again.

‘I want to put socks on without being in pain’: Millie Bright on missing Euro 2025,Centre-back is recovering from knee operation,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/millie-bright-rachel-daly-missing-euro-2025-england-lionesses,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 11:35:27",Suzanne Wrack,['Chelsea'],"“There’s more than just England under consideration when it came to that decision,” said Millie Bright on stepping away from the Lionesses ahead of their European title defence. “There’s me being able to walk down the stairs after I’ve played 90 minutes of football, there’s me in the future when I have children being able to walk around properly, being able to bend down and pick up toys, there’s me being able to do normal life things like put on socks without being in pain and, for the first time in a long time, I genuinely didn’t think about the response of the public because that just wasn’t a priority.”
Chelsea’s Bright was discussing her decision to step back from this summer’s Euros for her mental and physical health with the former England international and close friend Rachel Daly. The pair have recently launched a podcast that leans into the chemistry they have as friends.
“For the first time in a long time I’m not thinking about anyone else,” continued Bright. “I’m actually thinking about myself and, to be honest, it sounds savage, I wasn’t really bothered how the public would react. When you’re in the spotlight sometimes you make decisions that are best for the people around you and in this situation it was a decision purely based on what’s best for Millie: what’s best for my mind, what’s best for my mental health and what’s best for my knee. I needed to get that surgery and I have to think about my longevity too and I have to think about competing next season for Chelsea in a jam-packed squad where my position could quite easily be taken away.
“I’m really grateful for the response and everyone that has said how brave it was and that it’s allowed people to take a little bit of confidence for if they need to make that decision,” she said. “As an athlete, first and foremost you are a human, you’re not an object. We’re not indestructible, we do break, our minds break, our bodies break, and I had to make a decision that was best for me in that moment.”
Bright did not feel able to compete at her best and she felt there were others that could. “There were other players that were 100% available mentally and physically,” she said, “and they deserve to be at the tournament over someone that potentially can’t give 50%, let alone 100%. I’m feeling good, though. I feel like I’ve really taken time to just focus on myself and the surgery went well. It was definitely a surgery that was needed, and I feel better in my mind and I’m ready to support the girls.”
Bright’s unavailability for England is temporary. Daly, meanwhile, knows what it is like to step away for good, the Aston Villa forward having retired from international football in April 2024.
“It’s only been a year so I’ve only been away for a small number of international windows, particularly with no major tournament for England last summer, but being able to shut off mentally, having that switch off, but also being able to focus on individual sessions more specific to you with your club, is really refreshing,” she said. “For me though, the most important thing is being able to spend time with my family, being able to do things that I never was able to do during my time as an international player. I can’t take anything away from it, I’m beyond eternally grateful for my career with England, but I think all footballers will say when they know it’s time, they know it’s time, and I was happy to pass on that baton. You see people like Aggie [Beever-Jones] absolutely thriving in there now and it gives me joy to be able to watch her succeed.”
Daly and Bright met around 15 years ago, in an England camp in Spain. They do not remember how they became close friends, it just happened. “We always say that it’s because we’re both from Yorkshire, there’s like a northern soul connection there,” said Daly. “I heard you, you heard me and we were just like: all right, mate, let’s be friends. And then we literally never left each other’s side after that, did we?”
“No,” replied Bright. “We just got on like a house on fire. You know when you just understand someone and they understand you, without having to explain? We just get each other. It’s just simple.” Their joint clothing venture, Daly Brightness, didn’t quite take off but they knew they were on to something with the name, they knew they would do something with it, that there would be a Daly Brightness 2.0, then came the podcast.
“One rule we had was it had to be raw,” said Bright. “Yes, there’s always going to be a football element, that’s how our friendship started, that’s our careers, that’s what we do, but for us the most important side was the rawness of me and Rach as people. We lift trophies, we win, we have these really nice lives, but we still go through a lot of shit and we still go through the highs and lows that every other human being goes through in the world, no matter what walk of life you’re taking,
“I think sometimes the outside world can just think that we live these luxury lives and we’re fine and we should tolerate all the shit that’s thrown at us. But we don’t have armour, my skin is the same as anyone else’s skin, if you cut me I bleed like you, if you say things to me, eventually it’s going to kind of take its toll, so we really wanted to give a glimpse into that side of our lives. That’s the beauty of the podcast: there’s a fun element, there’s a therapy element, there’s a football element, then there’s the questions people ask and it has no filter.”

No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football
It is, ultimately, a way to give something back to fans, something that has become harder and harder to do as the game has grown. In the early days of social media, players could interact there, in the early days of the game’s growth, they could sign every autograph pitchside. Now, crowds are too big to do that and social media is too toxic a place to delve.
“We’ve always been the type of people that want to connect with fans,” Daly said. “It’s very difficult after games to get around all the fans. There is still a high expectation of people in the women’s games that you should stay behind and sign something for every single person. You can’t do that. We haven’t got the capacity to do that. Meanwhile, social media, I absolutely despise it, and I know Millie does too. If we didn’t have to use it for work I don’t think any of us would be using it right now, so it’s nice to be able to engage with fans and give back to them in a different way.”
Is watching the Euros difficult? Is there a fear of missing out? “It hasn’t been difficult for me up to this point,” said Daly. “Now I’m seeing all the Euros hype and it’s bringing back nostalgic memories from when I was there in 2022 and this is the first time where I’ve probably felt a bit like: ‘Oh, I miss that.’ Equally, it’s not coming from a place of envy. I’m just excited to be a fan and watch and see how well they do and obviously wish them all luck in the world. I hope they bring that bloody thing home.”
Bright admitted she feels similarly. “I’m really excited to watch it from a fan’s perspective,” she said. “As players, we never get to experience that. I’ll be honest, I’ve not really been thinking of anything other than just getting back to 100% mentally and physically, but when you start seeing the girls are flying out to Switzerland and all that side of it brings back the memories and you’re like: ‘Oh God, I wish I was there.’ But because I’m so drilled into myself and my mental state and my physical state I’m just really proud to be watching the girls and supporting them.”

Crystal Palace agree deal to sign Croatia international Borna Sosa from Ajax,Idrissa Gana Gueye extends Everton contract,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/transfer-latest-crystal-palace-borna-sosa-ajax,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:32:44",Ed Aarons,['Chelsea'],"Crystal Palace have agreed a deal to sign Borna Sosa from Ajax for about £3m, with the Croatia defender due to have his medical on Monday.
The 27-year-old, who made 20 appearances on loan at Torino last season, is expected to provide competition for Tyrick Mitchell at left wing-back but is also capable of playing on the opposite flank. Palace signed Ben Chilwell on loan in January but he has returned to Chelsea.
Sosa, who helped Croatia to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2022, has three years on his contract at Ajax but has reportedly been told he is not part of the new manager John Heitinga’s plans.
Palace have signed the Argentina goalkeeper Walter Benítez from PSV on a free and are understood to remain in talks with Sporting over a potential £45m move for the Ivory Coast defender Ousmane Diomande. That could depend on the future of Marc Guéhi, with Liverpool believed to be the frontrunners to sign the England defender, whose contract expires next summer.
Idrissa Gana Gueye has extended his Everton career into a seventh season in total after signing a new one-year contract, with the option of a further 12 months. The 35-year-old had an impressive 2024-25 campaign, being voted the club’s player of the season and named the players’ player of the season. Talks on a new deal stalled over the length of the terms – Everton initially proposed one year but the midfielder wanted two – before a compromise was eventually reached.
The Senegal international said: “Last season was a strong one for me personally and I feel ready, fresh, and more driven than ever to keep pushing. With our beautiful new stadium and a real sense of momentum throughout the club, this season feels like a turning point, the chance to build something big and lasting.”
Callum Wilson has left Newcastle after the expiry of his contract. Newcastle had been hoping to agree a new deal with Wilson, reported to be on a pay-as-you-play basis, but the 33-year-old forward said it was “time to say goodbye”. Wilson arrived from Bournemouth in 2020 and scored 49 goals in 130 appearances.
“Thank you for everything,” posted Wilson on Instagram. “I am so proud to have worn the iconic No 9 shirt and to have added a little more history to it. Scoring at the Gallowgate End really is as special as they say. All good things come to an end but there’s no doubt Newcastle United will always have a place in mine and my families’ hearts.”

NEVER. STOPS
Football Daily would prefer not to have to think about Copa Gianni at all but we have a certain professional obligation to do so and have never knowingly been found shirking in the face of our responsibilities. To keep things simple, we prefer to view the tournament as a stand-alone competition that’s taking place between the end of the last season and the beginning of the next one, but the fact that it’s being contested by clubs instead of countries leaves plenty of room for debate. Watching Kingsley Coman “sprint” on to a through-ball from Harry Kane during Bayern Munich’s defeat by PSG as if he was running in knee-deep wet cement, we were presented with the sight of a player in next season’s kit who was quite clearly exhausted by the exertions of the one that may or may not have ended before the tournament in which he was playing started. Does the goal he didn’t score go down in the official xG column of last season, next season, or neither?
If as seems likely, Copa Gianni goes down in the official record books as part of last season, then it will overlap with European football’s next season, which officially starts … on Tuesday! Designed in part by Fifa to disrupt and devalue the gleaming jewel in Uefa’s crown, it will go down as a matter of historical record that last season’s Copa Gianni will conclude at the end of the same week next season’s Bigger Cup began. Over the next two days no fewer than 28 teams will line up to play in Bigger Cup qualifiers, with The New Saints, Shelbourne and Linfield representing Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland respectively. And while it would be little short of a miracle for any of the three sides to make it to Bigger Cup proper, at least one of Shels and Linfield will make it into the next qualifying round because they’ve been paired against each other.
Until very recently managed by Damien Duff, who won the League of Ireland Premier Division with them last season before resigning a couple of weeks ago following a typically forthright but extremely coruscating public take-down of his players, Shels will be managed by Duff’s former assistant turned replacement, Joey O’Brien. “He made his call and then it was up to me to make my call and I did,” said the former Bolton Wanderer of his decision to take over from his pal. “Hopefully we can write new memories again. With the players, we have a great squad. Great lads. That’s why I wanted to hang around.” While fans of both Shels and Linfield had almost certainly hoped for a more exotic Bigger Cup away trip than a two-hour coach trip up and down the M1 to Belfast or Dublin respectively, the good news is that the winners can look forward to an away day in Baku, Azerbaijan. Qarabag await the victors and are a team the Northern Irish side and their manager, David Healy, have faced before in what is now known as Bigger Vase.
Meanwhile in Wales, they’ll be dancing on the streets of The New Saints if the famous side formerly known as Total Network Solutions can see off North Macedonia’s Shkendija to tee up what looks certain to be a second qualifying round tie against FCSB, the even more famous side formerly known as Steaua Bucharest. While TNS are well aware Shkendija is a tough place to go having lost there 5-0 seven years ago, their manager Craig Harrison is hopeful they can exact some revenge. “It’s going to be a really tough game out there,” blathered the former Middlesbrough defender. “It’s going to be really hot and humid and it will be like it was in Montenegro against Decic.” Decic, of course, being the team TNS beat at this stage of Bigger Cup at the start of last season. Unless, of course, it was the end of the season before.

Football transfer rumours: Dominic Calvert-Lewin to Manchester United?,This stuff is going to get interesting soon,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/football-transfer-rumours-dominic-calvert-lewin-to-manchester-united,"Mon, 07 Jul 2025 09:00:24",John Brewin,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","The Arsenal striker mystery may have reached its denouement: who will be unmasked as the man to knock down the ball to an onrushing Declan Rice. The answer appears to be Viktor Gyökeres, who is close to sealing his dream move from Sporting. If Benjamin Sesko is the great, lost Gunner, it’s because RB Leipzig want to charge €100m (around £86m), when Gyökeres will cost £70m and lower wages. Victor Osimhen, another striker in the reckoning, seems likely to convert his loan at Galatasaray to a permanent move, should a £65m fee be paid to Napoli. Yet another candidate, Real Madrid’s rather good Rodrygo, seems poised for a move to Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia.
Chances are that Noni Madueke will be one of Gyokeres’s suppliers as the Arsenal-Chelsea trade route opens up once more. The winger wants Arsenal but Chelsea are open to accepting other bids than the Gunners’ £50m. Also, isn’t he a right winger, where Bukayo Saka plays? Seems Arteta wants a surfeit of players in each position, following the addition of Martín Zubimendi to a packed midfield. Chelsea need to sell £60m of talent to make Champions League regulations after the slapped wrist – and fine – received from Uefa on Friday.
More London-based news: West Ham are willing to sell Mohammed Kudus to Spurs, just not for the £50m they have been offered. That figure seems standard these days, and although Kudus has a release clause of £85m, the Hammers will have to accept less. West Ham need to sell to buy to overhaul a squad that struggled last season.
Some weekend rumours to mop up. Manchester United’s treatment room is to be blessed by the free transfer signing of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who announced his departure from Everton last month. Another possible United signing is Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku, another player with a mixed fitness record. Chelsea will accept a fee of £35m. United are also linked with another Everton alumni: Moise Kean, these days at Fiorentina, and still just 25 years of age.
How will such deals be paid for? Marcus Rashford’s dream move to Barcelona is a possibility but then again, after failing to land Nico Williams, Luis Díaz of Liverpool is Barcelona’s leading target. That’s if the Catalan club can get players registered. United still want Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo. Expect an improved bid soon.
Move off? West Brom winger Mikey ‘Jinky’ Johnston’s move to Flamengo has stalled as fans at the Brazilian club have complained they don’t want him.
