Man Utd agree deal in principle for Sesko with Newcastle set to miss out,"Manchester United have agreed a deal in principle with RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko, who is set to put pen to paper on a five-year deal.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13407644/benjamin-sesko-transfer-news-man-utd-agree-deal-in-principle-for-rb-leipzig-forward-as-newcastle-set-to-miss-out,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:20:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have agreed a deal in principle with RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko, who is set to put pen to paper on a five-year deal.
The deal breaks down to an initial £66.3m (€76.5m) and £7.37m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons.
Sesko arrived in the UK on Thursday night and will have a medical in the next 24 to 48 hours.
Newcastle had been working on a deal for Sesko, and on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, which was higher than Manchester United's - after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.
United are understood to be delighted with the deal they have struck with RB Leipzig. They did not want to get embroiled in a bidding war with Newcastle - and are paying less up front than Newcastle's improved second bid.
The forward's strong desire to join Man Utd has not been lost on club officials - they have consistently said they only want players who want to be part of what they are trying to build, regardless of whether they can offer Champions League football or not.
Director of football Jason Wilcox has played a key role in getting the deal over the line, while director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves have been in Leipzig finalising the deal.
The discussions were professional throughout with RB Leipzig and progressed when Sesko made it very clear he only wanted to join Manchester United.
The 22-year-old was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker, who told his team-mates that he will be leaving, trained indoors away from the team at Leipzig's training complex on Tuesday.
Manchester United's agreement for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.
Newcastle will only let Isak leave St James' Park if they can bring in a ready-made replacement. However, with Sesko now heading to Manchester, it puts any possible move for Isak into doubt.
Liverpool had a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected by the Magpies.
Manchester United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.
It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.
It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.
Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.
What makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?
Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?
And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?

Maddison to undergo surgery after rupturing ACL,Tottenham midfielder James Maddison is to undergo surgery after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13406764/james-maddison-injury-tottenham-hotspur-midfielder-to-undergo-surgery-after-rupturing-acl,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 11:35:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham midfielder James Maddison is to undergo surgery after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee.
The 28-year-old came on as a 75th-minute substitute in Tottenham's pre-season game against Newcastle and was only on the pitch for nine minutes before he started hobbling intensely and appearing in real discomfort.
Maddison looked distraught - with his head in his hands - as he was stretchered off the pitch. It is the same knee that saw the England international miss the end of last season, including Spurs' Europa League final triumph. Maddison was later pictured leaving the stadium on crutches.
After the game, Thomas Frank described Maddison's latest injury as ""brutal"".
And, Spurs released this statement confirming the news: ""We can confirm that James Maddison will undergo surgery for a ruptured Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) in his right knee.
""The 28-year-old midfielder suffered the injury during our pre-season friendly against Newcastle United on Sunday in Seoul.
""His surgery will take place in the coming days and, following that, James will then begin his rehabilitation with our medical team.
""Everyone at Tottenham Hotspur wishes James a full and speedy recovery. We will be supporting him every step of the way.""
Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:
Tottenham were already looking for a new attacking midfielder in this transfer window - this Maddison blow means they need one even more now.
Spurs tried to bring in Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest by activating his £60m release clause. But Evangelos Marinakis' side managed to prevent the deal from happening by first threatening legal action against Tottenham and the player's agent - before then convincing the England international to sign a new contract.
Attacking midfield is also an area where Spurs are short. Dejan Kulusevski is set to miss the start of the season as he recovers from the knee surgery he had in May. Heung Min-Son's attacking spot also needs to be replaced.
Spurs do have a temporary attacking midfield solution in Pape Sarr, who has been scoring from a more advanced position during pre-season, while new £55m signing Mohammed Kudus can play in central areas.
With new boss Frank looking to improve Spurs' ability to compete on multiple fronts, this is not the best start to life in north London.

Liverpool-Palace talking points: Can Slot find balance? Guehi in shop window?,"Premier League champions Liverpool take on FA Cup winners Crystal Palace in the FA Community Shield on Sunday afternoon, with plenty of intriguing talking points around both sides heading into the season's curtain raiser at Wembley&#8230;",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13408178/liverpool-vs-crystal-palace-things-to-look-out-for-as-season-begins-with-fa-community-shield-at-wembley,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 12:38:00",,['Liverpool'],"Premier League champions Liverpool take on FA Cup winners Crystal Palace in the FA Community Shield on Sunday afternoon, with plenty of intriguing talking points around both sides heading into the season's curtain raiser at Wembley…
One thing that jumped out on Liverpool's pre-season tour of Asia and will have worried head coach Arne Slot was just how vulnerable the Premier League champions were to pacy breaks by their opponents.
AC Milan destroyed the Reds and their albeit makeshift back line with three counter-attacking goals in a 4-2 win in Hong Kong, while even Yokohama F. Marinos caused Slot's side issues on the counter.
Slot is still employing the same 4-3-3 formation that saw Liverpool crowned champions last season, however, newly-signed full-backs Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong look set for more attacking roles than Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold in the Dutchman's debut campaign at Anfield.
Given Germany playmaker Florian Wirtz is also in line to be handed a license to roam as the No 10, Ryan Gravenberch's position as the Reds' holding midfielder becomes even more important, with last season's Young Player of the Year likely to be required to help put out plenty of fires in front of the back four.
In fact, Sunday should prove the perfect test of whether Slot has got his team's balance right given just how often, and easily, Palace were able to hurt Man City in this fashion in May's FA Cup final.
Liverpool will travel down south this weekend with questions over whether they, despite having already splashed out almost £300m on new players this summer, still need to enter the transfer market again in order to bring in a defender.
The Reds have injury worries over defenders Joe Gomez and Conor Bradley, who are both in a race against time to feature on Sunday, while Jarell Quansah has joined Bayer Leverkusen in a £35m deal.
That meant the Liverpool boss being forced to utilise the likes of left-back Robertson and even midfielders Trey Nyoni and Wataru Endo as makeshift centre backs during pre-season, which may explain why in their second friendly encounter on Monday, both Athletic Club goals came from set plays.
""Two set-piece goals is not what you want, especially when you face Crystal Palace next week,"" Slot admitted after the Bilbao win. ""It is something to work on.""
The Dutchman does believe, though, that while the club have yet to bring in a replacement for the recently-departed Quansah in the heart of defence, they do still have enough cover at the back for a successful title defence.
""We have enough options left,"" said Slot. ""But it's true that Jarell Quansah left and we haven't replaced him yet.""
Intriguingly, however, one player Slot has reportedly been monitoring to fill that gap at the back is Marc Guehi, who will line up in central defence for Palace on Sunday, giving Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes the perfect chance to run his eye over the England international.
In contrast to central defence, Slot has a range of exciting options to fill the void on the left created by Luis Diaz's departure to Bayern Munich.
Either Cody Gakpo or Wirtz could get the nod at the home of football, while the versatile Hugo Ekitike can also play in that position. Although do not rule out young winger Rio Ngumoha being involved in some capacity.
Ngumoha has so far shone in pre-season, scoring twice and providing two assists in his four appearances, including stunning solo efforts in wins against Yokohama F Marinos and Athletic Club that showed just why Chelsea were so reluctant to see him leave their academy last summer.
Even though the England U17 international is not eligible to sign a professional contract until he turns 17 at the end of this month, Slot has already shown he is not afraid to give youth a chance since taking over at Anfield, with the club keen to leave a pathway for him into the first-team squad.
And if Liverpool are in need of a goal this weekend, then it would be no surprise at all were Slot to turn first to the pacy wide man to make an impact from the bench, especially given how dangerous he has been running at tiring defences this summer, while Wembley's vast open spaces should also be to his liking.
It has been a dramatic few months for Crystal Palace after winning their first FA Cup in May.
They were ultimately demoted to the Conference League from the Europa League due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules and the Community Shield comes in the middle of a pivotal few days.
With their CAS appeal hearing on Friday and verdict expected on Monday, the Eagles' European future remains in limbo as they head into Sunday's game.
And that uncertainty may have had a knock-on effect on transfers. There have only been two incomings - Walter Benitz and Borna Sosa - but by the same token, few big outgoings.
Eberechi Eze and Guehi continue to be subject to transfer speculation, but there have been few concrete movements. Palace have kept the vast majority of their FA Cup-winning squad intact from last season.
So, on the pitch at least, not a whole lot has changed, in stark contrast to their free-spending opponents.
While some may point to continuity - never a bad thing - there is a shadow hanging over Palace at the moment. A Community Shield win would certainly be a pre-season boost, and hopefully spur them on for a successful rest of the month.
Palace have history when it comes to upsetting Liverpool on the big occasion, dating all the way back to their shock FA Cup semi-final win over the then-holders in a seven-goal thriller at Villa Park in 1990, just months after being thrashed 9-0 by the soon-to-be champions at Anfield.
Almost a quarter of a century later, the Eagles were at it again, scoring three times in the final 11 minutes to draw 3-3 with Liverpool at Selhurst Park and all but extinguish Brendan Rodgers' sides hopes of winning that season's Premier League.
Palace also inflicted Jurgen Klopp's first defeat as Liverpool manager when Scott Dann scored a late winner at Anfield in November 2015, before Oliver Glasner's side ended the Reds' title hopes with another surprise 1-0 victory on Merseyside in April 2024.
And the Austrian was just minutes away from reproducing that away masterclass in the final game of last season as the Reds looked to end their title-winning campaign on a high in front of their own fans, only for Mohamed Salah's last-gasp equaliser to deny the visitors a fifth Premier League triumph at Anfield in the last decade.
So do not rule out another upset Eagles win at the home of football this weekend…

Chelsea confirm Colwill surgery after ACL injury,Chelsea&#160;have confirmed defender&#160;Levi Colwill&#160;has undergone successful surgery after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13408351/levi-colwill-injury-news-chelsea-confirm-anterior-cruciate-ligament-surgery-after-defender-suffered-injury,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:50:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have confirmed defender Levi Colwill has undergone successful surgery after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.
The 22-year-old reported back to Cobham for pre-season training on Monday before suffering the setback during training.
A statement from the club read: ""Medical assessments confirmed surgery would be the required course of action.
""Levi will now begin his recovery and be supported by the club's medical department at Cobham during his rehabilitation phase.""
Colwill featured 38 times across all competitions for Chelsea last season before then joining up with England for games against Andorra and Senegal once the 2024/25 campaign had finished.
He played 90 minutes during the 3-1 defeat to Senegal.
Colwill then flew to America for the Club World Cup with Chelsea, playing five games, including a 118-minute outing against Benfica, on their way to lifting the trophy.
The news arrives just hours after Tottenham confirmed James Maddison had ruptured his ACL during their pre-season clash against Newcastle.
Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca was asked about Colwill's injury in a press conference on Thursday and admitted it could force the club into further transfer activity this summer.
Chelsea's latest signing was defender Jorrel Hato from Ajax, while they also have Tosin Adarabioyo, Trevoh Chalobah, Wesley Fofana, Josh Acheampong and Benoit Badiashile to fill the position.
But Maresca did not rule out going into the transfer market to cover for Colwill's injury.
""It depends,"" he said in a press conference on Thursday ahead of the friendly against Bayer Leverkusen on Friday.
""We need to wait and then we'll see. We know each other from last year and you know in our way how important Levi has been.
""I spoke with him yesterday (Wednesday) and I told him if we achieve what we achieved last year, it's also because of him. He was a main player for us.""
Sky Sports' Patrick Rowe:
Jorrel Hato's £35.5m deal could have now arrived at the perfect time. The 19-year-old was primarily signed to provide cover and competition for Marc Cucurella at left-back but could now operate in a more central role to kickstart his Chelsea career.
He's left-footed, strong in possession, athletic and comfortable in progressing the team forward. He played the vast majority of his football as a full-back last season but has played as a centre-back, previously.
It is not the ideal circumstance for Hato and Chelsea but, most importantly, they have an option to turn to. Despite his age, he has over 100 appearances logged for Ajax and has already featured six times for the Netherlands.

Who is most likely to challenge Liverpool this season?,BBC Sport looks at who can challenge Liverpool this season after a summer of big recruitment from several teams.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly6459l03jo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 05:14:55",Emlyn Begley,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool will be confident of defending their Premier League title after a record-breaking summer of recruitment.
The Reds, in their first season under new boss Arne Slot, won the Premier League with four games to spare - finishing 10 points clear of Arsenal.
Slot's side have spent £269m so far this summer - including a club record £100m deal for Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz - which could rise to £116m.
Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike (initial £69m), Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez (£40m) and Leverkusen right-back Jeremie Frimpong (£29.5m) are their other major incomings, while Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has joined in a £25m move agreed last year.
But many of their title rivals have spent big this summer too.
BBC Sport has a look at how last season's top five teams have recruited this summer and if anybody can catch Liverpool.
Arsenal (2nd, 10 points off top)
Selected transfers in: Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad), Noni Madueke and Kepa Arrizabalaga (Chelsea), Christian Norgaard (Brentford), Cristhian Mosquera (Valencia)
Selected transfers out: Kieran Tierney, Jorginho, Thomas Partey, Takehiro Tomiyasu (all released)
Money spent: £201m
BBC Sport reporter Alex Howell: ""This season is an important one for Arsenal and nobody around the club is scared to say it. The players, manager and even the kit launch have all referenced the 'reach new heights' tag - or a version of it - as they look to win a trophy for the first time since 2020.
""The Gunners have spent more than £190m in initial fees as they look to refresh the squad and bring in new players, including the highly anticipated arrival of Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting.
""Mikel Arteta has done an excellent job in transforming Arsenal into repeat contenders in the league and brought consistent Champions League football but now it is time for them to take the next step. This will be a pressured season after coming so close for so many seasons now.
""Arteta looks to have tweaked the way Arsenal are playing, too. During pre-season the Gunners have played the ball through the lines quicker, looking to get the ball forward into areas where they can score goals.
""All of that has been done to complement Gyokeres' style of play and, although it may take time, if it clicks Arsenal are going to come very close again.""
Manchester City (3rd, 13 points off top)
Selected transfers in: Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan), Rayan Cherki (Lyon), Rayan Ait-Nouri (Wolves), James Trafford (Burnley), Sverre Nypan (Rosenborg)
Selected transfers out: Kevin de Bruyne (released), Kyle Walker (Burnley)
Money spent: £154m
BBC Sport reporter Shamoon Hafez: ""Manchester City will be a wounded beast after an undoubtedly disappointing season without winning a major trophy, capped off by a shock exit from the Club World Cup.
""Boss Pep Guardiola has freshened up the squad with five new signings, including re-energising the midfield with the acquisition of Tijjani Reijnders from AC Milan.
""Not since 2017 have City finished third in the Premier League, so there may be a little uncertainty around how they react and how quickly the new blood settles in.
""Champions Liverpool and Arsenal are being talked about as the frontrunners for the title this season so it may suit City to fly under the radar, while all the focus is on the other two challengers.""
Chelsea (4th, 15 points off top)
Selected transfers in: Liam Delap (Ipswich), Joao Pedro (Brighton), Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund), Jorrel Hato (Ajax),
Previously agreed deals gone through this summer: Dario Essugo (Sporting), Estevao Willian (Palmeiras)
Selected transfers out: Kepa Arrizabalaga (Arsenal), Joao Felix (Al-Nassr), Djordje Petrovic (Bournemouth), Mathis Amougou (Strasbourg)
Money spent: £249m
BBC Sport reporter Nizaar Kinsella: ""Chelsea's 3-0 win in the final of the Club World Cup against European champions Paris St-Germain was a statement that they are a force to be reckoned with.
""Manager Enzo Maresca has united a group of players who cost up to £1.4bn, according to the club's own accounts, and although the starting XIs were the youngest ever to play out a Premier League season last year, they appear to be good enough to win titles.
""Among the star players are Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Marc Cucurella but the Blues have also added Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens, Estevao Willian and Jorrel Hato this summer to cope with the increased workload of returning to the Champions League next season.
""Internally, Chelsea have again set a top-four finish in the league as the main target, but defender Levi Colwill is among those who suggest they are ready to win the Premier League or Champions League as early as next season.""
Newcastle (5th, 18 points off top)
Selected transfers in: Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest), Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton, loan)
Selected transfers out: Sean Longstaff (Leeds)
Previously agreed exits gone through this summer: Lloyd Kelly (Juventus)
Money spent: £55m
BBC Sport reporter Ciaran Kelly: ""It is easy to forget that Newcastle United were, technically, still in the race to finish as runners-up with just a couple of games to go last season.
""Newcastle ended up in fifth, but the club had real momentum going into the summer after qualifying for the Champions League and ending the club's long wait for silverware.
""Only this has not proved a transformative window.
""Newcastle have missed out on a host of targets, including Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, James Trafford, Liam Delap and Dean Huijsen.
""The Alexander Isak saga continues to drag on  and there has been further upheaval in the boardroom following the departure of sporting director Paul Mitchell.
""It has been far from ideal.
""Newcastle still have a side capable of going toe-to-toe with the very best, as the Magpies proved against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final, but this thin squad needs urgent reinforcements to fight on four fronts.""

£201m of new forwards - now Man Utd look to solve midfield issue,Manchester United look set to complete a third major forward signing in a bid to solve their goalscoring problems - now attention is turning to the midfield.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4g6rr55ew3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:51:28",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United's agreement to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko for £74m will take their summer spending on their forward line past £200m, but now the question is 'who is going to play in midfield?'
Head coach Ruben Amorim was determined to massively increase his side's goal output having scored just 44 times in the league last season, their worst return since being relegated in 1973-74.
Sesko will be the third attacking arrival this summer after Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, but centre midfield remains an issue for United, with a question mark or two around each of the candidates to play one of those two positions.
And that has led to the club quietly trying to establish what the terms would be to sign Cameroon midfielder Carlos Baleba from Brighton.
BBC Sport looks at the complex issue of United's midfield.
The Ruben Amorim system and Fernandes' new role
Firstly, the non-negotiables.
Amorim's system involves two deeper midfield players, wing-backs who push high up the pitch, two inside forwards and a striker.
It is assumed Sesko will be the striker, with Matheus Cunha playing behind him on the left and Bryan Mbeumo on the right.
That would mean skipper Bruno Fernandes taking on one of the deeper midfield roles.
Now, Fernandes is many things but a box-to-box midfielder is not one of them.
Fernandes likes to roam. He likes to get on the ball. He likes to find pockets of space to take a pass.
But the 30-year-old Portugal international is not someone you would rely on being alert to danger. He is not someone who is going to make a 10-yard run in anticipation of closing down space.
This seems to be a problem even if it was something Amorim dismissed when I asked him on the specific point about his midfield in Chicago a couple of weeks ago.
""Bruno runs a lot,"" he said. ""Maybe in the sprint he's a different player, but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance. He's smart. So it's not about that. Bruno's physicality is not the concern. He's ready for the physicality, playing deep or as a midfielder.""
If that was accurate, why would United be making discreet inquiries on Baleba?
After all, the Brighton player is very much a box-to-box midfielder, someone with energy and endurance, who can tackle and pass. More pertinently, he is precisely the kind of player Amorim does not have in his squad.
Ugarte, Mainoo and Casemiro - but do they have the right partner for Fernandes?
The nearest Amorim has is Manuel Ugarte but the Uruguay midfielder is yet to show he is worth the £50.8m United paid Paris St-Germain for him.
Ugarte remaining on the bench throughout last May's Europa League final defeat by Tottenham told its own story on the 24-year-old's form.
In Atlanta on Sunday, Ugarte was carrying the ball out of his penalty area when he was tackled and lost possession. Everton switfly countered and Idrissa Gueye equalised. That is Ugarte's flaw, he doesn't see danger and allows himself to be challenged in areas of huge danger for his team.
Casemiro is far less likely to do that. The Brazilian has all the experience and nous Amorim needs. He was favoured to play alongside Fernandes in Bilbao.
However, it has been established at 33, Casemiro can no longer get about the pitch as he used to do - and whether he had to do much running in his prime is debatable given he played in a midfield with Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, who were not exactly wasteful in possession.
United do have Kobbie Mainoo. But when he was talking about his squad in the United States recently, Amorim compared the England international's qualities to those of Fernandes. Mainoo's forte is finding space and threatening the opposition goal.
It is noteworthy that in the Euro 2024 final, when Mainoo started, he did so in one of the midfield slots in the same formation Amorim deploys. But the man alongside him was Declan Rice, who is one of the best deep midfield players in the world.
The player in United's squad most suited to the role is 21-year-old Toby Collyer. But it is implausible Collyer could be selected ahead of Casemiro for instance on a regular basis and in any case, the former Brighton academy player is set for a loan move this summer.
Do they need to spend again to solve the problem?
If there is no-one inside the club who can do the job, United have to bring someone in.
However, while it is accepted they could sign Sesko without selling anyone given the next Profit and Sustainability deadline is not until 30 June 2026, United do need to start getting rid of unwanted players - and more signings mean more exits are required.
Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are part of the unwanted ""bomb squad"" who are training alone as the search goes on to find them clubs.
Argentine forward Garnacho is in talks with Chelsea about a move to the London club.
Offloading them all is not straight forward and it is expected that most of those deals will be concluded nearer the September 1 deadline.
And that means United may need to wait for that next signing.
It all brings us back to Baleba. Brighton have made it known they would want a huge fee for the 21-year-old, along the lines of the £115m Chelsea had to commit to sign Moises Caicedo in 2022.
It is not easy to see how United could hit those kinds of figures this summer without more members of Amorim's squad being sold.
But the problem is real so, if not him, who will fill the problematic midfield role?

How McTominay became a Ballon d'Or nominee,BBC Sport looks at how Scott McTominay has become a Ballon d'Or nominee less than a year after leaving Manchester United for Napoli.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crr27dev9zko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 14:32:09",Emlyn Begley,['Manchester United'],"Italian champion. Serie A player of the year. Idolised by one of football's most passionate fanbases. And now a Ballon d'Or nominee.
If the past year has been a dream for Scott McTominay he would not want to wake up.
The 28-year-old Napoli and Scotland midfielder's place on the 30-man shortlist for the world's best player was confirmed 347 days after his last game for Manchester United.
That was as a substitute. Away to Brighton. In a 2-1 defeat.
But while his boyhood club United toiled to a 15th-place finish, McTominay was living the dream in Naples, after moving for a bargain £25.7m fee on 30 August.
He finished the season with 12 league goals, Napoli won the league and McTominay was named Serie A's MVP (most valuable player).
And like something from a film script, it was McTominay's spectacular scissor kick against Cagliari on the last day of the season that sent Napoli on their way to winning the title.
A far cry from the player who would probably have been called solid but unspectacular at Manchester United.
So how has he become one of the top 30 footballers in the world?
Conte turns McTominay into a 'raider'
McTominay has clearly flourished at Napoli. But the change that enabled all this was a tactical decision by Antonio Conte.
At Manchester United he was usually a defensive midfielder - a ""water carrier"", to quote BBC pundit Pat Nevin.
And Scotland even used him at centre-back for a while before Steve Clarke started playing him in an attacking midfield role.
And if it was good enough for Clarke, it was seemingly good enough for Conte.
That choice paid dividends as McTominay scored 12 goals in 34 Serie A games for Napoli, the joint top-scoring midfielder in the league.
By contrast he had only scored 19 goals in 178 Premier League games for United.
In May journalist Vincenzo Credendino told BBC Sport: ""In the system of Conte he's not a builder, he's a raider - the best option while you have a number nine like Romelu Lukaku.""
McTominay ranked near the top for midfielders to touch the ball in the opposition penalty area, and for duels won in Serie A.
Credendino added: ""You can compare McTominay with the big midfielders of Conte's history. In his first years at Juventus - 2011-12 and 2012-13 - Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal scored nine and 10 goals respectively.
""It's not a coincidence. McTominay is perfect for Conte, as Conte is perfect for McTominay.""
Why has McTominay flourished in Naples?
Aside from the football, McTominay - who qualifies for Scotland through his father - is loving life on and off the pitch.
Born in Lancaster in north-west England, he joined Manchester United as a five-year-old.
But last year he decided to stand on his own two feet after 255 appearances for United.
Speaking about living abroad, he told BBC Radio 5 Live recently: ""It gives you more mental strength.
""I've always lived very close to my mum, so I could go whenever I wanted.
""Now I live 1,500 miles away so I can't just go home and see my mum, my family, my sister and my kids so it's different, but in life you sometimes have to take yourself out of your comfort zone and I've always prided myself on that.
""I would never want to be in my comfort zone, and if I can go away anywhere and establish myself and do well, why not? Who's to stop me doing that?""
Having his friend and Scotland team-mate Billy Gilmour helps. The midfielder joined Napoli on the same day as McTominay from Brighton.
""It's different, a totally different way of life over there - the way you eat, the way you live and all that,"" continued McTominay.
""I've been lucky that I have one of my good friends there in Billy Gilmour and he's been great with me. We've helped each other out along the way and drive each other in different things.
""It's been great, and I'm someone in life who just wants to take it head-on. I just want to go out and give it my absolute best - the different culture and language and have a great time.""
Why do Napoli fans love McTominay?
Napoli is a club whose legends are idolised in a way not always seen elsewhere - most notably Diego Maradona.
Last season's success was only the fourth Serie A title in Napoli's history - and McTominay became the face of Conte's revolution.
His image was painted on to a city centre shrine.
San Ciro's restaurant in Edinburgh have a Scotland flag bearing with the words 'Napoli. McTominay. Pizza. In that order.'
Ciro Sartore, who co-owns the restaurant with his brother Santo, said: ""Napoli fans love when a player commits to the city, and him kissing the Napoli badge shows how much the love and appreciation means to him. Obviously, scoring a lot of goals helps too.""
Fans got tattoos of him, with one on a supporter's leg - using his nickname McFratm (basically McBro) - went viral.
Before they settled on that one - and he says it is his favourite - he was also called McTerminator, MacGyver and apribottiglie (the bottle opener).
""The people in Naples are incredible,"" said McTominay recently.
""They're so passionate and everywhere you go there are people who say 'Forza Napoli' and they want to speak to you and have a conversation. That inspires you every time you go on the pitch because they care.
""Every time we go on the pitch it's inspiring and we want to push ourselves to go out and win.""
Journalist Credendino added: ""He is the symbol of the attitude of this Napoli, with his intensity and sacrifice in every game.""

Mayor floats forcing land sale for Man Utd stadium,"Andy Burnham says compulsory purchase powers could be used to secure land for the stadium ""if needed"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39dxdvkepro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 08 Aug 2025 05:16:23",,['Manchester United'],"Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has said he would be prepared to force the sale of land needed for a major redevelopment of the Old Trafford stadium.
Burnham has been supportive of Manchester United's plans to demolish its 74,310-capacity stadium in favour of a £2bn 100,000-seat replacement.
However, United would need to buy nearby land which its owners, Freightliner, have valued at £400m - 10 times the club's valuation for it.
Burnham said discussions were in their early stages, but his office would be able to use compulsory purchase powers ""if needed"".
""The Greater Manchester Combined Authority has approved the establishment of a mayoral development corporation (MDC) to oversee a masterplan of the area to facilitate some of the land assembly,"" he told BBC Radio Manchester.
""But there's plenty that can be done if an agreement cannot be reached.
""The real action is only going to get going in the autumn with the MDC,"" he added.
Manchester United has said the entire project has the potential to create 92,000 new jobs, will involve the construction of 17,000 homes, and bring an additional 1.8 million visitors to the area annually.
It add that the project will be worth an additional £7.3bn per year to the UK economy.
Freightliner has said it is open to moving operations out to ILP North, a new depot planned for the border of Warrington, St Helens, and Wigan 17 miles away.

Chelsea in talks to sign Man Utd winger Garnacho,Chelsea are in talks with Manchester United over signing Argentina winger Alejandro Garnacho.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg373nz30eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 16:40:12",Simon Stone,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","Chelsea are in talks with Manchester United over signing Argentina winger Alejandro Garnacho.
The 21-year-old has been told to find a new club as United head coach Ruben Amorim believes he wants a new challenge.
Garnacho came close to joining Chelsea in January, with the player convinced a transfer would be agreed.
The deal was not completed but the feeling has persisted that the player would eventually end up at Stamford Bridge.
A line of communication has been left open throughout the summer but there is now more focus around the talks, although there is no agreement on a transfer just yet.
As a 'home-grown' player, the fee United could generate for Garnacho, who joined the club from Atletico Madrid as a 16-year-old, would be important from a profit and sustainability perspective.
But it remains to be seen how close United can get to the £60m they initially wanted for him at the start of the summer.
Amorim was criticised for telling Garnacho he should find somewhere else to play immediately after the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May.
Although Garnacho did go on the club's post-season tour of Asia, he cut a detatched and unhappy figure.
He was not selected for the recent three-match trip to the United States, having initially been told to delay his return for pre-season training in the hope of a deal being concluded.
When that did not happen, Garnacho was ordered to train at different times to Amorim's squad, along with fellow outcasts Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford, who subsequently joined Barcelona on loan.
Asked about Garnacho in Chicago last week, Amorim said: ""You can see he is talented, he's a really talented boy. But sometimes things don't work out.
""You cannot explain specifically what it is but I have the feeling it's clear Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership.
""I can understand that. It is not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and have a connection, other times you want a new challenge. It's a natural thing in football.""

Chelsea's Colwill set to miss most of season after surgery,Chelsea defender Levi Colwill has surgery on a serious knee injury and is expected to miss most of the season.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp37qdvd3gko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:50:53",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea defender Levi Colwill has had surgery on a serious knee injury and is expected to miss most of the season.
The 22-year-old sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during his first training session after the Club World Cup on Tuesday, and has since had a scan and operation.
ACL injuries typically rule players out for between six and nine months.
Colwill was a near ever-present for Chelsea last season in the Premier League, starting 35 of their 38 matches as they qualified for the Champions League.
The England international also played a major role as a substitute in the Conference League final and during the Club World Cup, as Chelsea won their first two major trophies under the current ownership.
When asked if Chelsea needed to sign another defender to replace Colwill at his media conference before friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan, Maresca said: ""It depends - we will wait and see.
""You know in our way, how important Levi has been. I spoke with him yesterday and I told him that if we achieve what we achieved last year, it is also because of him - and he was a main player for us.""
Chelsea's alternative defensive options are new signing Jorrel Hato, Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Trevoh Chalobah and Josh Acheampong.

Al-Hilal agree £46m deal for Liverpool's Nunez,Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal reach an agreement to sign Liverpool and Uruguay striker Darwin Nunez for 53m euros (£46.3m).,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz60d2nn5z8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 09:11:48",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Al-Hilal have reached an agreement to sign Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez for 53m euros (£46.3m)
Nunez is now expected to have a medical before his move to the Saudi Pro League.
The 26-year-old Uruguay forward joined in June 2022 from Portuguese side Benfica for an initial fee of £64m.
Nunez has scored 40 goals in 143 appearances but only started eight Premier League games during Liverpool's title-winning campaign last season.
Selling Nunez would financially boost the Reds' chances of signing Newcastle striker Alexander Isak in this transfer window.
The Magpies turned down an opening offer of £110m from Liverpool last week as they value the 25-year-old Sweden forward at about £150m.
Liverpool's busy summer of signings include Germany playmaker Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for a club record £116m plus French forward Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt in a deal worth £79m, pushing their spending past £250m.
The Reds have also sold Colombia winger Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich for £65.5m and midfielder Tyler Morton to Lyon for £15m, while England Under-21s midfielder Harvey Elliott might also leave the club.
Nunez has also been a target for Italian champions Napoli this summer while other European clubs have shown an interest.
In January, Liverpool reportedly rejected a bid worth £61m from Saudi's Al-Nassr.
Nunez managed just seven goals last season, however, he has scored five goals during the club's four pre-season games, including a hat-trick inside 20 minutes against Stoke in July.
Al-Hilal, who are coached by former Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi, finished second in the Saudi Pro League last season.
The Saudi side features former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves, ex-Manchester City full-back Joao Cancelo and former Fulham and Newcastle striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, as well as Senegal centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly and Morocco goalkeeper Yassine Bounou.
Memorable moments but a lack of ruthlessness - Analysis
Darwin Nunez has enjoyed some memorable moments with the Reds, such as January's match-winning late brace at Brentford, but has struggled to make an impact consistently.
He has scored just 25 Premier League goals, underperforming his expected goals total by 8.6. That is the second-worst record of any player over the past three years, with only Dominic Calvert-Lewin below him.
The league's best finishers typically register shot conversion rates of over 20%, but Nunez's percentage of 11.1% ranks only 95th. When it comes to shot accuracy, meaning the proportion of efforts directed on target, he also barely scrapes into the top 100.
There is no lack of volume for the striker, who sits inside the top 10 for both shots and shots on target despite only starting 49 top-flight matches for the Merseysiders.
He has also arguably been unlucky, hitting the woodwork 14 times – the most by any player since 2022-23. But ultimately a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal may have persuaded Liverpool now is the time to cash in on the South American.

Man Utd agree £74m deal for Leipzig striker Sesko,Manchester United agree a deal worth £73.7m with Red Bull Leipzig to sign Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp89dmz39m9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 14:33:34",Sami Mokbel,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have agreed a deal worth £73.7m with RB Leipzig to sign Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko.
The agreement includes a guaranteed payment of £66.3m with the remainder in add-ons.
Sesko will now complete the formalities, including a medical on Friday, before finalising his move to Old Trafford.
The 22-year-old, who was also wanted by Newcastle, has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for the German side.
United have already signed forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer for a combined fee of about £130m.
Those payments have been arranged in a favourable way to allow United to keep spending, while the entirety of Marcus Rashford's £325,000-a-week salary is being covered by his loan move to Barcelona.
United also received £5m from Chelsea after the Blues pulled out of a deal to sign Jadon Sancho.
And United want a further £50m for Argentina winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea and has been told he can leave Old Trafford this summer.
Their main striker from last season, Rasmus Hojlund, has been made available for sale for £40m after scoring just 14 Premier League goals in two seasons.
Sesko's decision to move to Old Trafford is a further blow to Newcastle, who missed out on Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and face seeing their main striker Alexander Isak potentially join him at Anfield.
Since moving to Germany, Sesko is the top scorer currently aged under 23 in all competitions, of players based in Europe's top five leagues - with 39 goals in 87 games.
He is one ahead of Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham and five clear of Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for £100m this summer.
Sesko is big, strong, quick, good in the air and a fine finisher, and has been compared to Erling Haaland - and not just because they both played for RB Salzburg.
He was one of the fastest strikers in the Bundesliga at 35.7km/h - and had the best aerial success rate of strikers involved in at least 60 of them.

The 32-year-old, who signed for Arsenal in a £45m deal from Atletico Madrid in 2020, left the Gunners when his contract expired at the end of June.
Four days later, Partey was charged with five counts of rape against two women and a charge of sexual assault against a third woman.
Partey, who denies the charges, was granted conditional bail on Tuesday at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Under the conditions of the bail, Partey must not contact any of the three women and must notify police of any permanent changes of address or international travel.
In a statement, Villarreal said: ""The club is aware that the player is currently involved in legal proceedings in England.
""The player firmly maintains his innocence and denies all charges against him.
""The club respects the fundamental principle of the presumption of innocence and will await the outcome of the judicial process, which will be responsible for clarifying the facts of the case.
""Due to the law in England in relation to the ongoing proceedings the club is unable to comment further.""
The charges against Partey followed an investigation by detectives which started in February 2022.
Nearly 1,000 supporters have signed a petition set up by online content hub the Villarreal Report to protest Partey's signing.
Villarreal's statement added that it ""wishes to clearly reiterate its strong commitment to respect and diversity and firmly condemns any act of violence in all its forms, including gender-based violence, discrimination, racism, xenophobia, or any behaviour that undermines the dignity of individuals"".
Partey, who will join up with his new club on Friday, is due to appear at the Old Bailey on 2 September.
His move follows Villarreal's 3-2 friendly win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.

Maddison to miss majority of season with torn ACL,Tottenham midfielder James Maddison will miss a significant period of the 2025-26 season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament injury.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwy53dzlr8qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 10:33:48",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham midfielder James Maddison has suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury and is expected to miss the majority of the forthcoming season.
Sources have told BBC Sport that Maddison is set to have surgery and will become a long-term absentee as he starts his recovery programme.
The 28-year-old suffered the injury in the pre-season draw against Newcastle in South Korea last weekend.
Manager Thomas Frank confirmed after the match that Maddison had injured the same knee that ruled him out of the Europa League final victory against Manchester United in May.
Since returning from Asia on Monday, Maddison has undergone tests in recent days to ascertain the severity of the injury.
Initial fears were that Maddison had suffered a cruciate ligament injury and those concerns have now been realised.
Maddison, a 2023 signing from Leicester City, scored 12 goals in 45 appearances for Spurs last season.
He has seven England caps, the most recent of which came in 2024.
'Spare a thought for Frank'
Thomas Frank has had time to brace himself for Son Heung-min's departure – but the long-term unavailability of Maddison is extremely unwelcome, to say the least.
Son's farewell match in South Korea earlier this week was marred by the latest knee injury suffered by Maddison.
The anguished expression on his face said it all, and the sympathy lies with him.
But spare a thought for Frank, who in his first season in charge, faces losing two key attacking players.
You'd imagine that Spurs will give big consideration to entering the market for a new attacking midfielder.
Had their move for Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White ended successfully then the requirement to enter the market for offensive reinforcements would be significantly less pressing.
Such attacking quality is hard to come by. Expensive, too.
Mohammed Kudus, signed from West Ham this summer, has played centrally before and could provide an option.
But Spurs will have to do something to replace Maddison's contribution.

Maresca refuses to rule out Jackson leaving Chelsea,Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca refuses to rule out the possibility of Nicolas Jackson leaving Stamford Bridge during the summer transfer window.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyejn8r38yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 10:11:39",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has refused to rule out the possibility of Nicolas Jackson leaving Stamford Bridge during the summer transfer window.
Newcastle are reportedly interested in the 24-year-old forward, after Manchester United hijacked the Magpies' bid to sign striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.
If they are to sell, Chelsea would be targeting a transfer fee of at least double the £32m they paid Villarreal for Jackson in 2023.
When asked whether Jackson could leave Chelsea this summer, Maresca said: ""When the transfer window is open, unfortunately or fortunately, anything can happen. This also involves Nico's situation.
""At the moment we also had two strikers arrive, Joao [Pedro] and Liam [Delap]. So we will see what happens.""
Joao Pedro joined from Brighton during the Club World Cup for an initial £55m and scored three goals in three games, including a strike during the 3-0 win against Paris St-Germain in the final, while Delap joined in a £30m move from Ipswich and also featured in the United States.
Jackson's Club World Cup campaign was affected by his dismissal in the group match win over Flamengo, but Chelsea's valuation of over £65m is benchmarked against the Senegal international's 10 goals and five assists in 30 league games last season, following 14 goals and five assists in 35 games during his maiden season at Stamford Bridge.
Jackson also signed a nine-year contract until 2033 in September 2024.
Concern over Colwill injury
Maresca revealed England defender Levi Colwill, who started 35 of Chelsea's 38 Premier League games last season, picked up an injury in training at the start of the week.
""It was in the first session on Monday, just in the last minutes of the session. He felt something and, as I said, we need to wait and then we see,"" he added.
""We don't know how long he is going to be out.
""I spoke with him yesterday and I told him that if we achieve what we achieved last year, it is also because of him - and he was a main player for us.""
But Wesley Fofana is nearing a return from his hamstring injury and, although he will miss the upcoming friendly matches against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan, he is expected to be back for the opening Premier League match against Crystal Palace on 17 August.

How McTominay became a Ballon d'Or nominee,BBC Sport looks at how Scott McTominay has become a Ballon d'Or nominee less than a year after leaving Manchester United for Napoli.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crr27dev9zko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 07 Aug 2025 14:32:09",Emlyn Begley,['Manchester United'],"Italian champion. Serie A player of the year. Idolised by one of football's most passionate fanbases. And now a Ballon d'Or nominee.
If the past year has been a dream for Scott McTominay he would not want to wake up.
The 28-year-old Napoli and Scotland midfielder's place on the 30-man shortlist for the world's best player was confirmed 347 days after his last game for Manchester United.
That was as a substitute. Away to Brighton. In a 2-1 defeat.
But while his boyhood club United toiled to a 15th-place finish, McTominay was living the dream in Naples, after moving for a bargain £25.7m fee on 30 August.
He finished the season with 12 league goals, Napoli won the league and McTominay was named Serie A's MVP (most valuable player).
And like something from a film script, it was McTominay's spectacular scissor kick against Cagliari on the last day of the season that sent Napoli on their way to winning the title.
A far cry from the player who would probably have been called solid but unspectacular at Manchester United.
So how has he become one of the top 30 footballers in the world?
Conte turns McTominay into a 'raider'
McTominay has clearly flourished at Napoli. But the change that enabled all this was a tactical decision by Antonio Conte.
At Manchester United he was usually a defensive midfielder - a ""water carrier"", to quote BBC pundit Pat Nevin.
And Scotland even used him at centre-back for a while before Steve Clarke started playing him in an attacking midfield role.
And if it was good enough for Clarke, it was seemingly good enough for Conte.
That choice paid dividends as McTominay scored 12 goals in 34 Serie A games for Napoli, the joint top-scoring midfielder in the league.
By contrast he had only scored 19 goals in 178 Premier League games for United.
In May journalist Vincenzo Credendino told BBC Sport: ""In the system of Conte he's not a builder, he's a raider - the best option while you have a number nine like Romelu Lukaku.""
McTominay ranked near the top for midfielders to touch the ball in the opposition penalty area, and for duels won in Serie A.
Credendino added: ""You can compare McTominay with the big midfielders of Conte's history. In his first years at Juventus - 2011-12 and 2012-13 - Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal scored nine and 10 goals respectively.
""It's not a coincidence. McTominay is perfect for Conte, as Conte is perfect for McTominay.""
Why has McTominay flourished in Naples?
Aside from the football, McTominay - who qualifies for Scotland through his father - is loving life on and off the pitch.
Born in Lancaster in north-west England, he joined Manchester United as a five-year-old.
But last year he decided to stand on his own two feet after 255 appearances for United.
Speaking about living abroad, he told BBC Radio 5 Live recently: ""It gives you more mental strength.
""I've always lived very close to my mum, so I could go whenever I wanted.
""Now I live 1,500 miles away so I can't just go home and see my mum, my family, my sister and my kids so it's different, but in life you sometimes have to take yourself out of your comfort zone and I've always prided myself on that.
""I would never want to be in my comfort zone, and if I can go away anywhere and establish myself and do well, why not? Who's to stop me doing that?""
Having his friend and Scotland team-mate Billy Gilmour helps. The midfielder joined Napoli on the same day as McTominay from Brighton.
""It's different, a totally different way of life over there - the way you eat, the way you live and all that,"" continued McTominay.
""I've been lucky that I have one of my good friends there in Billy Gilmour and he's been great with me. We've helped each other out along the way and drive each other in different things.
""It's been great, and I'm someone in life who just wants to take it head-on. I just want to go out and give it my absolute best - the different culture and language and have a great time.""
Why do Napoli fans love McTominay?
Napoli is a club whose legends are idolised in a way not always seen elsewhere - most notably Diego Maradona.
Last season's success was only the fourth Serie A title in Napoli's history - and McTominay became the face of Conte's revolution.
His image was painted on to a city centre shrine.
San Ciro's restaurant in Edinburgh have a Scotland flag bearing with the words 'Napoli. McTominay. Pizza. In that order.'
Ciro Sartore, who co-owns the restaurant with his brother Santo, said: ""Napoli fans love when a player commits to the city, and him kissing the Napoli badge shows how much the love and appreciation means to him. Obviously, scoring a lot of goals helps too.""
Fans got tattoos of him, with one on a supporter's leg - using his nickname McFratm (basically McBro) - went viral.
Before they settled on that one - and he says it is his favourite - he was also called McTerminator, MacGyver and apribottiglie (the bottle opener).
""The people in Naples are incredible,"" said McTominay recently.
""They're so passionate and everywhere you go there are people who say 'Forza Napoli' and they want to speak to you and have a conversation. That inspires you every time you go on the pitch because they care.
""Every time we go on the pitch it's inspiring and we want to push ourselves to go out and win.""
Journalist Credendino added: ""He is the symbol of the attitude of this Napoli, with his intensity and sacrifice in every game.""
