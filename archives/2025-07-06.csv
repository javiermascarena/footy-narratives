Madueke emerging as a top Arsenal target with Chelsea expecting bid,Chelsea are expecting an offer from Arsenal for Noni Madueke.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13392819/noni-madueke-transfer-news-chelsea-expecting-bid-from-arsenal-for-winger,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 16:12:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Chelsea are expecting an offer from Arsenal for Noni Madueke.
Sky Sports News understands the 23-year-old winger is emerging as a top target for Arsenal.
The Gunners have looked at a number of players in the forward positions, including Real Madrid's Rodrygo. It is understood they have kept an eye on Madueke's development. There has not been any club-to-club contact yet.
Arsenal have only added goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are looking to sign a left winger. Madueke, though, played at right wing 33 times for Chelsea during the 2024/25 season and only seven on the left.
Arsenal also have Bukayo Saka and Ethan Nwaneri to fill the right-winger spot.
Following Chelsea's 2-1 quarter-final win against Palmeiras at the Club World Cup on Saturday, head coach Enzo Maresca said that any players in his squad who are unhappy are free to leave.
Madueke came on as a second-half substitute for Christopher Nkunku in Philadelphia and stretched the Palmeiras defence.
Chelsea signed Madueke from PSV Eindhoven for £29m in January 2023 and he has five years left on his contract.
Chelsea have strengthened significantly in attack with strikers Liam Delap arriving for £30m from Ipswich Town and Joao Pedro joining from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m.
The club also added Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for an initial fee of £48.5m plus £3.5m in potential add-ons.

Jota's wife and family joined by Liverpool players for funeral,"Diogo Jota's wife and family were joined by Liverpool players for the funeral of the forward and his brother, Andre Silva, in Portugal following their deaths in a car crash in Spain.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13392534/diogo-jota-funeral-wife-and-family-joined-by-liverpool-players-in-portugal,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 12:00:00",,['Liverpool'],"Diogo Jota's wife and family were joined by Liverpool players for the funeral of the forward and his brother, Andre Silva, in Portugal following their deaths in a car crash in Spain.
The father-of-three, who married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso 11 days before the accident, died alongside his brother after a Lamborghini they were travelling in burst into flames following a suspected tyre blowout in the early hours of Thursday morning.
The coffins of Jota and Silva were carried into Igreja Matriz de Gondomar church in the town of Gondomar near Porto on Saturday morning, followed by mourners.
A church bell tolled and crowds applauded as the brothers' coffins were carried into the church, followed by mourners, some with their arms around each other.
Others seen arriving at the church included Reds head coach Arne Slot, captain Virgil van Dijk and team-mates including Andy Robertson, Conor Bradley, Ryan Gravenberch, Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones, Darwin Nunez and Joe Gomez.
Also at the funeral for the Portugal international were his national team-mates Bruno Fernandes of Manchester United, Ruben Dias and Bernardo Silva of Manchester City, Joao Felix and Renato Veiga of Chelsea, Nelson Semedo from Wolves, Joao Moutinho, Rui Patricio and Ruben Neves, as well as former Liverpool player Fabinho, Porto president Andre Villas-Boas and Portugal manager Roberto Martinez.
Neves served as one of the pallbearers for Jota after flying in from Florida, where he played for Al Hilal in the Club World Cup quarter-final on Friday night.
Some of the players carried wreaths shaped like football shirts as they arrived at the church.
""They are [have been] really sad days, as you can imagine, but today we have shown we are a very large, but close family,"" Martinez told Sky Sports News.
""We are Portugal, and it was essential for us that [with] Andre Silva and Diogo Jota, we are together and we will always be together and their spirit will be with us forever.
""Thank you very much for your messages, for your support and everything that we have received [from] all over the world. It means a lot and today we are all one football family.""
City midfielder Silva also paid tribute to his fellow Portugal international.
""I can't even imagine the pain of the family, of Rute, of the children, of the parents,"" Silva told Portuguese broadcaster TVI.
""I must talk a little about Jota, who was a great friend to all of us.
""His career, although not the most important thing, speaks for itself. His passion, will and determination allowed him to succeed in life and have a brilliant career.
""More important than that, as a person, the memories that remain. Jota will remain in our hearts forever. He will always be present at all breakfasts, lunches, dinners, national team gatherings, PlayStation or card games.
""It is a very tough episode for all of us, because we spent a lot of time together. The memories I have with him are fantastic. These happy memories will remain; he will be present in every victory.
""We were rivals and team-mates for many years. He became a great friend. He was present at my wedding. Unfortunately, I wasn't at his, because I was at the Club World Cup.
""It is a family that will always be with us and that we will try to preserve.""
After the funeral service, the coffins were carried to the cemetery next to the church.
Family and friends gathered for the brothers' wake on Friday, with a queue forming outside the Portuguese chapel.
The brothers' parents attended the Sao Cosme Chapel, the Capela da Ressurreicao, in Gondomar, with Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and Jota's agent also there.
People held service sheets featuring pictures of both brothers, the largest one showing Jota smiling in his Liverpool shirt and making a heart sign with his hands.
Liverpool postponed the return of their players for pre-season following Jota's death and players past and present paid tribute to him and his brother on social media.
A sea of floral tributes had been left outside Anfield, with many Liverpool fans and supporters of other clubs looking to pay their respects.
Flags have been lowered to half-mast at the stadium and all club stores, museums and tours have been closed until Monday, with staff offered wellbeing support.
Jota and Silva were found dead after the car crashed on the A-52 in Palacios de Sanabria near the city of Zamora at 12.40am on Thursday.
Police said they were investigating the possibility that the Lamborghini left the road because of a tyre blowout while overtaking, and a source from the government sub-delegation in Zamora confirmed ""a possible speeding incident"" was being looked at.
Pictures of the aftermath of the crash showed debris scattered along the side of the road including what appeared to be charred parts of the vehicle.
No other vehicles are said to have been involved in the incident.

Talks had been progressing in the US, where both teams had been taking part in the Club World Cup and despite Bayern Munich also being interested, the 20-year-old has moved for an initial fee of £48m plus £3.5m in add-ons.
Dortmund confirmed the transfer had been agreed in Florida on Thursday evening.
The west London club have been looking to strengthen the wide areas following the decision not to take up the option to sign Jadon Sancho permanently.
The England U21 international contributed 12 goals and five assists in 48 games in all competitions for Dortmund last season.
Upon signing for Chelsea, Gittens said: ""It feels great. It's a great feeling to join such a big club as Chelsea.
""I can't wait to learn from everyone in the team and to push myself to the max here. It's an amazing feeling.""
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
It wasn't always thrill-a-minute under Enzo Maresca last season at Chelsea. Far from it. Gittens can add spark to the team's attacking play.
Comparisons with Sancho are inevitable, given their career histories and preferred left-wing role but Gittens' output of dribbles and crosses at around twice the rate of the former Blues loanee illustrates the different approach the new arrival is likely to bring.
In fact, Gittens' mesmeric, high-speed dribbling ability is on another level in terms of frequency compared to what we saw from Pedro Neto and Noni Madueke in the Premier League this past season, too. Gittens has been a livewire in the Bundesliga and the plan will be for him to translate that into Maresca's set-up.
On paper, it should be a good fit. As the passing network for Chelsea last season shows, Maresca likes his players to find the wingers high and wide. From there, Gittens will relish the one-on-one battles with full-backs as he looks to create opportunities to cut inside and shoot on his favoured right foot or go on the outside to cross for England youth-team pal Liam Delap or Nicolas Jackson.
Gittens' top speed of 35.96km/hr was the 16th-fastest clocked in the German top flight last season and the prospect of him stretching defences or igniting counters is an enticing one for Blues fans who have found their side too predictable of late. If Sancho's lack of pace was a criticism aimed at him, it won't be an issue for Gittens.
Like most Chelsea signings, at 20 years old, Gittens has room to improve and experience to add to his game. He is not the finished article. But his unpredictability on the ball will be a welcome addition at Stamford Bridge.

The rise of Gittens - and how he can spark Chelsea attack,"Chelsea have completed the signing of Jamie Gittens and the 20-year-old winger is set to become a Premier League player, but his route there has been a little different.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13380877/jamie-gittens-to-chelsea-from-reading-to-borussia-dortmund-via-man-city-charting-the-rise-of-the-young-winger,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 15:00:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have completed the signing of Jamie Gittens and the 20-year-old winger is set to become a Premier League player, but his route there has been a little different.
In conversation with coaches and team-mates, we analyse the reasons for his rise and what could come next for him at Stamford Bridge...
🔵 Early promise at Reading🟡 Developing at Dortmund🔵 How he fits in at Chelsea
Sky Sports' Nick Wright:
Gittens made his move to Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City, following the same path as Jadon Sancho, a player he now replaces at Chelsea, but the bulk of his formative years were spent at Reading, where those who worked with him remember him fondly.
Speaking to Sky Sports in 2023, one of the club's former academy coaches Rhys Denton explained how they went about nurturing his considerable skill and flair.
""For a wide player, you're looking for somebody who can dominate one-v-one and it was clear that he had those traits in abundance, so we tried to encourage him to play with freedom.
""You want those players to have the confidence and feel free to go again, and again, and again, and Jamie was really relentless with it. He wanted to have the ball, he wanted to travel with it and beat players, but he also had a lens on being productive.
""He wanted to score a goal, he wanted to assist his team-mates, he wanted to be that exciting player who got people out of their chairs.""
Gittens relished the freedom afforded to him at Reading and, after joining Manchester City in 2018, there was further encouragement to express himself when he featured in a series of showcase matches run by London-based youth football organisation FFDTV.
The small-sided games replicated cage football, encouraging the kind of one-v-one qualities that have formed such a big part of Gittens' appeal to Chelsea.
""It was easy to see Jamie was a very unique talent,"" said the organisers. ""A lot of the boys come from playing 11-a-side with their clubs, but it's more difficult to shine in our sessions because they are three-v-three, four-v-four matches and the intensity is very high.
""He was just fearless. Those sessions are about as close as you can get to street or cage football and Jamie thrives off that.""
It was around a year after those showcase games that Gittens made his move to Dortmund, a brave step for a young player which underlined some of his other qualities.
""I think that takes a certain level of maturity,"" said Denton. ""I think it takes an understanding of what the project you see for yourself is and how you see your game developing.
""I can't speak any higher of that. In this day and age, especially at youth level, a lot of people look at the flashy boots and all of the gifts that come with football, but how many of them are really planning? How many are really looking in-depth at what is going to help them have a long career?""
Gittens, Denton said, was completely dedicated to learning and improving his game, even at that young age. ""A year after he had joined Dortmund from City, I caught up with him to do some training at a performance camp in Bristol where I'd been doing some work.
""We spent a lot of time in the car travelling down together and he was just looking at clips of players. Older players like Ronaldinho, right the way through to your Jadon Sanchos.
""He's the type of player who wants to take the best things from the best players and put them into his game in order to make the best of himself.
""That coupled with some brilliant behaviours - making sure he looks after himself, being well-mannered - and you understand the performances and maturity you're seeing from him now.""
Sky Sports' Adam Bate:
When Dortmund signed Gittens from Manchester City at the age of 16, the transfer flew under the radar. But it was part of the club's policy to identify promising young talent that might not see the same pathway to the first team that Dortmund could provide.
""We convinced him to sign,"" said managing director Carsten Cramer. ""We had good proof through the other ones who we signed - and not only the English ones. The younger ones know they will receive minutes, that Dortmund is an excellent platform.""
However, Gittens was so young that there was not quite the same level of hype around him as there had been Sancho. But, as Cramer points out, Dortmund ""gives you the time to develop yourself"" and Gittens has blossomed in his five years in the Ruhr.
Visiting Dortmund late last year, there was a chance to speak to Lars Ricken, the club's managing director of sport, as well as Cramer. ""When we signed him, he was not on Sancho's level but we said, we can develop him to the level of a great player,"" said Ricken.
""I can remember when he was playing with the youth team, we said we needed time until April and then he will be ready for the first team. It was under Marco Rose [in 2022] that he made his debut. Since then, great development, especially this season.""
Gittens had to overcome adversity at Dortmund. Arriving in the midst of a pandemic, a serious injury hampered his first season. ""Even in the last season he never played 90 minutes,"" said Ricken in November. ""Now, he is improving his playing time.""
It was later that day that Gittens underlined Ricken's point by scoring a sensational solo goal to open the scoring against Bayern Munich in Der Klassiker. It was one of a dozen goals for Dortmund this past season, making 48 appearances for the club in total.
Speaking to Felix Nmecha that evening, the Dortmund midfielder who had also been a team-mate of Gittens at Manchester City's academy, he discussed his progression.
""He has grown and developed, also just through more game time,"" Nmecha told Sky Sports. ""He is getting more experience and starting to make the right decisions at the right time. If he keeps going like this he has such a huge future ahead of him.""
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
It wasn't always thrill-a-minute under Enzo Maresca last season at Chelsea. Far from it. But Gittens can add spark to the team's attacking play.
Comparisons with Sancho are inevitable, given their career histories and preferred left-wing role but Gittens' output of dribbles and crosses at around twice the rate of the former Blues loanee illustrates the different approach the new arrival is likely to bring.
In fact, Gittens' mesmeric, high-speed dribbling ability is on another level in terms of frequency to what we've seen from Pedro Neto and Noni Madueke in the Premier League this past season, too. Gittens has been a livewire in the Bundesliga and the plan will be for him to translate that into Maresca's set-up.

Walker completes move to Burnley from Man City,Burnley have completed a deal to sign Manchester City defender Kyle Walker in a deal worth up to &#163;5m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13392549/kyle-walker-transfer-news-burnley-sign-england-defender-from-man-city-in-deal-worth-up-to-5m,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 11:30:00",,['Manchester City'],"Burnley have completed a deal to sign Manchester City defender Kyle Walker in a deal worth up to £5m.
Walker has signed a two-year deal at the newly-promoted Premier League club after he had entered the final year of his Man City contract.
It is understood City could make a £10m saving on the remaining year of Walker's contract.
The experienced Premier League defender becomes Burnley's latest summer signing after the arrivals of Max Weiss, Quilindschy Hartman, Axel Tuanzebe and Loum Tchouana, while loan deals for Bashir Humphreys, Marcus Edwards, Zian Flemming and Jaidon Anthony have also been made permanent.
Burnley boss Scott Parker knows Walker from their playing days at Tottenham from 2011 to 2013, while they were also England team-mates.
Walker spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan, making 16 appearances across all competitions, but the Serie A side did not take up the option to make the deal permanent.
He now departs City following a trophy-laden eight-year stay at the Etihad Stadium, which saw him win 17 trophies with the club, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League as part of their treble success in the 2022/23 campaign.
Walker had started as City's club captain last season, but was not part of Pep Guardiola's squad for this summer's Club World Cup.
Walker said of his move to Burnley: ""I'm delighted to be here. When I spoke to Scott and heard about his plans for next season, it was an opportunity I jumped at.
""He's done an amazing job here, guiding the club back to the Premier League with a 100-point haul, and now we're looking forward, together, at being back in the greatest league in the world.
""Burnley had a tremendous campaign last season, built on an incredible defensive record, and I can't wait to come in and add my experience and quality to what looks an exciting squad.""
Walker began his career with Sheffield United before switching to Tottenham and eventually joined City in a £50m move in 2017, where he has gone on to make 410 English top-flight appearances.
Walker has also been a key cog for England having been capped 96 times.

'Jota was with me' - Trent's tribute after Real Madrid win,"Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold says his former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota ""was there with me"" after helping the Spanish club reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdxlrvl616eo,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 23:39:29",Adwaidh Rajan,['Liverpool'],"Trent Alexander-Arnold says former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota ""was there with me"" after helping Real Madrid reach the Club World Cup semi-finals.
Alexander-Arnold and Jota spent five years together at Liverpool before the England full-back left for Madrid in June.
Jota, aged 28, died in a car crash on Thursday along with his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva. Their joint funeral was held on Saturday in Portugal.
Alexander-Arnold has been featuring for Real Madrid at the Club World Cup in the United States and assisted Fran Garcia's goal in their 3-2 win against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-final in New Jersey.
He said the news of Jota's death had been ""extremely difficult"" to take in.
""I had to try to perform for the team and help them win the game, no matter how difficult it was,"" Alexander-Arnold told DAZN after the game.
""As hard as it was to do it, I had to push myself to focus on what my job and role was. I tried to do it as best as I could, but it was difficult and I am not going to lie about that.
""[Jota] was one of my close friends - and I am sure that's what he would have wanted me to do. I'm sure we would have had a laugh and joke about the assist as well. He was there with me, I am sure.""
Alexander-Arnold said the Portuguese forward was ""someone who lit up the room when he was in it"".
""I shared the dressing room with him for five years - amazing memories on and off the pitch,"" he added.
""It goes without saying he will never be forgotten by anyone. He will live long in all our memories for the amazing man and the player he was.""
Alexander-Arnold said it had been ""very emotional and heartwarming to see the footballing world come together to show their love and support for [Jota], his brother and their family"".
""I've been around him, his brother, his family, his amazing wife, his amazing parents and his amazing children. It's truly, truly heartbreaking to wake up to news like that,"" added the England international.
""It's something you never expect.""
Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe was among the players who paid tribute to Jota on Saturday, with the France forward indicating number 20 after scoring an acrobatic late goal, in recognition of Jota's Liverpool shirt number.
Frenchman Ousmane Dembele also paid a tribute to the Portuguese by copying his Fifa gaming celebration after sealing a 2-0 win for Paris St-Germain against Bayern Munich, which set up a last-four meeting with Real Madrid.

Liverpool players attend funeral for Jota and brother in Portugal,"The community in Gondomar grieves after the deaths of Liverpool star Diogo Jota and his brother, André Silva.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98jdq57dedo,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 13:01:40",,['Liverpool'],"Footballers Diogo Jota and André Silva have been honoured by their family, friends and teammates at a joint funeral in Portugal.
Jota, 28, was laid to rest alongside his brother, Silva, 25, after they died in a car crash on Thursday.
Hundreds of locals and supporters gathered at the Igreja Matriz in Gondomar, where the brothers are from, on Saturday.
The funeral also brought together huge names from across football, including Jota's teammates Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson, who were seen carrying floral tributes into the church ahead of the ceremony.
The service was held in Gondomar, a small Portuguese city near Porto, that has been left reeling after the brothers died.

Jota and Silva died at about 00:30 local time in the Spanish province of Zamora.
It is understood they were on the way to take a ferry and return to Liverpool for  Jota's pre-season training when the accident happened.
The Portugal forward had undergone minor surgery and doctors had advised him against flying.
The accident came just 11 days after Jota married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso, with whom he had three children.
Players from Liverpool FC, who only three months ago were celebrating their Premier League win, arrived at the funeral together.
Watching them walk in line with each other, almost as they do when walking onto the pitch, was an emotional experience.
There was a strong feeling of community, but also a shared sombreness.
Many were visibly upset, with supporters on the other side of the barrier applauding the players. One woman in the crowd shouted towards them as they walked in: ""Força!"" - strength.
Family and close friends walked into the church in complete silence, many of them with their heads bowed down as the church bell rung.
One person in the procession held up a sign with Silva's photograph, which read: ""Para sempre um de nós."" (Forever one of us.)
So much was the brothers' impact on football and their local community that some of the guests had to watch the ceremony from outside of the church, often hugging and comforting one another.
Locals and football fans in the crowd watched silently for most of the service, which went on for about an hour.
Many wore football shirts and carried merchandise from the different teams across Portugal and abroad where Jota and Silva, who played for local club Penafiel, spent some time in.
One of these fans was Antônio Moreira, who set off early in the morning to be one of the first outside the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar where the funeral took place.
""I know I won't be able to go inside, but I wanted to pay my respects,"" he told me from the barrier outside the church.
Antônio later showed me his phone case - a little old, he said - with the emblem of FC Porto.
Antônio recalled fond memories of Jota on the field, as he spent a year playing for the local club, but added that the brothers were so much more than football stars.
""They were good people, from a humble family, people like us.""
This has hit him especially hard, he said, as 40 years ago his family went through a similar tragedy. His aunt, uncle and young cousin died in a car accident three days before Christmas, leaving his other cousin behind.
Jota and Silva may not have been his direct family, he said, but their deaths felt personal.
""This is what I think: losing your parents is hard, really hard. But losing your children is unimaginable,"" he added.
Jota's journey as a player inspired many people here in Gondomar, football fan Fábio Silva told me.
He has kept up with the brothers since they started in the local clubs - and said he had to be here for their final journey.
""Despite the impact they had on football, and even financially, they never let it show,"" he told me, adding the family are well-loved in the town.
""The community is sad, devastated,"" he said.
Having spent some time with them over the years, Fábio said there was only one reason he was here: ""Respect for the brothers, the family.""
Avid football fans Fábio and Rafaela travelled from the nearby town Lordelo to honour Jota and Silva.
Wearing Jota's shirt, Fábio said it was important to him to be here ""for Jota's final day"". Both said it meant a lot to the community that so many people showed up to pay their respects.
They watched the ceremony from outside the church, like hundreds of other fans - which Fábio said was hard. Nodding, Rafaela agreed, but said it was also beautiful.
""This is an example that you need to live life to the max,"" Rafaela said, ""because you never know when will be your last day.""
""Say everything you want to say, and need to say - tomorrow could be too late,"" Fábio added.

Dortmund announced a deal had been agreed on Thursday, with sporting director Sebastien Kehl saying talks with the Premier League side had been ""challenging"" but ultimately his club were ""pleased"" with the outcome.
""Jamie is an outstanding player who has given us a great deal of pleasure,"" he added.
""He now wants to take the next step in his career at Chelsea, and we wish him all the best and much success.""

Chelsea's Madueke agrees personal terms with Arsenal,Chelsea winger Noni Madueke agrees personal terms for a move to Premier League rivals Arsenal.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93kdgnnw2zo,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 21:21:46",Sami Mokbel,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Arsenal have agreed personal terms with Chelsea winger Noni Madueke ahead of a possible move for the England international.
An agreement between the Premier League teams is yet to be reached but 23-year-old Madueke is believed to be open to moving across London should the clubs strike a deal.
Multiple sources are indicating that while there is yet to be a club-to-club agreement with regards to a transfer fee, there is a sense from all parties that a deal is possible.
Chelsea are understood to be aware of Arsenal's interest in Madueke but the Gunners are still to make a formal approach for the attacker.
Madueke is currently part of Chelsea's Club World Cup side and made a substitute appearance in their 2-1 quarter-final win against Palmeiras.
BBC Sport reported Arsenal's interest in Madueke on Thursday, with the winger's ability to operate on either flank a key factor in the north London side's interest.
Arsenal are looking to strengthen their creative options in the summer window with Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze among the other options considered.
The financial outlay attached to an approach for Rodrygo has raised questions over whether the Gunners can execute a successful deal for the Brazil international, nevertheless the club have explored a swoop for the 24-year-old.
Eze, who has a release clause worth a total of £68m, is another player the club have a serious interest in.
Sources have indicated the Eagles will demand the full release fee but it remains to be seen whether their stance softens later in the window.

Teenage left-back whose role model is Marcelo - Leon joins Man Utd,"Diego Leon has completed his move to Manchester United, so what will the 18-year-old bring to Old Trafford?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy08g24xelxo,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 12:39:14",Marcus Alves,['Manchester United'],"'Left-back wanted' was the message in ABC Color, Paraguay's most-read newspaper.
Coach Manolo Jimenez had been left without much of a choice as he prepared his Cerro Porteno side to face Sportivo Ameliano in Paraguay's top flight in early August.
Having lost both senior left-backs through injury, Jimenez was left with a dilemma - play right-back Victor Cabanas in the position or hand 17-year-old novice Diego Leon his senior debut.
Only a few months earlier, Leon was an unknown featuring for Cerro's Under-17 team.
But Jimenez opted to go with the teenager against Ameliano and his boldness was rewarded as the youngster secured a 1-0 win with a powerful header.
He scored again a week later and impressed so much that he was named player of the month by the coaches' association.
""This is what every kid dreams of. I invite you all to dream. I'm a dreamer,"" he said.
That dream has now taken Leon to the 'Theatre of the Dreams', after the deal - which was agreed in January - was completed by Manchester United., external
And, while his first-team breakthrough may not be immediate, there are plenty who believe he can make a huge impact at Old Trafford.
""He's a left-back like no other in the world, the kind that's rare to find,"" said Cerro president Juan Jose Zapag.
There seems little doubt about Leon's potential.
Lightning quick and fearless with the ball at his feet, he caused such an impact with Cerro's first team that Jimenez had to ask European sides to leave him alone, with Arsenal and Manchester City also approaching him.
Ultimately, he was convinced by United's long-term vision and their determination to secure him.
The full-back will now follow in the footsteps of Diego Gavilan, the first Paraguayan to play in the Premier League. Like Leon, he was a Cerro product and left the team for Newcastle United in 2000.
""Things have happened very quickly for him,"" Gavilan, who coached the club's senior and youth teams, told BBC Sport.
""But at 17, there's still plenty for Leon to learn, improve, and refine. It's going to be a massive change for him, moving to a different country, a different continent.
""Going from a country he's used to, with its own ways of life, language and culture, to adapting to the English way of thinking about football. A lot of things, right?
""But I believe United know what they're getting and will give him time to settle in.""
'He has tremendous potential and physical power'
Leon has one immediate plan - and it does not involve a football pitch.
""The first thing he wants to do is build a house for our parents,"" revealed his eldest brother Hernan.
He did not have it easy growing up in a humble family as the youngest of nine siblings in Juan Emilio O'Leary, a small city close to the borders with Brazil and Argentina.
But not even that stopped him from pursuing his dream and packing his things for Cerro Porteno's academy in Paraguay's capital city Asuncion at the age of 12.
""I followed him during his time in the youth ranks at Cerro, back when I worked there as the coach for the Under-19s, Under-20s, Under-23s and later the first team,"" Gavilan recalled.
""He's a kid from the countryside with tremendous potential and great physical power.
""He always stood out in every level he played at and perhaps more importantly he's someone who can also play in various roles.""
Leon spent his formative years as a left winger, so his attacking prowess is perhaps no surprise.
""He plays as a left-back, but he really enjoys getting forward, overlapping from his position to join the attack,"" said Hernan Acuna, Cerro's head of scouting.
""He initially joined the club as a winger, but due to necessity he was used as a left-back.
""His attacking quality, being able to join offensive moves, does sometimes mean he neglects his defensive duties a little.
""However, he is very effective when joining the offensive actions, particularly with his finishing ability.""
Marcelo is Leon's role model
The defender was picked for most of Cerro Porteno's league games this year but played a very limited role in the side's progression to August's Copa Libertadores knockouts - an indication Manchester United are signing potential rather than a finished product.
Leon has benefited from working with Jimenez, a coach who had previously helped nurture talents such as Sergio Ramos, Jesus Navas and Jose Antonio Reyes at Sevilla.
""He was a player in development, but I saw his strength and quality, so I took the chance on him. Physically, he's a powerhouse,"" Jimenez, who now works at Apoel Nicosia in Cyprus, told Madrid newspaper Marca.
Leon has already admitted his role model for the position is former Real Madrid defender Marcelo.
""Diego has natural talent, but a long journey ahead, too. Hopefully, one day we can say he's had a career similar to Marcelo's - or perhaps one like [Patrice] Evra's at United,"" added Jimenez.
Leon's progress will be watched closely both by United fans and by followers of South American football.
""His transfer is quite a unique case because usually players who leave the club are transferred to South American teams before eventually making their way to Europe,"" Acuna said.
""In the past, many teams, particularly from Spain, used to sign players directly from Cerro. Nowadays, we have this situation with Leon, who is signed directly by a Premier League club, just like what happened with Gavilan.
""There's also the case of Miguel Almiron, who first went to Argentina, then to the MLS, and from there to Newcastle. It's been a long time since a player was signed directly from Cerro to a Premier League club.""

Burnley sign Walker from Man City in £5m deal,Burnley sign England defender Kyle Walker from Manchester City for a fee of up to £5m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn5kq5k96vdo,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 10:38:31",Alex Fletcher,['Manchester City'],"Burnley have signed England defender Kyle Walker from Manchester City for a fee of up to £5m.
The right-back completed his medical on Friday and has signed a two-year contract with the Clarets.
The 35-year-old will work again with head coach Scott Parker, with whom he played at Tottenham Hotspur for two seasons.
""I'm delighted to be here,"" Walker told Burnley's website. ""I can't wait to come in and add my experience and quality to what looks an exciting squad.
""When I spoke to Scott and heard about his plans for next season, it was an opportunity I jumped at. He's done an amazing job here, guiding the club back to the Premier League.""
Walker made 15 appearances in the first half of last season for City before joining AC Milan on loan in January, but the Italian club decided not to make his move permanent.
He won 17 trophies during his time at Etihad Stadium and was part of the squad that won the Treble in 2023.
Walker, who started his career at Sheffield United, signed for City in the summer of 2017 for an initial £45m and made 319 appearances for the club.
Burnley were promoted back to the Premier League last season following their relegation in 2024.
The Clarets creatively announced Walker's arrival on X, , externalusing Popstar Lionel Richie's music video for his song 'Hello'.
Walker is their fifth signing of the summer, following the arrival of defender Axel Tuanzebe, left-back Quilindschy Hartman, goalkeeper Max Weiss and French winger Loum Tchaouna.

What Chelsea can expect from £48m winger Gittens,"Chelsea have signed Jamie Gittens, but why have they targeted him and where will he fit in at Stamford Bridge?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd0lxlklmvvo,"Sat, 05 Jul 2025 15:48:06",Emily Salley,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea's prolonged effort to sign Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund was finally rewarded on Saturday as they sealed the England Under-21 winger's arrival for an initial fee of £48.5m.
The 20-year-old Englishman had agreed a seven-year contract with Chelsea in June.
The arrival of Gittens is good news for Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, who has had on-loan Jadon Sancho return to Manchester United this summer and made no secret of the fact a transfer priority for him was to sign a winger.
The Italian has been keen to add competition for Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto and Tyrique George.
Gittens remained the club's first-choice target this transfer window despite the Blues exploring other potential moves after initial bids for him failed before the start of the Club World Cup.
The 20-year-old joins an already well-stocked attacking line-up including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Marc Guiu - who generally play centrally - as well as wingers Neto, Madueke and George.
""It might feel as though Chelsea are almost doing deals just for the sake of it, but there is a specific plan,"" said BBC Sport football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella.
""Gittens will come in as a left winger and replace Jadon Sancho after his loan spell from Manchester United was not made permanent. It's also worth noting Mykhailo Mudryk remains provisionally suspended for a failed drugs test.""
Gittens is another exciting youth prospect that Borussia Dortmund have nurtured into a star player.
Dortmund confirmed a deal had been agreed with Chelsea on Thursday and he becomes the latest signing for the Blues with strong Manchester City links - joining the likes of Delap, Palmer and manager Maresca at Stamford Bridge.
""He can become the next [Jadon] Sancho, Erling Haaland or [Jude] Bellingham,"" former Dortmund striker Karl-Heinz Riedle said in November.
But will Gittens live up to those expectations and where will he fit in at Stamford Bridge?
'Gittens has been a long-term target for Chelsea'
It is not Gittens' first spell at Chelsea.
He spent a brief period on the books at the Blues' academy before turning them down to continue his development at his hometown club Reading.
After a two-year stint in Manchester City's youth set-up Gittens made the move to Borussia Dortmund in 2020, making his senior debut two years later.
He caught the attention of several clubs after a breakthrough 2024-25 season in which he scored eight goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances.
""He has no fear. For me, he is one of the best players one-against-one I have ever seen, to be honest. He will be a really good player,"" said Dortmund winger Karim Adeyemi.
Despite a strong start to last season, Gittens fell out of favour at Dortmund after the arrival of new manager Niko Kovac in February.
""Gittens has been a long-term target for Chelsea. They were looking at him in January, but that wasn't seen as viable,"" Kinsella added.
But the move became possible once it became apparent the winger did not fit into Kovac's preferred 3-5-2 formation.
Where Gittens will play at Chelsea
A rapid, right-footed left winger, Gittens' arrival fills the void left by Sancho's departure after Chelsea opted not to sign him on a permanent basis.
Speaking earlier in the summer, Maresca said: ""Jadon is not with us so for sure that is a position we need to do something.
""We have Noni, Pedro and Ty only as the proper wingers so something for sure is going to happen. When the transfer window is open, for sure, we can do something.""
He also fits the recruitment profile set by co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart - a young and adaptable winger on a long-term contract, with a potentially high resale value.
""They are looking to get more than one option in every position as the squad will need to be stronger because of the Champions League pressures,"" Kinsella added.
""The squad will be quite well balanced now. The question is will Gittens and Delap hit the round running? They are still young players, so there are question marks.""
Palmer, Romeo Lavia and summer signing from Ipswich Delap were all part of City's Under-21s when Maresca was in charge, while Tosin Adarabioyo is another to have come through that academy.
Chelsea boss Maresca is also an admirer of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who failed to break through at City, while the club tried to sign City full-back Nico O'Reilly in January.
""Gittens is a young English player with that Manchester City link again, so he can play that style of football,"" Kinsella said.
""He also has a relationship with some of the recruiters, there are a lot of ex-Manchester City staff who know him and have had success with signing former City players.""
How can Chelsea afford to keep spending?
Chelsea have already assembled a big squad, with a value heading north of £1.4bn.
Delap and Brighton forward Pedro have already signed during this close season, while midfielders Kendry Paez and Essugo, winger Estevao Willian, goalkeeper Mike Penders and defender Sarr complete their moves this summer.
By buying younger players on lower wages and spreading the payments over long-term contracts, Chelsea's strategy is to unearth new stars and sell on unwanted talent for a profit.
But further additions may be determined by the Premier League's response to the sale of their women's team to parent company BlueCo for £198.7m - a process that put the wider business into profit.
""If this is accepted by the Premier League, then Chelsea would have significant spending flexibility and another £200m is a possibility,"" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport earlier this month.
""If it is excluded, then things will be far more challenging and they may have to sell before buying.""
Chelsea's finances have been bolstered by qualifying for next season's Champions League, while they are set to receive more than £50m for taking part in the expanded Club World Cup.
However, their ability to register new players for European competition next season may be affected by Uefa's financial rules, which are different from the Premier League's PSR rules.
The club were fined 31m euros (£26.7m) on Friday for breaching Uefa's spending rules and could be prevented from registering new players for Uefa competitions unless they have a positive transfer balance by the end of the summer transfer window.
