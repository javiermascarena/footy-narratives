Champions transformed: Slot's Liverpool relaunch explained,"If the secret to Arne Slot's success in his first Premier League season was evolution from the Jurgen Klopp era, then a revolution at Liverpool looks to be the plan for the title defence.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13398183/premier-league-champions-liverpool-will-look-very-different-this-season-after-a-busy-transfer-window,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 19:30:00",Peter Smith,['Liverpool'],"If the secret to Arne Slot's success in his first Premier League season was evolution from the Jurgen Klopp era, then a revolution at Liverpool looks to be the plan for the title defence.
With canny alterations, smart in-game changes and an incredible individual campaign from Mohamed Salah, Slot exceeded expectations with Liverpool's Premier League triumph.
Which makes this summer's overhaul all the more intriguing.
There is a saying that you should strengthen when you're in front. Don't admire the view from the top of the mountain, immediately start planning for how you can climb it again - and how to do it better next time.
But few Premier League champions have been reshaped to go again the way this Liverpool side have. Almost £300m has been spent in the window so far.
A potential British transfer record spend on Florian Wirtz is the headline deal of the window and he will play a leading role in attack. But Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez will transform Liverpool's approach out wide.
There will be knock-on impacts for the centre of defence, Ryan Gravenberch's role in midfield and Mohamed Salah's positioning. Hugo Ekitike has the potential to knit it all together.
While there was an acceptance at Anfield the 2024/25 champions needed a refresh, Slot's season two will see a big shift.
Trent Alexander-Arnold's exit has driven the change. While on the left side, Kerkez looks like the heir to Robertson, reminiscent of the flying Scotsman in his pomp, bombing up and down that flank, overlapping, underlapping, cutting back and crossing, Frimpong is a completely different player to Alexander-Arnold.
Firstly, Frimpong played in a different position to Alexander-Arnold while he was at Bayer Leverkusen, tasked as a right wing-back to get into the danger zone. While Alexander-Arnold delivered from deep at Anfield, Frimpong was virtually a right winger for Xabi Alonso, taking his team up the pitch with his runs off the ball or through his dribbling with it.
Alexander-Arnold delivers the ball into the box, Frimpong delivers himself into the box.
Expect Kerkez and Frimpong to be high and wide when Liverpool attack.
With Kerkez and Frimpong darting into those positions, the opportunity will be there for Wirtz, from the left, and Salah from the right, to step inside onto their stronger foot and take aim at goal or pick out a chance-creating pass.
It's a trademark move from Salah but also one Wirtz caused substantial damage with while at Leverkusen.
Wirtz's range of skills - the top dribbler in the Bundesliga recorded double figures for goals and assists but also led the way for high turnovers - makes him an option in a range of positions. But a roaming role from the left was Alonso's vision for him and could be Slot's plan, with the futures of Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo uncertain.
Salah was the Premier League player of the year and top scorer last term but as the 33-year-old ages, this is a team that now looks set up to enhance his goal threat over work rate. There were already signs of that shift last season, with Salah revealing Slot had relieved him of many defensive duties. It's a theme which could now continue.
The tragic passing of Diogo Jota will be in people's minds whenever Liverpool's central attackers are discussed next season. The Portuguese forward played 37 times across all competitions last year.
Ekitike has joined Liverpool from Eintracht Frankfurt and his performances in the Bundesliga suggest he has the attributes to link up the new-look Liverpool when they go forward.
He's 6ft 3in but more than just a target man. Eager to run the channels or drop into midfield to help build attacks, Ekitike's movement should provide opportunities for Wirtz and Salah to run in behind him and profit from the space he creates.
The hope for Slot will be he can combine that teamwork with a striker's selfishness at times and build on his career-best 15 league goals last season. The Bundesliga's top shot-taker in 2024/25 will carry plenty of threat of his own.
All those attacking ideas will need to be supplemented by smart midfield movement behind.
Gravenberch dropping back between the centre-backs to make a three in the first phase of Liverpool's build-up play was spotted at times last season while the Dutchman also came across to plug gaps in the right-back area at times.
He is likely to be required to do similar next season, while Liverpool will need to lean on Ibrahima Konate's ability to look after the right channel and Virgil van Dijk's experience to marshal all these moving pieces.
Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai will also have key roles, whether they are used as two No8s ahead of Gravenberch or whether one of them drops alongside to form a double pivot. The other will then be tasked with linking up with and running beyond Ekitike as a dynamic No10.
Conor Bradley and Curtis Jones are among a squad of players who will be itching to carve out their own roles, too. With Liverpool aiming to compete across multiple fronts, they will get their opportunities. And further signings could add extra layers to Slot's gameplan.
But one thing is clear: this Liverpool will look a lot different to last year's.

Ekitike joins Liverpool in £79m deal,Hugo Ekitike has signed for Liverpool in a deal worth &#163;79m (&#8364;91.5m) from Eintracht Frankfurt.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399673/hugo-ekitike-joins-liverpool-eintracht-frankfurt-striker-completes-79m-transfer-to-premier-league-champions,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 19:29:00",,['Liverpool'],"Hugo Ekitike has signed for Liverpool in a deal worth £79m (€91.5m) from Eintracht Frankfurt.
Liverpool will pay an initial fee of £69m (€80m) plus £10m (€12.5m) in add-ons for the striker as their summer spending edges towards £300m.
Similar to the Florian Wirtz deal, the majority of the bonuses in Ekitike's move are tied to Liverpool's trophy success and the player making a significant contribution.
Liverpool made their move for Ekitike last week after being told Newcastle striker Alexander Isak is not for sale. Newcastle had a club-record offer of £70m for Ekitike rejected by Frankfurt.
Sky Sports News has been told that Liverpool were comfortable with Newcastle making the first move, as they knew Frankfurt were looking for a bidding war - so the Reds stayed away.
Once Newcastle were close to an agreement, Liverpool entered negotiations, similar to how they signed Luis Diaz from Porto when Tottenham Hotspur were close to doing a deal in January 2022.
One source claims Manchester United made a last-ditch attempt to swoop for Ekitike, but the player had his heart set on Liverpool.
The 23-year-old was an unused substitute during his side's pre-season game against FSV Frankfurt on July 19 and after the game, Frankfurt boss, quoted by Sky Germany, said Ekitike's departure is ""a bitter loss"".
Ekitike scored 22 goals in 48 games across all competitions last season for Frankfurt as he helped them qualify for the Champions League.
Liverpool see him as a multi-functional centre forward who primarily plays as a No 9 but can also drop into a second striker role, or operate wide.
The club believes Ekitike has the potential to become one of the best strikers in the world if he continues on this trajectory.
Liverpool are now the Premier League's biggest spenders, with their summer spree now verging on £300m.
The £79m deal for Hugo Ekitike has taken Liverpool's spending to £295.5m, which is over £75m more than the next biggest spenders in Chelsea.
Liverpool have even spent more than Manchester City and Arsenal combined - the third and fourth biggest spenders - so far.
Tottenham are the fourth biggest spenders with £110.7m spent, just above newly-promoted Sunderland who have spent £107m already.
But how can Liverpool afford Ekitike having already spent a club-record fee to bring Florian Wirtz to Anfield earlier this summer?
Well, the club's financial records indicated they could potentially lose a further £200m this summer and still be compliant with Profit & Sustainability Rules (PSR) - where clubs are permitted to lose £105m over a three-year period.
According to football finance expert Swiss Ramble, the Reds' most recent financial results showed Liverpool have actually made £48m in the current three-year PSR period, partly due to modest recent transfer spend.
That means Liverpool can lose a further £158m and still be compliant next summer.
And while Liverpool have already spent around £185m on new players in the current window - including a fee of up to £116m for Wirtz - the Reds posted a club record revenue of £613.8m for the 2023-24 season, partly due to commercial success.
That figure will only increase on the 2024-25 season accounts given Liverpool added Champions League football, knockout qualification for that tournament and also became Premier League champions.
Academy product Jarell Quansah has already joined Bayer Leverkusen in a £35m deal that represents 100 per cent profit under PSR rules, and the Reds could further boost sales figures by the end of the summer.
And earlier in the summer, Brentford signed backup Reds goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher for an initial £12.5m.
Darwin Nunez, Harvey Elliott and Luiz Diaz are all further potential departures, although a Diaz exit is currently less likely despite Bayern Munich's attempts to prise him away.
Ekitike is a multi-functional centre-forward who can operate as a No.9 but has the ability to fulfil other roles too. As such, Liverpool feel they are signing a high-performing player who is capable of justifying this price tag - and with huge potential to improve.
Much has been made of the similarity between the French forward and Isak, the Newcastle striker who would have been many clubs' top target this summer had it not been for the prohibitive costs of the deal. Ekitike matches up on many metrics.

In fact, the numbers suggest that he brings others into play even more, a team player who makes intelligent runs with and without the ball. Ekitike can stretch defences by attacking the space in behind on transition but is also creative operating in tight spaces.
Critics might point to Isak's superior scoring record - Ekitike registered 15 goals in the Bundesliga last season - but Liverpool may well regard the underlying numbers as more encouraging and evidence that Ekitike could even be undervalued in the current market.
Data experts would take the view that Ekitike's expected-goals figure, which was among the highest in the Bundesliga last season, proves that he is a player whose physicality and intelligent movement sees him arrive in good situations time and time again.
Such numbers tend to regress to the mean. The club would prefer to invest in a player whose numbers are likely to trend upwards. If Ekitike can do that then - even at an initial price of £69m - Liverpool could come to see their investment in him as a bargain.
Sky Sports' Adam Bate:
When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.
""These were players with similar profiles from teams that were better than our team, but not at the distance Paris Saint-Germain were from us,"" Oscar Garcia, Reims' then head coach, told Sky Sports. ""We challenged him to reach the level of the other two strikers.""
On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.
He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. ""Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.""
It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League.
""He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,"" concedes Oscar. ""They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.""

Chelsea in talks to sign Hato and Simons,Chelsea are in advanced talks with Ajax over a deal for centre-back Jorrel Hato and have also held discussions over the signing of RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13400601/chelsea-transfer-news-blues-in-talks-to-sign-ajax-defender-jorrel-hato-and-rb-leipzig-midfielder-xavi-simons,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 12:52:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea are in advanced talks with Ajax over a deal for centre-back Jorrel Hato and have also held discussions over the signing of RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons.
It's understood Chelsea are ready to pay £44m (€50m) for Hato, but Ajax are holding out for around £52m (€60m).
Hato has told Ajax he wants to leave and the clubs have been in locked in high-level talks on Wednesday.
The 19-year-old central defender, who can also play as a left back, has been watched closely by Chelsea, whose interest is longstanding.He is a player they are understood to admire as he has quickly developed into one of the best young defenders in the world.
Chelsea value Hato at around €40m (£35m), using the £38.5m Arsenal paid Ajax for Jurien Timber (£34m, plus £4.5m in add-ons) as a benchmark.
He is contracted to Ajax until 2028 and his agent has confirmed the Blues are in talks to sign the defender.
Humphry Nijman told De Telegraaf: ""Yes, the club has contacted Ajax.
""The only thing I can say is that Jorrel is now in talks with Chelsea.""
Meanwhile, attacking midfielder Simons - another player Chelsea have held talks over - is set to leave RB Leipzig this summer as he has two years left on his contract.
Chelsea have other targets as well and any more incomings are dependent on players also leaving.
Simons is in demand and may wait until later in the window before moving.
Once again, Chelsea have another summer where they are looking to move on players in a bloated squad.
One of the attacking players who could make way for Simons' arrival is Christopher Nkunku - despite the Frenchman playing a significant role in Chelsea's successful Club World Cup campaign.
Many of the players Chelsea are looking to move on were on loan last season. One of them is Raheem Sterling, who returned from an unsuccessful spell at Arsenal last term.
Other players out on loan last term include Joao Felix, Ben Chilwell, Renato Veiga and Axel Disasi.
Another player who Chelsea could move on is Carney Chukwuemeka, with RB Leipzig pursuing a move for the Chelsea midfielder.
Chukwuemeka spent the second half of last season on loan at Borussia Dortmund. But it is Leipzig that are now pushing to sign the 21-year-old, who has three years left on his deal.
Another player Chelsea could move on is Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, with Fulham keen on the midfielder.
It is understood that Fulham have explored the conditions of both a loan and permanent move. A formal approach to Chelsea will follow if they believe there is a deal to be done.
Dewsbury-Hall featured in six of Chelsea's eight Club World Cup matches - starting once. He has a contract until 2029 with the club holding the option to extend for a further year.

'It's a club where dreams come true' - Rashford joins Barcelona on loan,"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as ""a club where dreams come true"".",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13399346/marcus-rashford-joins-barcelona-man-utd-forward-completes-season-long-loan-move-to-laliga-club,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 17:00:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as ""a club where dreams come true"".
The agreed loan deal is for the 2025/26 season with an option to buy him next summer. Sky Sports News understands the option price is around £26m (€30m).
Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.
""I'm very excited,"" Rashford said at his unveiling. ""It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.
""It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.
""It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.""
A Barcelona statement said: ""FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.
""The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.""
Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.
The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.
LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.
The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.
Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.
England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.
Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.
It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.
The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.
Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.
However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.
""The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,"" he said.
""I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.
""I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.
""This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.
""I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.""
Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.
""I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,"" he said.
""It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.
""They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.
""""Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.
""The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.
""To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.
""I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.""
Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill in Barcelona:
As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.
Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.
There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.
And that's how it turned out.
The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.
When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.
""I've nothing bad to say,"" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.
The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind.
The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video.
Apt.
Because at his media unveiling, Marcus Rashford rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.
Sky Sports Football's Nick Wright:
Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.
But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.

'A win-win' - reaction in Barcelona to Rashford's arrival,Spanish football expert Andy West looks at how Marcus Rashford's loan move from Manchester United to Barcelona has been received in Spain.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj9vk917mrjo,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 08:07:52",Andy West,['Manchester United'],"Marcus Rashford's move from Manchester United to Barcelona has provoked huge interest, with fans and media across the UK fascinated to see whether the forward can reignite a stalled career that once looked so promising.
And there's a similar level of intrigue on the shores of the Mediterranean, with Barca fans anxious to see what kind of player is arriving in the Catalan capital.
To gauge the mood, BBC Sport has spoken to three Barcelona-based journalists and asked for their views on the England international's arrival.
Here are the thoughts of Jamie Easton Gombau (La Liga TV presenter), Jordi Pons (Spanish TV commentator) and Toni Padilla (journalist for local newspaper Ara).
How well will Rashford fit in?
Barca's forward line is already well stocked, with veteran marksman Robert Lewandowski, teen sensation Lamine Yamal and rejuvenated Raphinha all coming off brilliant seasons, while further depth comes from Spain internationals Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres. So where does Rashford fit in?
Jamie Easton Gombau: We know from Deco, Barca's sporting director, that they wanted another winger - partly to rest Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, and also to play Raphinha in a different role as a number 10. But Rashford is a joker in the pack because he can also fit as a false nine or striker, which will be even more important this season to give some rest to Lewandowski, considering his age.
Luis Diaz and Nico Williams were the first choices, so Rashford was option C... at least! He's also the cheapest option which is important because Barca's financial situation is a long way from being solved.
Toni Padilla: Barca wanted someone who can play mostly on the left side, but also as a striker. Barca's first idea was to have a younger player, like Williams, but Rashford is still young enough. From a tactical point of view, considering Rashford's evolution in the last few years, it fits perfectly. But we should remember he's only here because Nico said no.
Jordi Pons: Manager Hansi Flick is looking for more alternatives, so he can have competition for places in every position. Above all, he wants to be able to give rest to Raphinha, who started nearly every game across every competition last season. Flick wants to raise the level of the squad.
Is he good enough to improve this Barca team?
Rashford's career has been a mixed bag, with great early promise fading dramatically in more recent times. Do those in Barcelona regard him as good enough to make a meaningful impression for his new team?
Jamie Easton Gombau: Well, it depends on which Marcus Rashford we see. A few years ago, he was quite something - one of the best players in the Premier League. But if he gives the same level of performance that we saw last season for Aston Villa, that won't be good enough for Barcelona.
We need to understand one thing: Barca have effectively swapped Ansu Fati for Rashford, and Fati isn't the player we saw a few years ago. So I think it's a win-win for Barca and for Rashford... and maybe also for Manchester United, because if he scores and assists in double figures, his market value will go up.
Toni Padilla: It will be hard for him to start a lot of games, because Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Lewandowski are already there. Torres and Olmo won't be too happy that Rashford is in town because now they have more competition, but Flick has asked to have a deep squad so Rashford will have opportunities. It's on him: he needs to prove that he deserves to play in the big games.
Jordi Pons: I remember when Rashford was young and promised so much. He beat defenders, ran up and down the wing, and above all I liked his shot from mid-range.
Sometimes players can lose their way, but I see someone who is willing to drop his salary and try to re-establish himself in a team like Barca. A few years ago, everyone was talking about how great he was, and what a huge career he was going to have. Now he's got a big opportunity ahead of him to return to that world-class level.
What do you think about Barca signing an English player?
Rashford becomes the first Englishman to represent Barcelona since Gary Lineker left in 1989, and he will look to emulate the success of his predecessor who scored 52 goals in 138 appearances. But does his nationality matter to Barca followers?
Jamie Easton Gombau: It was about time! It's shocking to me that for a country producing so much talent, so few English players have been coming to La Liga. I think there's a belief around Spain that British players struggle to adapt to the country and the culture, but Jude Bellingham changed that in his astonishing first season for Real Madrid.
Spain and England might be the strongest two footballing countries in the world, so there should be a greater exchange of players and coaches. Before Bellingham it was just one-way from Spain to the UK, but maybe now there will be a change in that tendency.
Toni Padilla: I think most Barca fans will be happy. It's global football now, so you get used to having new players from all over the world arriving every season. It will be a bit strange to see a British player with Barca so that will create hype, but I think people are happy about it.
Jordi Pons: I can still remember being at Camp Nou and singing 'Go Gary Gary, Gary Gary Gary Gary Lin-e-ker!' I was a student at the time, and Lineker was greatly loved by Barca fans. I think most Barca fans appreciate English football because of the atmosphere, the songs of the fans, and being English could help Rashford.
A lot of Barca fans will say 'come on, it's been a long time since we had an English player, let's see what this guy is like'.
Are you worried about off-field distractions?
Over the past few years, Rashford has made more headlines off the pitch than for his exploits on the field. Will his strong personality and ability to capture media headlines be tolerated in the Catalan capital?
Jamie Easton Gombau: People say he arrives with baggage, but what's that baggage? That he became a social activist? Is that a bad thing? I don't think it will be a problem. He just wants to play again and feel important, and he believes Barcelona is the right club for that.
I understand that maybe Rashford has been distracted from football, but remember what happened with Antony: he came from the same club, and it was seen as a very big risk, but he was one of the best players in La Liga for Real Betis in the second half of last season. I don't think there's a major concern.
Toni Padilla: Let's see. Right now in Barcelona we're talking more about the private life of Lamine Yamal after his famous 18th birthday party! That hadn't happened before for such a young player, so it has taken us to a new dimension.
Jordi Pons: I look at what players do on the pitch. After that, if they want to do whatever they feel they have to do, I don't think it matters. I don't think it will be a problem.

How Ekitike shows Slot shift towards Klopp tactics,"Hugo Ekitike is the latest addition in Liverpool's summer rebuild, so is Arne Slot shifting back towards Jurgen Klopp tactics?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g86lj0yr0o,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 18:43:28",Alex Keble,['Liverpool'],"Arne Slot's summer reshuffle was already the most significant by a reigning Premier League champion in the competition's history.
Florian Wirtz's arrival points to a reconstruction of the Liverpool midfield. Deals for Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez mark the end of the celebrated full-back pairing of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson. But the arrival of Hugo Ekitike is the final flourish that makes it practically a full-scale revolution.
This is not Jurgen Klopp's team any more.
And yet, as the Bundesliga stars file in, it curiously looks as though Slot is taking Liverpool on a journey back towards his predecessor's ideas.
Before we consider how and why Ekitike will have an impact on Slot's tactics, it's worth looking at the headline numbers to show why Liverpool are prepared to spend £69m, with £10m in add-ons, on the 23-year-old.
Ekitike scored 15 goals and provided eight assists in 31 Bundesliga games last season, totalling the fifth-most goal involvements in the division. He was also involved in the fifth-most 'attacking sequences' in the Bundesliga.
That can be interpreted as showing the quality of Ekitike's all-round game, whether holding up the ball, running into channels, or bursting in behind.
In that respect – in most respects, in fact – he is very similar to Alexander Isak, albeit with considerably more flair to his game and a penchant for taking players on in the dribble.
He is particularly adept at setting up team-mates, too, creating more chances from open play (44) in 2024-25 than any other Bundesliga forward.
The only slight concern is that Ekitike is a little raw in front of goal. He took 117 shots in the Bundesliga last season, more than anyone else, but converted a disappointing 12.8%, leading to an xG under-performance of 6.6 goals – a bigger gap than any other player in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues.
But that just means Ekitike needs a little tuning up.
It's worth nothing that when Isak was the same age, playing for Real Sociedad in 2021-22, he scored just six goals in 32 league games, under-performed his xG by 3.8, and converted just 8.2% of his shots.
In an era when utilising attacking transitions are of increasing importance, Ekitike's smart assists, his give-and-go moves, and his line-breaking carries into the final third are all hallmarks of the elite modern number nine.
As a case in point, he topped the 2024-25 Bundesliga charts for shot-ending carries (44) and ranked fifth for attempted dribbles (126), while also scoring more goals from fast breaks (4) than anyone else in the division.
That's why Ekitike's arrival represents such an interesting shift for Slot.
In his debut year, Slot tamed the wilder aspects of Klopp's football to create a slower, calmer Liverpool, living up to widely held expectations of a manager who once described Pep Guardiola teams as the ""ultimate joy in football"".
But Ekitike represents a shift back the other way, perhaps reflecting a similar realisation to the one that recently struck Guardiola.
""Modern football is not positional,"" Guardiola told TNT Sports a few month ago, not long after signing a direct and transition-centric forward in Omar Marmoush, Ekitike's striker partner at the time. ""You have to ride the rhythm.""
Slot, too, appears to be making concessions to the way modern Premier League football is changing.
It's telling that Ekitike is arriving in the same summer as another Bundesliga star, Germany international Wirtz, forming a new-look attack built on piercing forward movement and an inclination to weave through the thirds as quickly as possible.
The two should combine superbly. Both are sharp one-touch passers between the lines, both love to crash the box, and both were sculpted in fast-transitioning Bundesliga teams.
That is a clear step change for Slot and, to an extent, a surprising turn back towards the 'heavy metal' days of Klopp.
Is Slot making major revisions to Liverpool's formation?
Along with Wirtz and the two new full-backs, Ekitike points to a different Liverpool set-up.
In 2024-25, some 47 of Liverpool's 86 goals (55%) were scored or assisted by Mohamed Salah, who ran the right wing almost on his own as Alexander-Arnold drifted inside.
By contrast, Frimpong is a very attacking, very wide right-back. That should take some of the pressure off Salah, but it might also see the Egyptian move infield to support the new creator-in-chief Wirtz, Liverpool's first proper number 10 in years.
Adding weight to that theory is Ekitike's history of playing in a strike partnership. He was arguably at his best in a 3-5-2 alongside Marmoush at Frankfurt, with whom he regularly swapped positions in a fluid forward line.
He was also more often than not playing in a two at Reims, where he made his name. Could Slot be planning something similar with Ekitike and Salah?
In a 4-2-3-1, Frimpong's aggressive wing play on the right could free Salah to drift inside and operate as something like a split striker alongside Ekitike, with Wirtz and a number eight sitting just behind.
That would certainly be direct, dynamic and straight-lined, and would certainly be ready for a turn towards fast-transitioning football next season.
But it's just one of the options available to Slot now he has such a versatile number nine leading the charge.
Ekitike can drop like Roberto Firmino or get in behind, can play alone or in a two, and can play transitional football or in a possession-centric side.
He is the real deal: the centre-forward of the calibre and tactical dexterity pretty much every 'Big Six' club has been looking for.
Whether Slot continues with Guardiola-like patience or swings back towards Klopp-like verticality, Liverpool's chances of retaining the Premier League title just improved.

Ex-Man Utd striker Hernandez fined for sexist comments,"Mexico striker Javier Hernandez is fined for making comments that ""promoted sexual stereotypes"".",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd97194vveqo,"Thu, 24 Jul 2025 06:55:40",Sean Kearns,['Manchester United'],"Former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez has been fined and warned about his future conduct after making sexist remarks on social media.
The Mexican Football Federation (FMF) said the 37-year-old, now with Liga MX side Chivas, made a series of statements ""promoting sexist stereotypes that are considered media violence and go against gender equality in sport"" on TikTok.
The striker said on social media that women are ""failing"" and ""eradicating masculinity"".
""Don't be afraid to be women, to allow yourselves to be led by a man,"" said the former Mexico captain.
The comments, which were made last weekend, were met with a backlash in Mexico.
President Claudia Sheinbaum, the country's first female president, said: ""Chicharito is a very good soccer [player] but when it comes to his opinion on women... he still has a lot to learn.""
In a joint statement, the FMF and Mexico's top men's and women's leagues said the Gender and Diversity Commission has started an investigation ""that seeks to prevent and punish this behaviour"" and it will ""take more severe measures in the event of a repeat offence"".
Chivas said the comments were ""contrary to the principles and values"" of the club and that they had taken ""appropriate action"" against Hernandez, though they did not specify which action.
Hernandez, Mexico's all-time leading scorer, joined Manchester United from Chivas in 2010.
He spent four years at Old Trafford, winning the Premier League twice.
After spells with Real Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen, he returned to the Premier League with West Ham for a three-season stint between 2017 and 2020.
Hernandez then joined Sevilla from the Hammers, before spending four seasons with MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy.
He returned to former club Chivas in 2023, signing a two-year deal.

Chelsea in talks for Dutch duo Simons and Hato,Chelsea are in talks over moves for Ajax defender Jorrel Hato and RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyzmv088rpo,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 18:39:28",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have opened talks with Ajax over a move for centre-back Jorrel Hato while pushing ahead with interest in RB Leipzig forward Xavi Simons.
Hato, 19, has emerged as one of Europe's most promising young defenders after an impressive campaign in the Eredivisie, making 31 appearances.
BBC Sport understands that Chelsea are in direct communication with both Ajax and Hato's camp to explore the possibility of a summer transfer. Talks are understood to be in the early stages, with no agreement yet in place.
Meanwhile, Chelsea are discussing personal terms with Simons.
The Netherlands international, 22, is understood to be open to a move to Stamford Bridge, as the Blues look to add more creativity and attacking flair.
RB Leipzig are aware of Chelsea's approach, though no agreement has yet been reached.
Simons, who joined Leipzig permanently from Paris St-Germain in January following two loan stints lasting a season and a half in total, is also attracting interest from Bayern Munich and Arsenal.
Sources indicate Bayern have an interest in Simons but are prioritising a move for Liverpool winger Luis Diaz.
Arsenal, meanwhile, have been made aware of Simons' situation as they consider their summer options.
'Any manager would like him in his team'
Before Euro 2024, former Ajax and PSV coach Aad de Mos said there was ""too much hype"" around Simons.
""At times I think he is too eager,"" explains former Netherlands winger Zenden. ""Not eager as in selfish, but eager to do well.
""He is a threat. He has got the right attitude, he's got the skills, he's got the engine, he is willing to work hard, he is never complaining. Any manager would like him in his team.""
Simons showcased his obvious talent against England in the semi-finals in Germany, with his superb strike putting the Netherlands 1-0 up before the Three Lions recovered to win 2-1.
""He is a very talented player who has so much to give,"" adds Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk.
""He can still be so much better than he is already, but he has a good mentality, so I am not worried that won't happen. I am confident in him.""
Simons, who only made his transfer from PSG to Leipzig permanent in January, enjoyed another productive season for RB - scoring 11 goals and making eight assists across 33 games in all competitions.
But it was not enough to guarantee his club Champions League football, with RB finishing seventh in the Bundesliga.
Who have Chelsea signed this summer?
Chelsea have been active in the summer transfer window as they continue to build a youthful and dynamic squad under their long-term project. The club have already secured several high-potential signings:
Jamie Gittens – £48m from Borussia Dortmund. The England youth international arrives from the Bundesliga with a growing reputation as a direct, pacey winger capable of unlocking defences.
Joao Pedro – £60m from Brighton. Chelsea moved swiftly to secure the Brazilian forward, who impressed in the Premier League with his creativity, link-up play, and finishing ability.
Liam Delap – £30m from Ipswich Town. A powerful striker with Premier League experience, Delap adds a different profile to Chelsea's attacking options.
Mamadou Sarr – £12m from Lyon. The 19-year-old centre-back joins as one for the future, bringing strength and composure in defence after progressing through Lyon's academy.
Dario Essugo – £18m from Sporting CP. A highly rated Portuguese midfielder, Essugo is known for his tenacity and maturity, having debuted in Liga Portugal at just 16 years old.
Estevao Willian - the Brazil winger joined the Blues from Palmeiras this summer in a £29m deal that was agreed in May 2024.
Kendry Paez - a £17m deal to sign Ecuadorian teenager Paez was agreed in 2023 but he has linked up with Chelsea this summer after turning 18 in May.

'I feel like I'm at home' - Rashford joins Barcelona,Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford joins Barcelona on an initial 12-month loan deal.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c873zvn37jvo,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 16:50:11",Sean Kearns,['Manchester United'],"Marcus Rashford says he feels like he is ""at home"" at Barcelona after completing a season-long loan move to the La Liga club.
The 27-year-old has joined on an initial 12-month loan from Manchester United, with the Catalan giants having the option of signing the England international on a permanent basis for £30.3m (35m euros) in 2026.
He is the first men's England international to sign for Barcelona since Gary Lineker in 1986.
Rashford hasn't played for Manchester United, his boyhood club, since last December after being dropped by manager Ruben Amorin, and spent the second half of the 2024-25 season on loan at Aston Villa.
In July, it was confirmed that he was one of five players to tell the club that he wanted to leave.
""I'm very excited,"" Rashford told Barcelona's YouTube channel. ""It's a club where people's dreams come true, they win big prizes.
""What the club stands for means a lot for me. I feel like I'm at home and a big factor in my choice to come here is because it is a family place and a good place for good players to showcase their skills.
""Another factor is because the conversations I had with [Hansi Flick] were positive. What he did last season was terrific. To lead such a young team to a very successful season and come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club and it's everything I wished.
""I'm eager to learn the Barcelona way.""
Barcelona will cover the entirety of Rashford's wages during his time at the club after the forward agreed to take a pay cut.
Removing Rashford from the wage bill is expected to save United between £14-£15m over the next 12 months.
The England international trained with his new team-mates for the first time on Tuesday and is expected to be included in the squad that travels to Japan for a pre-season tour of Asia on Thursday.
In moving, the forward leaves the Premier League for the first time in his career.
Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 matches for Manchester United since making his debut for the club in 2016 and won five major trophies.
He is 15th on the club's all-time scorers list, having emerged from United's academy.
How did we get to this point?
Rashford's departure from Old Trafford has been a relatively long time coming.
Manager Ruben Amorim dropped him for the Manchester derby on 15 December last year - and he has not played for United since.
Amorim later criticised Rashford for a perceived lack of effort, suggesting that he would rather give a place on the bench to his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach than someone who ""doesn't give the maximum every day"".
He joined Aston Villa on loan in January, making 17 appearances and earning an England recall, but returned to Old Trafford last month with his long-term future still uncertain.
However, that uncertainty has been more about where he would go rather than whether he would stay, with Rashford one of five players who told the club they wanted to leave - and who were subsequently told to train separately from the rest of the squad.
But Rashford's problems at Old Trafford pre-dated Amorim.
After signing a new five-year deal at the club in 2023 - following a stellar 30-goal season the campaign before - Rashford's form dropped dramatically.
He managed just eight goals in 43 appearances in 2023/24 and was disciplined three times in 13 months by manager Erik ten Hag.
Rashford was dropped for an away trip to Wolves after turning up late for a team meeting, while he then apologised to the Dutchman for attending a pre-arranged birthday party hours after a 3-0 home defeat by Manchester City.
The forward was then dropped for an FA Cup tie against Newport after reporting ill for training after being pictured partying in nightclubs in Belfast.
Despite his prolonged and public fall from grace at Manchester United, Rashford expressed his gratitude and had ""nothing bad to say"" about the club.
While he alluded to them being in a ""period of change"", he focused more on his ""new chapter"" at Barcelona and the opportunity the move presents to win trophies.
Rashford won two FA Cups, two League Cups, and the Europa League with Manchester United but is yet to win a league title or the Champions League.
""[Manchester United] is in a period of change and they have been for a while. I don't have anything bad to say as it has been an important part not just of my career but my life, so I was grateful for the opportunity,"" Rashford said, speaking to the media following his unveiling.
""I wish them all the best and hope they are successful in the future.
""I want to win the biggest trophies and I feel like Barcelona is a huge club in the football world, so it is the perfect place.
""They have a young, ambitious team and I want to add my qualities, my personality, improve the team, and help them win.
""[The Champions League] is what the club was fighting for last year and they were very close. I hope they can take the next step this year. This is a historic club and they are known for winning the biggest prizes. I am here to help the club do that. It is a dream of mine.""
'United cannot worry about optics' - analysis
There is no doubt a fully-motivated, focused and determined Marcus Rashford would walk into Ruben Amorim's team.
But, in reality, that Rashford has only been seen for one full season since 2021 and the campaign that led to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer getting sacked.
There were signs of the old Rashford during his half season loan at Villa - but there were also games where he didn't perform so well.
Offloading an unwanted player to Barcelona is bizarre for a club in Manchester United's position. But that is where they are right now. What they have to do is maximise the opportunity.
At Old Trafford, they cannot worry about optics. They have to deliver a squad Amorim can drive up the table.

Arteta highlights 15-year-old pair as Arsenal beat Milan,"Mikel Arteta says the performances of 15-year-olds Max Dowman and Marli Salmon were ""incredible"" as Arsenal beat AC Milan 1-0 in their opening pre-season game in Singapore.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn41e8kyp2lo,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 16:18:17",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Mikel Arteta said the performances of 15-year-olds Max Dowman and Marli Salmon were ""incredible"" as Arsenal beat AC Milan 1-0 in their opening pre-season game in Singapore.
Summer signings Martin Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard and Kepa Arrizabalaga also played their first match for their new club in front of supporters.
Bukayo Saka scored the only goal with a close-range finish from Jakub Kiwior's excellent curled cross.
The Gunners dominated for the majority of the match, with Ben White and Saka linking up well down Arsenal's right side.
Ethan Nwaneri - playing in central midfield - produced two standout moments of skill, one of which resulted in a shot from the edge of the area that went narrowly wide.
Manager Arteta handed some game time to the two 15-year-olds in the squad - forward Dowman and defender Salmon.
""It's very good,"" said Arteta about the youngsters on show. ""There is a lot of work in our academy of the coaches, people involved and it is a moment to give opportunities and reward them.
""They certainly took their chance today in difficult circumstances against a very big team. Incredible how at 15 years old they can perform at that level.""
It was agreed there would be a penalty shootout regardless of the result of the match and AC Milan won that 6-5.
Zubimendi, Mikel Merino, Dowman, Leandro Trossard and Josh Nichols scored their spot-kicks but Martin Odegaard, Reiss Nelson, Kiwior and Salmon missed theirs.
Arsenal supporters are likely to be excited by so many academy graduates being included on the tour and Myles Lewis-Skelly, fellow 18-year-old Nichols and 15-year-olds Dowman and Salmon finished the game on the pitch together.
With Saka, Nwaneri and Nelson all playing a part, it means that Arsenal had seven academy graduates feature in total.
""Very happy with all the kids,"" added Arteta. ""I think they are able to play at that level at 15 years old in my opinion because of the environment and culture that is within the team.
""When somebody makes you feel so comfortable and so confident straightaway, you can go and do it. At least it gives you the best chance and then you have to have the qualities this kid has to deliver against opposition like this.""
There has been a lot of excitement around Dowman, with Arteta referencing his talent on a number of occasions last season, and the youngster stepped up to score his penalty in the shootout.
""They are in and around the team constantly and they are getting used to the dynamics and the demands,"" said Arteta.
""They are getting there and that gives them a good platform and they will have to earn it.""
How did Arsenal signings perform?
Arsenal have spent £128m so far this summer to bring in Zubimendi, Norgaard and Kepa, as well as Noni Madueke - with Cristhian Mosquera and Viktor Gyokeres expected to follow.
Madueke has been given two weeks off to rest after his participation in the Club World Cup with Chelsea, but this was the first time supporters had a look at how Arteta may use his other new signings.
Norgaard was the only summer signing to start the match and began in his favoured deep-lying midfield role.
The Denmark international was solid in his positioning and provided a base to allow his fellow midfielders Declan Rice and Nwaneri to get forward.
Zubimendi, a £60m signing from Real Sociedad, came on as a half-time substitute and immediately began to dictate the tempo of Arsenal's play.
He has a more expansive passing range than Norgaard and showed some of his repertoire, but in the heat and with numerous changes in personnel, the game lost its flow.
Goalkeeper Kepa, signed from Chelsea, was not tested during the 90 minutes but in the shootout saved three of Milan's penalties.

Liverpool sign Hugo Ekitiké in £79m deal after fending off late Manchester United bid,Striker joins from Eintracht Frankfurt on six-year deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/23/liverpool-sign-hugo-ekitike-79m-deal-fending-off-late-manchester-united-bid,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 18:30:45",Andy Hunter,"['Manchester United', 'Liverpool']","Liverpool have completed the signing of Hugo Ekitiké from Eintracht Frankfurt, with the striker rejecting a late attempt by Manchester United to hijack the transfer.
The France Under-21 international has joined the Premier League champions for a guaranteed £69m plus £10m in add-ons, having undergone a medical in the UK on Tuesday.
Ekitiké is understood to have signed a six-year contract and will join his new teammates on their pre-season tour of Hong Kong and Japan.
The striker was a longstanding target for Liverpool, despite their interest in the Newcastle centre-forward Alexander Isak, and contact was first made with the 23-year-old’s representatives in January. Arne Slot then outlined his plans for Ekitiké in a call at the end of last season.
Newcastle made a move for Ekitiké last week after missing out on Liam Delap and João Pedro but their £70m bid was rejected by Eintracht and the player made it clear his preference was to join Liverpool. United also received the same information when they made a last-minute attempt to derail the deal. United’s director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, is believed to have contacted Eintracht’s sporting director Markus Krösche over a possible transfer but Ekitiké was already set on Anfield.
Ekitiké scored 22 goals and made 12 assists in his one full season at Frankfurt, helping the club to qualify for the Champions League, and while he is primarily a No 9 Liverpool believe he can also operate as a second striker or out wide.
He is potentially the third most expensive signing in Liverpool’s history behind Florian Wirtz and Darwin Núñez. Anfield officials are confident he can become one of the finest forwards in the game should his recent progress with Eintracht be maintained.
The deal for Ekitiké, which is subject to international clearance, takes Liverpool’s summer spending to almost £300m. The former Paris Saint-Germain player is the club’s seventh signing of the window, following Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and a trio of goalkeepers: Giorgi Mamardashvili, Armin Pecsi and Freddie Woodman.

The forward joins after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim at his boyhood club.
“I want to win the biggest trophies and feel like Barcelona is a huge club in the football world so it is the perfect place,” Rashford said in an official unveiling by the Spanish club. “You see with the team last season, they have a young ambitious team and I want to add my qualities, my personality, improve the team and help them win.”
Earlier, in comments to the club’s own media, Rashford said: “It’s a club where people’s dreams come true and they win big prizes. And what the club stands for really means a lot to me as well. It feels like home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here.”
Rashford was one of five United players made to train away from Amorim’s squad this summer. The England international, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, has been training at a gym in Salford and at United’s Carrington base, although only after first-team players have left.
The 27-year-old forward has three years remaining on a £325,000-a-week contract at Old Trafford. Barcelona said he would become the 10th man to play for them and United, after Mark Hughes, Laurent Blanc, Henrik Larsson, Jordi Cruyff, Gerard Piqué, Víctor Valdés, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alexis Sánchez and Memphis Depay.
“The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, the director of the football area and other board members,” Barcelona said in a statement.
Rashford said: “I was clear on my preference from the beginning. It didn’t work out in January so I went to Aston Villa and enjoyed a good period there. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to play there. The summer came around very quickly, it was time to make another decision. My choice was easy. It’s a family club, something I’m used to from my past.”
Rashford has spent 20 years at United, scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club, but has not featured since being dropped by Amorim for the Manchester derby last December. He said later that month that he was ready for a new challenge.
“The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,” Rashford said. “I don’t have anything bad to say about Manchester United as it has been an important part not only in my career but my life. I was grateful for the opportunity to play for them. But football is like life – not everything goes as simply as you thought and this is my next chapter. I’m fully focused on this and trying to improve myself and helping the team win trophies.”

"We’ve nothing left to prove, says Lucy Bronze as Lionesses reach third straight final",Defender praises England’s spirit after victory over Italy,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/23/england-lucy-bronze-euro-2025-final,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 09:00:49",Suzanne Wrack,['Chelsea'],"Lucy Bronze says England have “nothing to prove” after reaching a third successive major tournament final with a dramatic extra-time win over Italy despite some unconvincing performances.
“Do we have something to prove? Not really,” the Chelsea right-back said. “That’s people from the outside thinking that teams have to win every single game. We’ve done six consecutive semi-finals, three consecutive finals, who else has done that? Nobody. [The current] Spain and Germany are fantastic teams but even they haven’t managed that feat.”
Germany did win five successive Euros and World Cups between 2001 and 2009 but have not reached six consecutive semi-finals. However, a lot has changed since then and the rest of European football, and world football, has caught up.
“It’s hard to stay at the top in international football, there’s so many teams, it’s up and down, they develop, but this team just keeps fighting until the end,” said Bronze. “I feel like we don’t have anything to prove because we’ve been there, we’ve done it many, many times, and it’s just a fact that the game’s getting better and international football’s not as easy as it used to be. Everybody’s fighting and everybody wants to win and everybody feels like they can win.”
England left fans sweating on Tuesday night, Michelle Agyemang’s stoppage time equaliser ensuring the game went to extra time at 1-1 before Chloe Kelly’s penalty in the 119th minute was saved but she was alert and turned in the rebound.
England’s opening group stage defeat to France had sounded alarm bells but that disjointed and sloppy performance was turned around against the Netherlands and Wales as they escaped the group of death.
However, worries about England’s cohesion returned in the quarter-finals, the Lionesses forced to recover from two goals down with 10 minutes remaining against Sweden before extra time and and a penalty shootout saw Sarina Wiegman’s side progress. Against Italy in Geneva on Tuesday night they were again unconvincing for much of the 90 minutes before the super subs delivered.
“I don’t think us doing it the hard way is a concern,” said Bronze. “We’ve also got to give credit to the teams that we’re playing against. Sweden showed a lot of fight, Italy were a really good team. It’s not just about one team just winning every single game.
“We saw that in this tournament, and so many teams are at such a high level, and you switch off for a moment and you’re 1-0 down. We’re just showing that we’ve got fighters in this team and that’s what you need in a tournament.
“To show that we can do that in different scenarios gives you a lot of belief because we know we can play good football as well, we know we’ve got the performances in us. Now we know going into the final that we’re capable of so many different ways of playing and winning and digging in.”
Kelly and Agyemang were again critical to England’s success in Switzerland. “Michelle was so good when she came on,” said the defender Alex Greenwood. “She caused them so many problems and then Chloe goes and scores the rebound from the penalty – that takes a lot of courage to step up to take that. I asked her, she had no doubt in her mind, she was confident enough to take it.”
Sign up to Moving the Goalposts
No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football
Bronze echoed Greenwood’s praise for the impact players. “What a tournament from Michelle, especially coming in with the seniors just a couple of months ago,” she said. “What a great player, what a bright future she’s got. She’s such a humble, lovely down-to-earth girl. Honestly couldn’t think of a nicer person, and then Chloe’s just attitude, sass, confidence.
“I think Chloe’s one of those players who, when she’s on the pitch, no matter what the moment of the game is, or how she’s feeling or how the crowd is, is going to push her shoulders back, big up her chest and go for it. They’re both key players in this team, obviously they haven’t started in this tournament but it just shows the strength of our squad, I don’t know many teams that have that.”
The key for England now is recovery, said Greenwood, with the team having had to come through two 120-minute games, and penalties against Sweden, to reach the Sunday’s final. They do have the advantage of an extra day’s rest over Germany and Spain, who meet on Wednesday evening.
“I’ve played this game long enough to know how to recover from games but it’s going to be crucial from now until Sunday,” said Greenwood. “The biggest message is recovery. We’ll do that properly. We’ve got a fantastic support network and the staff and they work so so hard to make sure we’re ready for every game. The girls are in a Euro final on Sunday and we’ll make sure we do everything we can to be ready for that.”

Arsenal seal €73.5m Viktor Gyökeres deal after late-night breakthrough,Club also poised to confirm Cristhian Mosquera signing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/23/arsenal-seal-viktor-gyokeres-deal-sporting,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 20:41:37",David Hytner,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Arsenal have finally reached agreement with Sporting for the transfer of Viktor Gyökeres in a deal worth up to €73.5m (£63.7m), having resolved the problematic issue of the €10m of add-ons to end a tortuous saga and Mikel Arteta’s hunt for a No 9.
The north London club, who are poised to confirm the signing of the centre-half Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia for an initial €15m, made the official breakthrough late on Tuesday, sending an updated offer to their Portuguese counterparts to satisfy them over the structure of the bonuses.
Sporting have wanted the add-ons to be achievable, based on appearances, goals and assists by Gyökeres plus Champions League qualification, whereas Arsenal had wanted to include some more difficult ones. As the negotiations dragged at the end of last week, it is understood Sporting thought €5m of Arsenal’s proposed bonuses were achievable, €5m not so. One clause that was suggested related to Gyökeres winning the Ballon d’Or with Arsenal.
The negotiations have been handled largely by the agents, with club-to-club contact kept to a minimum. Sporting are comfortable with the resulting bonuses deal, having in effect held out for what they wanted.
Sporting had demanded €70m plus €10m in add-ons; an €80m package was the target, albeit it was less than the €100m release clause in Gyökeres’s contract. They have got there with a basic fee of €63.5m and the agents having agreed to waive their 10% cut of that – a saving to Sporting of €6.35m.
The positions on both sides had long been entrenched, Gyökeres determined to force the move to Arsenal, ignoring interest from elsewhere; Sporting digging in hard for their money. There has been conflict, Gyökeres refusing to report back for pre-season training with Sporting, but Arteta can at last look forward to working with his man.
It was always going to be a pivotal summer for Arsenal and Gyökeres is the latest step in a spending spree. Arteta and the sporting director, Andrea Berta, have overseen the arrivals of Kepa Arrizabalaga, Martín Zubimendi, Christian Nørgaard and Noni Madueke for a combined £118.5m.
Mosquera has travelled to Singapore to link up with the squad on their pre-season tour. The 21-year-old, who represented Spain at this summer’s European Under-21 Championship, has signed a five-year contract which has the option of a further year.
Gyökeres was a sensation at Sporting, scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances. Having signed for £20.5m from Coventry in the summer of 2023, the 27-year-old helped Sporting to the league title in each of his seasons with them – plus the Portuguese Cup in the last campaign.
Chelsea have approached Ajax over the 19-year-old centre-half, Jorrel Hato, who is rated at €40m £35m, and believe he is keen to join them. The London club have been interested in Hato since the turn of the year and the player’s agent has confirmed they have now made a move.
“Yes, the club has contacted Ajax,” Humphry Nijman told De Telegraaf. “The only thing I can say is that Jorrel is now in talks with Chelsea.”
Hato, who has progressed through the youth ranks at Ajax, made his debut for the club as a 16-year-old in January 2023 and has played 111 games for them. Capped six times by the Netherlands, he played at left-back last season but prefers a central role.
According to statistics, the only under-19 outfield player in the top 10 leagues who played more minutes in all competitions than Hato last season was Barcelona’s Lamine Yamal.
