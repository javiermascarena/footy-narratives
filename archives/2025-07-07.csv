There is no club-to-club agreement but there is an apparent willingness from all parties to get a deal done.
Arsenal are thought to be encouraged by the 27-year-old's desire to join, with personal terms not expected to be a problem.
In a fresh development, Sporting have given Gyokeres permission to delay his return for pre-season.
The Sweden international was due back on Monday - a week after some of his team-mates - but he has now been given until Friday as talks with Arsenal progress.
There is no certainty, however, that he will return at all.
Bringing in a striker has been a primary focus for Arsenal in this transfer window - they have explored conditions for a number of players, including RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
Sky Sports News reported in June that Gyokeres was a Manchester United target after they made an initial approach for him through intermediaries.
Last month, Sporting president Frederico Varandas revealed Gyokeres would not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer.
Varandas also disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow him to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.
After joining Sporting from Coventry for around £20m in 2023, Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 matches during his two seasons in Portugal.
Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games in all competitions last campaign, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, as he helped Sporting win the league and the Portuguese Cup.
A move to Arsenal would see Gyokeres return to English football, having joined Brighton in January 2018 before moving to Coventry after loan spells at St Pauli and Swansea.
Gyokeres scored 43 goals for Coventry in his two-and-a-half seasons at the Championship side.
Sky Sports' Nick Wright:
Sporting are expected to make a huge profit on Gyokeres' anticipated sale.
The 27-year-old, who joined Coventry on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.
His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.
He has proved a late bloomer, but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.
Developments around Gyokeres come after Arsenal announced the signing of midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a £51m deal.
The Spain international has signed a five-year contract at the Emirates Stadium after Arsenal agreed the transfer in March, having met his £51m release clause.
Zubimendi became Arsenal's second signing this summer, joining fellow Spaniard Kepa Arrizabalaga at the club following his £5m move from Chelsea.
Brentford captain Christian Norgaard could follow Zubimendi and Kepa through the Arsenal door after a £15m deal was agreed last month to sign the Bees midfielder.
Arsenal appear to be turning their attentions to bolstering their attack now, with Chelsea expecting an offer from the Gunners for Noni Madueke.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

Arsenal complete £51m Zubimendi deal,Arsenal have signed midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a &#163;51m deal.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13376347/martin-zubimendi-transfer-news-arsenal-sign-midfielder-for-51m-from-real-sociedad,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:00:00",,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have signed midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a £51m deal.
The Spain international has signed a five-year contract at the Emirates Stadium after Arsenal agreed the transfer in March, having met his £51m release clause.
It is understood the pre-agreement proved important for Arsenal after Real Madrid expressed a strong interest in the 26-year-old last month following Xabi Alonso's arrival as manager.
Liverpool had also been interested in Zubimendi last summer but he turned down a move to Anfield to stay at Real Sociedad after helping Spain win Euro 2024.
Arsenal worked on the Zubimendi deal last summer and had identified him as their No 1 target when the club knew midfielders Jorginho and Thomas Partey were entering the final year of their contracts, with both players subsequently leaving this summer.
It is understood that Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta played a key role in convincing Zubimendi to wait another year and join the club, with Zubimendi's former Real Sociedad team-mate Mikel Merino also playing a role in his move to north London after he joined the Gunners for £31.6m in August 2024.
Arsenal approached the LaLiga side about signing both players last summer but Sociedad did not want to lose the midfield pair in the same window.
It is understood Arsenal presented a solution with Merino joining in 2024 and Zubimendi joining in 2025.
Zubimendi becomes Arsenal's second signing this summer, joining fellow Spaniard Kepa Arrizabalaga at the club following his £5m move from Chelsea.
Brentford captain Christian Norgaard could follow Zubimendi and Kepa through the Arsenal door after a £15m deal was agreed last month to sign the Bees midfielder, while Chelsea are expecting an offer from the Gunners for Noni Madueke.
Zubimendi had spent his whole career at Real Sociedad, for whom he made 236 appearances in all competitions after graduating from the club's academy.
Zubimendi said: ""This is a huge moment in my career. It's the move I was looking for and one I wanted to make. As soon as you set foot here, you realise how big this club and this team are.
""I set my sights on Arsenal because their style of play is a good fit for me. They have shown their potential recently and the best is yet to come.""
Zubimendi will wear the No 36 shirt and will join up with his new team-mates ahead of pre-season.
Arteta said: ""Martin is a player who will bring a huge amount of quality and football intelligence to our team. He will fit in really well and he has all the attributes to be a key player for us.
""The standard he has consistently performed at over the last few seasons for both club and country is exactly why we are so excited to have him with us.""
Arsenal sporting director, Andrea Berta, added: ""We are so happy to bring Martin to Arsenal and have a lot of pride in finalising this transfer.
""Martin was a key target for us and we all know that he is a perfect fit for our squad with the high quality he has.""
Sky Sports' Nick Wright:
Arsenal believe they are acquiring one of the world's best holding midfielders in Martin Zubimendi and they are not the only ones. Having also been coveted by Liverpool, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona, his elite credentials are clear.
Zubimendi won the European Championship with Spain last year and has thrived domestically as well as internationally, helping boyhood club Real Sociedad win silverware in the Copa del Rey and playing a key role in their return to the Champions League last year.
Here, Zubimendi's former team-mates and coaches compare him to Xabi Alonso and tell Sky Sports what makes him one of the world's best midfielders

A complete No 6? Inside Zubimendi's rise and why Arsenal wanted him,"Arsenal believe they are acquiring one of the world's best holding midfielders in Martin Zubimendi and they are not the only ones. Having also been coveted by Liverpool, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona, his elite credentials are clear.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13368413/martin-zubimendi-to-arsenal-spain-midfielders-quality-and-character-make-him-one-of-worlds-best-no-6s,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:00:00",Nick Wright,"['Arsenal', 'Liverpool', 'Manchester City']","Arsenal believe they are acquiring one of the world's best holding midfielders in Martin Zubimendi and they are not the only ones. Having also been coveted by Liverpool, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona, his elite credentials are clear.
Zubimendi won the European Championship with Spain last year and has thrived domestically as well as internationally, helping boyhood club Real Sociedad win silverware in the Copa del Rey and playing a key role in their return to the Champions League last year.
There is a lot to like about him. The 26-year-old excels in and out of possession, marrying intelligence and outstanding technique with deceptive physicality at the base of midfield, where he acts as a passing metronome and a screen for his defence.
But that is not all. The impression left by speaking to his former coaches and team-mates is of a player defined by his strength of character as much as his technical and physical attributes.
""The first thing to say about Martin is that he is a complete person as well as being a complete player,"" Aitor Zulaika, a former Real Sociedad coach who worked closely with Zubimendi as assistant to Xabi Alonso in the club's B team, tells Sky Sports.
""He has four characteristics which are not easy to bring together. He is a very humble and simple person, but he is also very proud and has a really strong personality. You don't often find players with all those qualities together. Martin is one.""
Benoit Cachenaut, a centre-back who played with a teenage Zubimendi in Real Sociedad's C team, uses the same word to sum him up. ""He was always a very complete player,"" he says to Sky Sports. ""Technical, quick, intelligent, potent.
""You could already see he had everything to get to the highest level. But as well as being very good on the pitch, he was a very humble guy, always smiling, always very friendly.""
Cachenaut recalls a visit from Zubimendi while holed up in hospital after having knee surgery. ""He was one of the only team-mates who came to see me,"" he says. It was typical of a player known for going the extra mile on the pitch as well as off it.
""He was a very disciplined guy who was very serious about his work,"" adds Zulaika. ""He was smart, he listened to his coaches, and he was polite and respectful with everybody.""
He made a similar impression on Carlos Martinez, a former right-back with more than 200 appearances for Real Sociedad.
""As soon as we all saw him play, we could see he had something different, something that catches the attention of those of us who have played football,"" he tells Sky Sports. ""It's just the way he moves the ball and the personality he showed even at such a young age.""
Zubimendi went on to make more than 200 senior appearances for Real Sociedad. An exemplary professional, his personality formed a significant part of his appeal to Arsenal.
The club needed a player with his profile in the No 6 role. ""They still haven't got a deep midfielder who can take the ball on the back foot,"" said Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville recently.
But they also needed someone to replace the experience and leadership they have lost with the departures of Thomas Partey and Jorginho. Zubimendi, although much younger, fits the bill having led by example throughout his time at Real Sociedad.
Crucially, he is also a good fit for Arsenal's manager, with whom he shares common ground. Mikel Arteta, like Zubimendi, grew up in the city of San Sebastian and played for Real Sociedad. They even started out at the same youth club called Antiguoko.
Arteta used that common ground to form a strong connection with Zubimendi in negotiations, playing a crucial role in convincing his countryman to make the move to Arsenal having rejected the chance to join Liverpool a year ago.
Arteta was viewed as a future star right from the start of his time with Antiguoko and went on to join Barcelona's La Masia academy aged 15. Zubimendi, though, did not initially stand out.
""He was very shy and hadn't developed much physically,"" Roberto Montiel, the club's long-serving vice-president, who coached a young Arteta, recalls to Sky Sports.
""Real Sociedad had him on trial a couple of times but didn't sign him,"" he adds. ""He wasn't deemed to be at the right level. It was only when he was 14, after we told them Atletico Madrid were also interested, that they decided to take him.""
By that point, Zubimendi was more developed physically and better able to express his talent.
""He could play with both feet, he was a quick thinker and he was always in the right positions on the pitch,"" says Montiel. ""He was like Xabi Alonso in the way he saw football.""
And Montiel should know. He coached Alonso in the same youth team as Arteta. Alonso would go on to coach Zubimendi in Real Sociedad's B team. The Antiguoko connection continues as, five years on, Zubimendi prepares to work with Arteta at Arsenal.
""I would say Martin was more similar to Xabi than Mikel, as a boy as well as a player,"" says Montiel.
""Like Xabi, he was a great passer who made good decisions. He won the ball well and knew how to protect it. But he was also a bit of an introvert, similarly to Xabi, whereas Mikel was all-in. Martin could go a bit unnoticed because of that.""
It all changed in Real Sociedad's academy, where Zubimendi grew in confidence as well as physical stature. ""He was already a very good player for them in his first year but it was in his second, as an U16, that he really exploded,"" recalls Montiel.
""It was pretty clear to everyone at the club that he was going to make it to the first team,"" adds Zulaika. ""The qualities he showed then were similar to the ones you see now. He is so good with the ball, controlling the game, passing.
""But he defends brilliantly as well. He is good in all aspects. He can pass short or long, he can break lines by driving forward with the ball, he gets shots off, he runs a lot of kilometres, he cuts out so many passes on the ground and in the air.
""When he made the step up to join us in Real Sociedad B, he was a young player playing with guys who were three or four years older than him but it didn't faze him at all.
""He wasn't much of a talker but that was understandable given he was mixing with more senior players. He did his talking with the ball. It didn't take him long to win his place in the team. Once he had it, nobody could get it off him.""
Zubimendi went on to become similarly important at first-team level, playing more minutes for Real Sociedad than any other outfield player across the last three seasons.
But the best demonstration of his ability to excel under pressure came on the international stage last year, when he stepped in seamlessly for the injured Rodri at half-time of Spain's European Championship final win over England in Germany.
Martinez puffs out his cheeks at the mention of it. ""You saw how willing he was to take the ball, to drive forward, to be brave. He just has so much confidence in his ability.""
""The only reason he wasn't starting was because he was behind the best player in the world in his position,"" adds Zulaika. ""We were all well aware of his immense quality but you need to do it on the biggest stage and that is what he did against England.""
Zubimendi showed off his full repertoire in that second half in Berlin, snapping into challenges, zipping passes through the lines and driving Spain forward in a manner that is typical of him.
They are qualities that Arsenal will now aim to harness. Zubimendi excels at circulating possession and constructing attacks from the base of midfield, but he is also a brave and forward-thinking passer.
""It was brilliant playing behind him as a central defender because he always asked for the ball and he was never afraid to play,"" says his former team-mate Cachenaut.
It can be seen in the numbers. In the 2024/25 season, Zubimendi sent a higher percentage of passes forward than either Thomas Partey - whose contract expired and is no longer at Arsenal - Jorginho or Declan Rice, at 31.39 per cent. His completion rate is lower, at 84.42 per cent, but only because he takes more risks.
Of midfielders in LaLiga, only four, all of whom play for either Barcelona, Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid, in Pedri, Federico Valverde, Rodrigo De Paul and Jude Bellingham, made more progressive passes than Zubimendi.
That level of incision will be valuable to Arsenal, particularly after a Premier League season in which they struggled to break down deep-lying defences on a regular basis. Zubimendi has a knack for speeding play up, either through passing or by carrying the ball forward himself.
""I think he is a profile of player they lack,"" says Montiel.
""They have Declan Rice, they have Mikel Merino, they have Martin Odegaard, but they are missing something when playing out from the back with one or two touches.
""I think Zubimendi is the kind of player they need for that. He can play all kinds of passes and on top of that he reads the game so well. I think he could be a really good signing for them.""
""Without doubt,"" agrees Zulaika. ""Whatever the competition, whether it's the Premier League, LaLiga or the European Championship, he would have a place in any team in the world.
""I can't see many better players in his position.""
""He reminds me a lot of Alonso, who had great success in the Premier League, and he is also very good tactically,"" adds Martinez. ""He can drop in and cover at centre-back, at full-back. He understands the game so well. I don't think he will have any problems at all. If you ask me, he is ready.""

Kudus wants Spurs move as talks continue with West Ham,Tottenham remain in talks with West Ham over the signing of forward Mohammed Kudus.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13393075/mohammed-kudus-transfer-news-tottenham-remain-in-talks-with-west-ham-after-bid-rejected,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 10:00:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham remain in talks with West Ham over the signing of forward Mohammed Kudus.
It is understood there is a big gap in valuation after Spurs' opening bid of £50m was rejected immediately.
West Ham are expecting an improved offer for the 24-year-old from their London rivals.
Several other clubs are interested, with Chelsea also exploring the conditions of a deal.
But Kudus only wants to join Tottenham at this moment in time, Sky Sports News has been told.
Personal terms are not expected to be an issue. But the Hammers are under no pressure to sell the Ghana international. He is under contract until 2028 with the club holding an option for a further year.
Spurs are looking to sign a forward who can play across the front line and Kudus fits that bill.
Tottenham have not signed a player from London rivals West Ham since Scott Parker in 2011, meaning if a deal is agreed, it would be the first time the two clubs have done business in 14 years.

Brighton flop to hot property - is Arsenal target Gyokeres ready?,Viktor Gyokeres is one of Europe's most prolific goalscorers but can the Brighton flop do it at the very highest level?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr7zyr5j329o,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:38:02",Neil Johnston,['Arsenal'],"""I don't think he's the guy,"" Rio Ferdinand says of Viktor Gyokeres.
""I've watched him probably three times really, really closely. And three times I've gone: 'He ain't getting that opportunity in the Prem.'""
Gyokeres has scored a phenomenal 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting, also contributing 26 assists.
The Sweden forward averaged more than a goal per game last season, with 54 in 52 appearances.
But when he was being linked with Manchester United, Ferdinand said he was not convinced Gyokeres was a good fit for a team in England's top flight.
The six-time Premier League winner, speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, asked: ""Is there enough - after he's physically matched - to get him a goal?""
Though the deal is not yet done, it looks as though we may find out this season, with Arsenal in talks to sign Gyokeres.
They have been one of numerous top clubs linked with the former Brighton player after an outstanding couple of seasons with Sporting, where he played under United boss Ruben Amorim.
In addition to his 39 goals in Portugal's Primeira Liga in 2024-25, Gyokeres helped himself to another six in the Champions League - including a hat-trick against Manchester City.
He has gone from leaving Brighton without playing a single minute of Premier League football to becoming one of Europe's most prolific marksmen - via loan spells in the Championship at Swansea and Coventry, and in Germany with St Pauli.
So how did Gyokeres establish himself as one of this summer's hottest transfer targets?
The one that got away?
Brighton have developed a reputation as masters of the transfer market - renowned for developing young talent and selling them on for hefty fees.
In January 2019, they signed Alexis Mac Allister from Argentinos Juniors for an undisclosed, but reportedly small fee. The midfielder went on to win the World Cup with Argentina in 2022 before joining Liverpool in a £55m deal in 2023.
Midfielder Moises Caicedo signed from Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle for £4m in 2021. Two years later he joined Chelsea in a deal worth a British record £115m.
Gyokeres, however, is different.
Having failed to make the grade, Brighton allowed him to join Coventry for a small fee in July 2021 after an unspectacular return of three goals in 19 Championship appearances during a loan spell with the Sky Blues.
Two years later he went to Sporting for £20.5m after scoring 38 times in 91 league games for Coventry across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons.
While playing in Lisbon, Gyokeres has scaled new heights and is now expected to cost about £70m.
He has also played on the international stage as part of an exciting attacking line-up for Sweden, alongside Newcastle's Alexander Isak and Tottenham's Dejan Kulusevski.
Gyokeres scored nine goals in six games for his country - including four in one match against Azerbaijan - in the 2024-25 Nations League.
But it is not just his goals that have earned him attention.
Gyokeres is known for his intelligent movement and intense work-rate, and his blend of physical strength, technical skill and tactical awareness have earned him admiring glances from clubs.
He is a creator as well as a goalscorer, with a lot of his chance creation coming from his love of running with the ball.
Is Gyokeres the one that got away as far as Brighton are concerned?
""Players develop at different rates,"" their long-serving chief executive Paul Barber told The Athletic, external last November.
""In 2021, when Viktor was transferred to Coventry, his pathway here wasn't clear and, with his contract running down, he wanted a permanent home.
""We have to accept the decision to sell for what it was at that time - right for the player, and right for the club.
""What Viktor has gone on to do is fantastic.""
'Viktor, pass the ball. Pass'
Gyokeres' former team-mates and coaches remember a young boy who cried when he lost. They talk about a ""stubborn kid"" who was ""wild, really aggressive"" and would occasionally come to blows with team-mates.
""I remember the older players were sometimes telling him to calm down a little bit, because he was always going all-in,"" Magni Fannberg, who handed Gyokeres his first-team debut for Swedish club Brommapojkarna in 2015, told the Times., external
There are stories about Gyokeres' single-mindedness, focus and drive.
Gustav Sandberg Magnusson, who played with Gyokeres at Brommapojkarna, adds: ""There was one training session I was screaming at him: 'Viktor, pass the ball. Pass.' And he didn't [look at] me. I was so frustrated.""
David Eklund, academy scout at the club, tells BBC Sport: ""He was never a superstar like Dejan Kulusevski. But he scored goals. That's it.
""He had a strong mentality but he's a really nice guy. He always worked hard and had the idea of being a top player, training every day. He wanted to prove people wrong.""
Dennis Lawrence, who was part of Mark Robins' backroom staff at Coventry when Gyokeres was there, says: ""I had to laugh when I saw he scored a free-kick for Sporting. At Coventry, he would try free-kicks [in training] and I would say: 'No, you're not on free-kicks, Viktor.'
""But his mentality is, 'no, I know I can do this'.
""And he's scoring these incredible free-kicks now. He's got that ability to focus on and achieve anything he wants.""
It all started on the gravel pitches of his local grassroots club in Stockholm, IFK Aspudden-Tellus. Gyokeres was five at the time and he credits his father, Stefan, in his development.
""Making that journey together helped me a lot. We'd share good and bad moments,"" says Gyokeres, who has since gone on to make a big impression - on and off the pitch.
He has been the cover star for Vogue Scandinavia, who described the player as Swedish football's ""pride and glory"".
Will Gyokeres flourish in a tougher league?
Take a glance at the list of leading goalscorers in Europe's top leagues in 2024-25 and the usual suspects are there.
Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe managed 31 in his debut season in La Liga, Mohamed Salah contributed 29 goals as Liverpool claimed the Premier League crown, while Robert Lewandowski finished on 27 during Barcelona's title-winning season - one more than England captain Harry Kane's tally for Bayern Munich.
Gyokeres, who is 6ft 2in (1.89m), managed 39, though the Primeira Liga is not considered one of the top five leagues in Europe.
The question is whether he can be quite so prolific in a stronger league. He has just turned 27 and is still to play a single game in Europe's top five divisions - hence Ferdinand's comments.
It is perhaps worth noting 35% of his goals in 2024-25 came from penalties, as he successfully converted all 19 of his spot-kicks.
There's little denying that Gyokeres is a goalscorer, but will he be such a success against elite-level defences?

Zubimendi joins for £60m - how Arsenal signed Arteta's 'obsession',Arsenal's £60m signing of Real Sociedad's coveted midfielder Martin Zubimendi has origins in the summer of 2024.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0m88ml0x7mo,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 11:00:45",Sami Mokbel,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have completed the signing of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a deal worth almost £60m.
The Spain midfielder is the Gunners' second signing of the summer transfer window, following the arrival of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea for £5m.
They are also in talks to sign Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres for £70m.
Zubimendi, who rejected an approach from Liverpool last summer, came through the ranks at Real Sociedad before becoming a regular in their first team.
The 26-year-old deep-lying midfielder - who played 236 times for the Spanish club, scoring 10 goals - has signed a five-year deal.
""This is a huge moment in my career,"" said Zubimendi. ""It's the move I was looking for and one I wanted to make. As soon as you set foot here, you realise how big this club and this team are.
""I set my sights on Arsenal because their style of play is a good fit for me. They have shown their potential recently and the best is yet to come.""
Last season Zubimendi was part of the side beaten 4-1 at Old Trafford as Sociedad, who finished 11th in La Liga, were knocked out of the Europa League by Manchester United.
He helped his country win Euro 2024, coming on for Manchester City's Rodri at half-time in the final against England as Mikel Oyarzabal's goal claimed the trophy for Spain.
He has 19 caps and has become a regular for Spain as a result of Rodri being sidelined last season by a serious knee injury.
Zubimendi scored in the recent Nations League final against Portugal before Spain lost on penalties.
""Martin is a player who will bring a huge amount of quality and football intelligence to our team,"" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta.
""He will fit in really well and has all the attributes to be a key player for us.
""The standard he has consistently performed at over the last few seasons for both club and country is exactly why we are so excited to have him with us.""
Arsenal have also agreed a deal with Brentford to sign midfielder Christian Norgaard for an initial £10m.
Paying more than the release clause
For Arsenal, the beginning of the end of Zubimendi's signing began in the scorching heat of Spain's south coast as long ago as last June.
In truth, though, the journey culminating in the midfielder's arrival at Emirates Stadium was spawned well in advance of that covert visit to Andalusia last summer.
Arteta had watched Zubimendi extensively. He was taken by his ability to execute the full passing repertoire with precision and timing.
A controller of matches, Zubimendi became an obsession for the Arsenal head coach.
With that in mind, a delegation from the Emirates, including then sporting director Edu and his number two Jason Ayto, flew to Marbella for a meeting with counterparts from Real Sociedad.
To greet them in Spain was Roberto Alabe, the La Liga club's then sporting director, and president Jokin Aperribay.
For Edu and Ayto, the primary aim of their deployment was to strike a deal for Sociedad midfielder Mikel Merino, who was an immediate target for Arsenal.
But then arrived the curveball.
Arsenal's recruitment heads explained that, while they wanted to sign Merino before the 2024-25 season, they also had designs on midfield partner Zubimendi.
But here was the catch - they wanted to sign Zubimendi in the summer of 2025. Their finances last summer would not allow them to do both.
There was the added complication of Liverpool's interest in the 26-year-old.
Recently appointed Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes had entered into negotiations with Sociedad over a move for Zubimendi, to the point where the Anfield club believed they were close to tying up the deal.
However, sources have since indicated that, while the midfielder was attracted by a move to Merseyside last summer, he was apprehensive that the decision was too rushed, particularly in the middle of a European Championship summer.
Working with former Socieded midfielder Arteta - and being reunited with Merino and ex-Sociedad playmaker Martin Odegaard - was a prospect Zubimendi was captivated by.
Arteta and Zubimendi were both also born in the Basque city of San Sebastian.
Equally, Zubimendi and his representatives made it clear they wanted to be respectful to Liverpool.
The scenario of any news leaking out of the Spaniard turning down a move to Anfield in favour of the Emirates was one all parties were keen to avoid.
Nevertheless, Edu and Ayto departed Marbella with an agreement in principle for both Merino and Zubimendi.
In terms of the Zubimendi deal, Arsenal expressed their preference to pay more than the player's £51m release clause in order to spread the cost of the fee.
Release clauses in Spain require the purchasing club to deposit the agreed fee in full in one payment - a scenario Arsenal wanted to avoid.
It is one of the reasons Arsenal have not acted upon their interest in Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams, who had a 58m euro (£50m) release clause before signing a new deal with the club earlier this week.
But, while the structure of the deal was verbally agreed in Marbella, there remained one major obstacle to overcome for Arsenal.
Fear Real could scupper deal
As early as last June, Arsenal were getting wind of Real Madrid's interest in then Bayer Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso - who admires Zubimendi, having worked with him in Sociedad's B team - to replace the incumbent Carlo Ancelotti.
It was a situation the Gunners feared could scupper their plan to sign Zubimendi, despite the agreement struck by all parties that the player would join this summer.
The fact Zubimendi and Alonso are clients of the same agency was also a dynamic that provided Arsenal with cause for concern, despite leaving Spain with the player's word that he would join.
With that in mind, Arsenal knew they needed to complete the formalities of the deal as quickly as possible.
As summer moved into autumn there was still no tangible confirmation that Madrid - with or without Alonso - would make a move for Zubimendi.
Edu's decision to leave Arsenal in November left the formal aspects of the deal to be executed by Ayto, who would be elevated to the position of acting sporting director after the Brazilian's exit.
In January, Ayto - alongside director of football operations James King - took charge of completing the final stages of the deal by overseeing the verification of all the relevant paperwork for Zubimendi to join, pending a successful medical.
Alonso's confirmation as Real head coach set the rumour mill into overdrive. One Spanish newspaper splashed a picture of Zubimendi across their front page accompanied with a story saying Real were moving for the midfielder.
Ultimately, however, any talk of Real hijacking Arsenal's move has been redundant. The deal was done - it had been for more than six months.
Zubimendi has stayed true to his word - not that it was ever in doubt from those at Arsenal involved in the deal.
The player arrived in London at the end of June to visit the club's London Colney training ground to meet his colleagues and carry out media duties in preparation for his official unveiling.
He has become the first significant signing of Andrea Berta's reign as sporting director.
But this is a deal concluded by Edu and Ayto, who has also since departed the Emirates, in the sweltering heat of Spain's south coast last summer.

Arsenal in talks to sign Sporting striker Gyokeres,Arsenal are in talks with Sporting about a deal to sign Sweden striker Viktor Gyokeres,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj61nd0n9rxo,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:24:20",Sami Mokbel,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal are in talks to sign Sporting's prolific Sweden striker Viktor Gyokeres for £70m.
As first revealed by BBC Sport on Thursday, Arsenal have had a clear focus on completing a deal for the 27-year-old in recent days and the club are now advancing in their pursuit of the forward.
Discussions over personal terms for Gyokeres and with the Lisbon club over a transfer fee are accelerating, with Arsenal's sporting director Andrea Berta leading negotiations.
A deal has not been finalised though, and there remains a degree of caution at Arsenal until agreements are reached.
Gyokeres has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League after scoring 97 goals in 102 matches during two seasons in Portugal.
The Gunners completed the £60m signing of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad on Sunday.
But the movement towards a deal for Gyokeres represents a significant development in Arsenal's summer transfer business given a new striker was the club's main priority.
Gyokeres' task is clear - analysis
Sami Mokbel, senior football correspondent
It appears Viktor Gyokeres will be the man Mikel Arteta will rely on to make the difference next season.
Arsenal's critics are adamant the club's title challenge foundered last season because of their lack of an elite forward.
If Gyokeres arrives, they are recruiting a striker who has scored prolifically in the Portuguese top flight.
The obvious question is how that goalscoring ability translates into the Premier League. If all things go according to plan, we are about to find out.
Arsenal are tired of finishing second, so Gyokeres' task is clear: propel the Gunners to the title.
Who is Viktor Gyokeres?
Gyokeres made his professional debut in 2015 in his native Sweden for IF Brommapojkarna.
By September 2017, he had caught the eye of newly promoted Premier League side Brighton and agreed a two-year contract with the Seagulls, officially joining the following January.
While still playing for Brighton's youth team, he made his debut for Sweden in January 2019 in a defeat by Finland. He scored his first international goal three days later in a 2-2 draw with Iceland.
However he still struggled for opportunities with Brighton and was sent on loan to German second-tier side St Pauli for the 2019-20 season.
It was at the Hamburg club where he began to thrive, scoring seven goals in 26 appearances.
A month into the following season, Gyokeres scored his first, and only, Brighton goal - finding the net in a 4–0 League Cup victory over Portsmouth.
Nevertheless, weeks later he was loaned to Championship side Swansea City.
He played 12 times and managed one goal for the Swans during three months in Wales before being recalled by Brighton and sent on loan to Coventry City in January 2021.
Gyokeres scored three goals in the second half of the season, including his first league goal in English football, and made his move permanent that summer at the age of 23.
During the next two seasons, he would become one of the most prolific strikers in the Championship.
In 116 appearances for the Sky Blues he scored 43 goals and helped Coventry to a FA Cup semi-final in 2023, where they lost on penalties to Manchester United.
In the same season, he was named in the Championship team of the year as Coventry reached the play-off final, but were beaten on penalties again - this time by Luton Town.
That summer he moved to Portugal, signing for Sporting for about £20m.
Since his arrival in Lisbon, Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 appearances and helped Sporting win back-to-back league titles as well as the 2024-25 Portuguese Cup.

West Ham reject £50m Kudus bid from Tottenham,West Ham reject a £50m bid from Premier League rivals Tottenham for Mohammed Kudus.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj9v73zng01o,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 13:07:27",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"West Ham have rejected a £50m offer from Tottenham for Mohammed Kudus.
The Ghana international is open to a move away from London Stadium and is prioritising a switch to a Champions League side.
Spurs fit that bill after qualifying for the competition by winning the Europa League.
Talks are ongoing, with West Ham open to letting the 24-year-old attacking player leave.
Kudus, who joined West Ham in a £38m deal from Ajax in 2023, has an £85m release clause but Tottenham are looking to sign him for less than that.
At least six top clubs have enquired about Kudus in recent weeks.
Chelsea did hold talks regarding a move for him, but it is understood a move to Stamford Bridge is unlikely.
Well-placed sources have told BBC Sport that Kudus is prioritising a move to Spurs this summer.
West Ham may look to sell one of their stars with a view to reinvesting the recouped money into the squad as manager Graham Potter prepares for his first full season in charge.
Kudus, who still has three years to run on his contract, has 13 goals and nine assists in 65 Premier League appearances for the Hammers.

Switzerland keep Euro 2025 dream alive after Reuteler and Pilgrim knock out Iceland,,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/06/switzerland-iceland-euro-2025-match-report,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 21:27:54",Louise Taylor,['Manchester City'],"Iceland will be leaving the party early but, following some initial wobbles, the hosts are still going strong.
After losing their tournament opener to Norway, Switzerland ultimately settled a nation’s nerves thanks to a combination of smart ­substitutions on Pia Sundhage’s part and some excellent play from ­Manchester City’s Iman Beney at right wing-back.
Eventually the stage was set for second-half goals from the impressive Géraldine Reuteler and the substitute Alayah Pilgrim to ignite the celebrations among a near 30,000 crowd in Berne. Those fans headed home knowing that a quarter-final place beckons for Sundhage’s Switzerland.
Providing her players do not stumble against Finland in Geneva on Thursday they should be on course to finish behind Norway in Group A and reach the knockout phase of a European ­Championship for the first time.
No matter that they may well end up facing Spain in the last eight, all the indications are that this young team have started to lose their initial inhibitions and really enjoy themselves.
“I’m so happy,” said the Swiss captain, Arsenal’s Lia Wälti. “We got carried, step by step, by our fans. It was an incredible atmosphere.”
Initially though Iceland proved rather awkward guests, almost scoring inside the first minute when Ingibjörg Sigurdardóttir’s half-volley struck the crossbar following her connection with a long throw.
After more than a week of glorious Swiss summer sun heavy rain lashed down on Berne, leaving players from both sides slipping and sliding on the pitch, and forcing the Iceland manager, Thorsteinn Halldórsson, to keep wiping raindrops from his glasses.
Sundhage, sheltering deep in the dugout, watched her team whip in a corner and Svenja Fölmi head goalwards.
When the ball hit Glódis Viggósdóttir it flew into the back of the net and, almost everyone bar the 2,000 Iceland fans present went wild. Or at least they did until VAR intervened to correctly disallow that effort for a foul in the preamble, namely Fölmi’s overly aggressive block on Viggosdóttir.
For a while things turned ­thoroughly niggly and scrappy. There were far too many cheap concessions of possessions, snide fouls, substandard set pieces and disappointing final balls.
Barcelona’s Sydney Schertenleib had the crowd on the edge of their seats whenever she ran at Iceland’s back line but sometimes wayward final decision making betrayed the exciting 18-year-old’s very real talent.

No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football
Although Beney, also 18, did her utmost to raise the tone, it was becoming increasingly apparent that the game’s sometimes frightening intensity could not camouflage an absence of quality.
A watershed arrived when Karólína Vilhjálmsdóttir grazed the top of the crossbar with a 20-yard free-kick at the start of the second half. ­Significantly that catalytic moment seemed to inspire Beney to step up her attacking efforts as Sundhage turned to her bench and Switzerland began dominating proceedings.
Swiss fans’ fears that possession can be overrated and is liable to come undone in the face of long Icelandic throws finally faded in the 74th ­minute. When ­Schertenleib swivelled seamlessly and cued up a perfectly poised Reuteler to unleash a beautifully weighted low shot, ­Iceland looked condemned to an earlier than hoped flight back to Reykjavík.
Indeed with Reuteler increasingly influential in midfield, a ­swashbuckling Swiss finale was crowned by Pilgrim’s fabulous, if deflected, 90th-minute finish from the edge of the penalty area.
“We have a really young team,” said Wälti. “In some actions we can be a little but rushed and we wasted a lot of chances before, in the end, we took them.”

Arsenal close on Viktor Gyökeres after signing Martín Zubimendi in £50m-plus deal,Sporting No 9 agrees terms as talks over fee continue,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/06/arsenal-sign-martin-zubimendi-real-madrid-interest-real-sociedad,"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 13:26:16",Ed Aarons,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Arsenal are closing in on the signing of Viktor Gyökeres from Sporting after agreeing personal terms with the Sweden striker. Negotiations are continuing over a fee for the 27-year-old, with Arsenal hoping to strike a deal for less than the £68m asking price.
Gyökeres has made no secret of his desire for a new challenge, having scored 54 goals for Sporting last season, and is understood to have made clear he wants to join Arsenal despite interest from elsewhere in the Premier League, including Manchester United.
Arsenal had identified Gyökeres as one of their two main targets to add firepower, with strong interest also in RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. With Mikel Arteta keen to bring in reinforcements as soon as possible, Arsenal’s sporting director, Andrea Berta, is understood to have stepped up efforts to sign Gyökeres after the arrival of the midfielder Martín Zubimendi was confirmed on Sunday.
Gyökeres, who joined Sporting from Coventry in 2023, is believed to have agreed a five-year deal at the Emirates. It is understood that his former club Brighton would be due money under a sell-on clause.
Zubimendi, who turned down Liverpool last summer, has joined on a five-year deal. The Spain international was heavily linked with Real Madrid in recent weeks despite being understood in March to have a pre-agreement to join Arsenal.
Arteta made the 26-year-old his primary midfield target as Arsenal attempt to bridge the gap after three successive runners-up finishes in the Premier League, and Zubimendi’s signing represents a major boost after the departures of Jorginho and Thomas Partey at the end of their contacts last week. Partey was charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault – allegations he denies – three days after leaving.
Arsenal are believed to have been searching for midfield replacements since last summer, with Zubimendi emerging as their preferred option thanks to his impressive displays for Real Sociedad and Spain. Their attempts to sign him last summer alongside Mikel Merino – who left Real Sociedad for about £32m – are understood to have been rejected because the Spanish side did not want to lose both players in the same transfer window.
Arsenal were able to secure a pre-agreement in March after continuing talks. The fee is believed to be slightly more than his release clause of £51m after they fought off late interest from Madrid, whose new manager, Xabi Alonso, coached Zubimendi for Real Sociedad’s B side.
“Once I made the decision to leave, I set my sights on Arsenal because I think their style of play is a good fit for me,” Zubimendi told his new club’s website. “It’s a young, highly motivated and ambitious team. They have shown their potential recently, and I believe the best is yet to come.”
Brentford’s Christian Nørgaard is also expected to complete his move to north London after the clubs agreed a deal worth up to £15m, and Arsenal are understood to have discussed personal terms with Chelsea’s Noni Madueke and are weighing up whether to bid for the England international.
Arteta said of Zubimendi: “Martín is a player who will bring a huge amount of quality and football intelligence to our team.”

The Liverpool forward died along with his brother, André Silva, in a car accident in Spain on Thursday.
Alexander-Arnold is at the Club World Cup in the United States with Real Madrid having left Anfield at the end of their title-winning 2024-25 season. He spoke to Dazn after Madrid’s quarter-final victory over Borussia Dortmund in New Jersey.
“Some things are bigger than the game,” the right-back said. “It has been difficult but it’s been very emotional, very heartwarming to see the footballing world uniting and come together to show their love and support to him and his family, and obviously his brother as well.
“So although it’s been difficult, it’s also been a nice showing out from everyone, all clubs, all people, uniting and showing love and support for what must be a mind-blowingly hard time for the family.
“I’ve been … around him and his brother, his family, his amazing wife, his parents, his amazing three children. It’s truly, truly heartbreaking to wake up to news like that. It’s something that you would never, ever expect.
“He was a very close friend, someone who lit up a room when he was in it. I shared the dressing room for five years [and have] amazing memories on and off the pitch with him. It goes without saying he will never be forgotten by anyone. He will live long in all our memories for the amazing man and player he was.”
