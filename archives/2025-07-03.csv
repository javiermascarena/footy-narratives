Chelsea sign Pedro from Brighton with forward to join CWC squad,Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro from Brighton in a deal worth up to &#163;60m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13390865/joao-pedro-transfer-news-chelsea-sign-forward-from-brighton-with-brazil-international-to-join-club-world-cup-squad,"Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:00:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m.
The 23-year-old has signed an eight-year deal and is already in the USA with his new Chelsea team-mates for the Club World Cup.
Pedro will be able to play for Chelsea at the tournament as clubs are allowed to register players between June 27 and July 3.
It means the Brazil international could make his Chelsea debut in the Club World Cup quarter-finals against Palmeiras in Philadelphia on Saturday and has the chance to win a trophy within his first month at the club.
""I grew up watching the Premier League, and Chelsea were a club that won trophies. So, when you join Chelsea, you can only think one thing: to win trophies,"" he said.
""Every competition, you have to think, 'I play for Chelsea and that is my ambition'.""
Newcastle had also been interested in Pedro and had a bid of around £50m rejected, but it is understood Pedro only wanted to play for Chelsea.
Watford, who sold Pedro to Brighton for £35m in 2023, will be due 20 per cent of the profit from this deal. Chelsea have good relations with Brighton, who have a sell-on clause in the deal.
The Blues view Pedro as a versatile forward who can play as a No 9 or across the front line. He scored 30 goals in 70 appearances
Pedro's transfer takes Chelsea's spend on Brighton players to £260m since 2022. He has followed Marc Cucurella (£63m), Robert Sanchez (£25m) and Moises Caicedo (£115m) in making the move to west London.
Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler says selling Pedro to Chelsea is an ""excellent deal"" for the club
Hurzeler said: ""This is a good move for all parties. It's an excellent deal for the club, and a good return on a significant investment in an area of the pitch where we have a lot of competition and are already well served in terms of our attacking talent.
""It's also an exciting move for Joao: it gives him the opportunity to play Champions League football this coming season, and he will of course be keen to cement his position in the Brazil team ahead of the World Cup next summer.
""Joao has given us some wonderful moments - during my time and before I came to the club - so on behalf of everyone I would like to thank him for his service over the past two seasons and wish him the best for the future.""
Sky Sports News' James Savundra and Elliot Cook:
Brighton had no intention of selling Pedro in this window but were aware of mounting Premier League interest.
The 23-year-old's ambition to play at the top level of European football has been no secret and he's also keen to put himself firmly in the picture for next summer's World Cup.
Brighton will continue to sell players when they consider it the right time for both themselves and the player - as long as the value is matched. They will not stand in a player's way if their value is met.
After Pedro was sent off against Brentford and was involved in an altercation during training with Jan Paul van Hecke, it seemed an exit this summer could happen.
While he is not regarded as a troublemaker, the incidents did not go down well internally. Pedro moved to Brighton from Watford in May 2023 and had 40 goal contributions in all competitions across 70 games.
He was the top scorer in the Europa League group stage during the 2023/24 season, including a late winner against Marseille.
The fee from Chelsea represents a significant profit on a player who helped the club achieve a top-10 finish last season and who was their top scorer in their first campaign in Europe.
The club will bide their time when it comes to assessing their attacking plans. Their existing options include record signing Georginio Rutter, Danny Welbeck, Evan Ferguson and new signing Charalampos Kostoulas - whom the club have extremely high hopes for.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Quansah completes Bayer Leverkusen move,Jarell Quansah has completed a move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen in a deal worth up to &#163;35m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13391330/jarell-quansah-transfer-news-defender-completes-move-from-liverpool-to-bayer-leverkusen,"Wed, 02 Jul 2025 10:00:00",,['Liverpool'],"Jarell Quansah has completed a move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen in a deal worth up to £35m.
Sky Sports News understands the fee is an initial £30m guaranteed plus £5m in easily-achievable add-ons.
Liverpool are understood to have secured a buy-back clause in the deal for a pre-agreed fee.
Quansah made 25 appearances in all competitions for the Reds last season, helping them win the Premier League having made his senior debut under Jurgen Klopp in 2023.
In total he made 53 senior appearances for Liverpool, scoring three goals and also winning the Carabao Cup in 2023/24.
He makes his move to Bayer Leverkusen, now managed by former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag, having played a key role in England's U21 European Championship success in Slovakia.
He has signed a five-year contract and the deal represents the third between Liverpool and Bayer Leverkusen this summer, with Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong having moved in the opposite direction.
A statement on Liverpool's official website read: ""Everybody at LFC would like to thank Jarell for his contributions and wish him the very best for the future.""
The deal to sell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen is considered ""best of all worlds"" at Anfield.
The Reds did not see Quansah playing regularly next season and, at his age - and given he did so well at the U21 Euros for England - he needs to play regularly.
A move to Leverkusen gives him valuable experience and a chance to develop his considerable skill set. It also gives Leverkusen a centre-back who has the potential to make a significant impact on the Bundesliga.
And, by way of the buy-back clause, it affords Liverpool the security of knowing they retain an option on the future of a player they still rate highly.
Liverpool continue to be linked with centre-backs and the club are aware that will be the case given they have sold Quansah, wanted to sign Dean Huijsen, and that Ibrahima Konate is entering the last year of his deal.
The club plan to follow clearly laid out strategies rather than being attracted to any particular name on the market, and that is plan includes a preferred profile for that particular position.
Sky Sports News has already reported that they want a young profile to develop to replace Quansah.
Given recent spending, they also have a limited budget, particularly for a position in which they already have proven quality and strength in depth.
That being said, Liverpool would only consider deviating from that preferred profile in the event of a significant market opportunity becoming available.
Marc Guehi is a player they have an interest in but his fee is expected to be high. Sky Sports News understands a move for him would be more tied to the situation around Konate, than Quansah.
Guehi wants to be a first-choice player wherever he goes, if he is to leave Crystal Palace this summer. It does not make sense for him to move on to be a back-up, especially in a season that precedes a World Cup.
Liverpool are also well stocked at centre-back even without Quansah - they have Virgil Van Dijk, Konate and Joe Gomez. Manager Arne Slot has also shown a willingness to deploy Wataru Endo and Ryan Gravenberch at centre-back too if need be.
Meanwhile, Liverpool have rejected an approach from Bayern Munich for Luis Diaz.
Max Eberl, Bayern's sporting director, has been told the 28-year-old is not for sale, and discussions have gone no further since.
It is the second time this summer the Reds have rejected interest in the forward, having issued the same message to Barcelona earlier in the window.
Liverpool will not entertain any approaches for the Colombian, who has also been of interest to Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr this summer.
Liverpool executives view Diaz as pivotal for the coming seasons.
Diaz was a key part of Liverpool's Premier League title win last season as he scored 13 goals and provided five assists.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Joao Pedro joins Chelsea in time for Club World Cup last eight - why so many forwards?,Joao Pedro could play in Chelsea's Club World Cup quarter-final with Palmeiras after completing his move from Brighton.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg75j2118e3o,"Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:00:34",Ben Collins,['Chelsea'],"Joao Pedro has become the 18th forward to sign for Chelsea in just over three years under their current owners.
He joins from Brighton in a deal worth £60m, taking their total spending on attackers in that period to £560m.
And the 23-year-old could go straight in to the squad for Chelsea's Club World Cup quarter-final with Palmeiras on Saturday in Philadelphia.
Typically for a Blues signing, Joao Pedro has signed a long contract - eight years - although the club can no longer spread the cost of his transfer over the length of the deal after that loophole was closed by the Premier League.
The Fluminense youth product scored 30 goals in 70 games for Brighton after joining from Watford in 2023 for just under £30m, which at the time was a club record fee.
""Everyone knows this is a big club with a great history,"" he said. ""They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing - win.""
Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said it was a ""good move for all parties"".
""It's an excellent deal for the club, and a good return on a significant investment in an area of the pitch where we have a lot of competition and are already well served in terms of our attacking talent,"" he added.
""It's also an exciting move for Joao - it gives him the opportunity to play Champions League football this coming season, and he will of course be keen to cement his position in the Brazil team before the World Cup next summer.""
Chelsea's spending looks set to rise further. They have had a £55m bid for English winger Jamie Gittens, 20, accepted by Borussia Dortmund.
Why are Chelsea signing so many forwards?
Once Chelsea's move for Gittens goes through, they will have added Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap to an already strong attack featuring Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson, Pedro Neto, Noni Madueke, Christopher Nkunku, Marc Guiu and Tyrique George.
Estevao Willian is also joining the club after the Club World Cup as he prepares to face Chelsea with Palmeiras on Sunday.
It might feel as though Chelsea are almost doing deals just for the sake of it, but there is a specific plan.
The signing of Joao Pedro is expected to add competition for the number nine and 10 positions, with Nkunku expected to leave.
Gittens will come in as a left winger and replace Jadon Sancho after his loan spell from Manchester United was not made permanent. It's also worth noting Mykhailo Mudryk remains provisionally suspended for a failed drugs test.
Delap comes in to add competition for Jackson in the number nine position, with Chelsea having looked short up front last season.
Chelsea are not forcing any of the players in their Club World Cup squad out but could accept substantial offers for Madueke or Jackson, who are not deemed untouchable like Palmer is at Stamford Bridge.
It's worth noting Chelsea have eight attackers for four forward positions, but we haven't mentioned the likes of midfielders Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos, who often play as number 10s as well.
The prospect of loaning out Guiu and George, both 19, remains open. They played a substantial part in last season's Conference League campaign, but Chelsea need to strengthen the squad now they are back in the Champions League.
The likes of exiled attackers Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix and Armando Broja remain at the club and are available for sale.
How can Chelsea afford to keep spending?
Chelsea's deal for Joao Pedro takes their spending on initial transfer fees to £1.32bn in seven transfer windows, including this one, under their current ownership.
The expected arrival of Gittens would mean the club's outlay surpasses £1.5bn in three years once you include potential add-ons and Joao Felix's loan fee. Even taking into account sales, their net spend is £1.07bn.
Chelsea's gross and net spends were the most in the Premier League in their first three transfer windows under the current owners.
The club have been quiet in the past two winters but spent the most again last summer – though their net spend was only the seventh highest – and are on course to be the Premier League's biggest spenders once more ahead of the new season.
More than £560m, or 43%, of Chelsea's spending on guaranteed fees has been on 18 attacking players. Thirteen of those have made their debut for the Blues, with mixed returns so far.
By buying younger players on lower wages and spreading the payments over long-term contracts, Chelsea's strategy is to unearth new stars and sell on unwanted talent for a profit.
But their ability to further bolster their ranks may be determined by the Premier League's response to the sale of their women's team to parent company BlueCo for £198.7m - a process that put the wider business into profit.
This move gave them ""headroom"" under the Premier League spending rules, while Chelsea's finances are also being boosted by playing in next season's Champions League and the Club World Cup run.

'Joao Pedro is exactly what Chelsea need' - expert analysis
Edu Rubio, former West Ham, Crystal Palace and Wolves coach:
Some may wonder 'why this signing?' but for me, Joao Pedro is exactly what Chelsea need. He also falls into the category of young player with potential, to bring more revenue in a future sale, of course; but he is Premier League tested and proven, he is not a gamble.
He can come short, hold the ball and link up play to help the team with their attacks. He can offer Liam Delap space for forward runs, which will stretch the opposition and offer Chelsea more pockets and options in the final third.
Joao offers more of a much-needed presence in that final build-up than Nicolas Jackson. His ideal position is striker but he can also play as a false nine and offers Enzo Maresca more options.
His work off the ball and physicality will also support the style and DNA that Maresca is looking to build on in his second year at the helm. Joao's stats in penalty kicks, assists and open-play goals are also impressive. He definitely brings a new game dimension to Chelsea.
He has not gone past 11 league goals in a season so there might be a question mark there. Can he become a top player now that he is in a Champions League team?

Liverpool reject Bayern Munich approach for Diaz,"Liverpool reject a formal approach from Bayern Munich for Colombia forward Luis Diaz, who Barcelona also enquired about earlier this summer.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gejxk1rlyo,"Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:58:35",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have rejected a formal approach from Bayern Munich for forward Luis Diaz.
Bayern director of sport Max Eberl has been informed that the Premier League club have no intention of selling Diaz and will not enter into discussions for the attacker.
Diaz, 28, was the subject of a similar approach from Barcelona earlier this summer which the Premier League champions also rebuffed.
Liverpool are adamant that Diaz is not for sale at any price this summer, given his key contribution to the team since his arrival from Porto in 2022.
The Colombia international scored 22 goals for club and country last season as he emerged as an integral member of Arne Slot's title-winning side.
He scored 13 goals and made seven assists in the league as Liverpool won the title by 10 points.
Diaz, who has two years left to run on his contract at Anfield, attracted interest from Manchester City last summer and also has admirers in Saudi Arabia.
""I'm very happy at Liverpool - I've always said so,"" said Diaz when on international duty earlier this summer.
""The transfer market is opening, and we're trying to arrange what's best for us. I'm waiting to see what happens.
""If Liverpool give us a good extension or I have to see out my two-year contract, I'll be happy. It all depends on them. I'm here to decide and see what's best for us and the future.""
Meanwhile, Liverpool have confirmed former Netherlands international Giovanni van Bronckhorst will be joining the club as an assistant coach to manager Arne Slot.
Van Bronckhorst succeeds John Heitinga, who left the Premier League champions to become the head coach at Ajax.
Fifty-year-old Van Bronckhorst, who played in the Premier League for Arsenal, has managed Rangers, Besiktas and Feyenoord.
