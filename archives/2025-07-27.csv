Gyokeres wants to 'prove himself' after joining Arsenal,Arsenal have confirmed the signing of Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13401260/viktor-gyokeres-joins-arsenal-sporting-striker-completes-transfer-to-premier-league-club-signing-five-year-deal,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:00:00",,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have confirmed the signing of Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres.
The Gunners will pay the Portuguese club a £55m (€63m) guaranteed fee, plus £8.5m (€10m) in add-ons, with Gyokeres joining on a five-year deal.
Bringing in a striker has been a primary focus for Arsenal in this transfer window having explored conditions for several players, including RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
Gyokeres says he wants to ""prove himself for real"" in the Premier League, having shone in the Championship with Coventry before he moved to Sporting.
""I always want to score,"" he said after signing for Arsenal. ""To be a part of this club and to score in this kit and with this badge in front of all the supporters, I can't wait. It will be an amazing feeling.
""I started here [in England], it feels like a long time ago. I think I've improved a lot since then. Now I want to prove myself for real and perform together with the team.
""It's a big honour to play for your country, and then to score goals for them is amazing. When I played at Sporting, I scored a few goals in the Champions League so I feel that I can be on that level as well. Now to come here to a club on Arsenal's level, I think it's going to help me perform even better with all the amazing players in this team. I'm really excited to get going.""
Sky Sports News reported in June that Gyokeres was a Manchester United target after they made an initial approach for him through intermediaries.
Last month, Sporting president Frederico Varandas revealed Gyokeres would not be allowed to leave for less than £59m (€70m) this summer after disputing the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with the Swede's agent that would allow him to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m), plus £8.4m (€10m) in add ons.
After joining Sporting from Coventry City for around £20m in 2023, Gyokeres has scored an incredible 97 goals in just 102 matches during his two seasons in the Portuguese capital.
Gyokeres netted 54 goals in only 52 games in all competitions last campaign, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, as he helped Sporting win the league and the Portuguese Cup.
A move to Arsenal sees Gyokeres return to English football, having joined Brighton & Hove Albion in January 2018, before moving to Coventry after loan spells at St Pauli and Swansea City.
Gyokeres scored 43 goals for Coventry in his two-and-a-half seasons with the Championship side.
Coventry will receive just over £4m due to a 10 per cent sell-on clause and Brighton are also due a small amount for the deal they agreed when selling him.
Coventry's sell-on was originally 15 per cent but they sold five per cent of that back to Sporting last summer for an undisclosed amount.
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on signing Viktor Gyokeres:
""We're absolutely delighted to welcome Viktor Gyokeres to the club. The consistency he has shown in his performances and availability have been outstanding, and his goal contributions speak for themselves.
""Viktor has so many qualities. He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels.
""He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat.
""We're excited about what Viktor brings to our squad and are looking forward to start working with him. We welcome Viktor and his family to Arsenal.""
Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta on signing Viktor Gyokeres:
""We are so pleased with the excellent deal we have completed to bring Viktor Gyokeres to the club.
""Viktor is an exceptional talent and has consistently demonstrated he has the qualities and winning mentality required of a top-level centre-forward.
""His physicality, intelligence and work ethic make him a perfect fit for our vision.
""We are confident Viktor will have a major impact on the pitch and become an important figure in our dressing room. Welcome, Viktor!""
For years, the football world called for Arsenal to sign a striker and the Gunners have finally responded.
The move is set to be a standout one for the Premier League - no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting last season and it could herald the arrival of another elite goalscorer for the division.
But it is even more significant for Arsenal, given their spending under Mikel Arteta.

'Physical machine' Gyokeres - Arsenal's missing piece or a gamble up front?,"For years, the football world called for Arsenal to sign a striker and the Gunners have finally responded. Viktor Gyokeres has arrived at the Emirates.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13394339/viktor-gyokeres-to-arsenal-sporting-cp-striker-is-a-physical-machine-but-is-he-really-the-forward-to-guide-the-gunners-to-glory,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:00:00",Sam Blitz,['Arsenal'],"For years, the football world called for Arsenal to sign a striker and the Gunners have finally responded. Viktor Gyokeres has arrived at the Emirates.
The move is a standout one for the Premier League - no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting last season and it could herald the arrival of another elite goalscorer for the division.
But it is even more significant for Arsenal, given their spending under Mikel Arteta.
Before this summer, just £75m went towards players who naturally play in the front three, since Arteta took over. The majority of that sum went on Gabriel Jesus' £45m transfer from Manchester City in 2023, with Leandro Trossard the only other major outlay in that department.
There was also an additional £65m spent on Kai Havertz but the German initially started out as an attacking midfielder for Arsenal, before transitioning into the centre forward role.
In these contexts, Arsenal signing Gyokeres and moving for the £52m-rated Noni Madueke makes sense on paper. Not only are the Gunners investing in an area where they need more quality and numbers - Jesus is out for the rest of this year with injury - but in Gyokeres, they are also bringing in a natural centre forward, which Havertz has never really been.
There is also Gyokeres' previous experience of English football, via his successful stint at Coventry where he scored 40 goals in 97 matches. ""He really was incredible,"" Adi Viveash, who coached and mentored the striker there, tells Sky Sports.
""His power, taking the ball and running with it, bursting through gaps, linking the play, being very good in both boxes set-piece-wise - which wasn't a strength of his, but he became certainly very good at defensive set-pieces with me through front post defending.""
He sounds like an Arsenal player. Except that compared to the options in Arteta's squad, he's not. On top of his profile of being a natural No 9, he's very different stylistically to what the Gunners have.
Viveash describes Gyokeres as ""a physical machine"" and others have referred to him as a 'battering ram'. One diverse area of his skillset, compared to Arsenal's options, is his ability to carry the ball great distances.
Gyokeres ranked third in the Portuguese top-flight last season for progressive carries up the pitch, which is particularly impressive given ball-playing defenders tend to dominate these metrics across Europe.
Compared to Arsenal's strikers, his running ability is another level. In terms of progressing their team forwards, Havertz and Jesus managed 40m and 48m respectively per 90. Gyokeres progressed Sporting by 53m per game - more than half the length of the pitch.
""His ability to run and keep running and keep running and keep running is the thing that set him apart in the Championship,"" adds Viveash.
""The strikers at other teams, they could produce three or four brilliant runs, but he would do 12, 13, 14.""
It is particularly important given the way Arsenal attacked last season. They had the sixth-lowest shots from fast breaks last season and really struggled to turn defence to attack quickly.
Signing a centre forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - he scored 23 goals from fast breaks last season - can help fix these dilemmas.
""If two or three defenders came to try and take the ball off him, his mentality was: I'll just run through all of you and that's the way that he is,"" remembers Matty Godden, who played with him at Coventry, speaking to Sky Sports.
Gyokeres also enjoys making runs in behind, with Havertz and Jesus not blessed with the forward's burning pace and power to test backlines.
""If you give Vik half a pitch in behind with a high line and you get the line wrong, you're never going to catch him,"" adds Viveash. ""He's going to keep making the run in behind so you're wearing down opposition.""
At Arsenal, Gyokeres won't always have that luxury of space to burn into - given the Premier League title challengers are often tasked with breaking down a low block.
That was also a challenge Gyokeres faced at Coventry, once the Championship worked out his talents. ""Obviously in the end, the defensive lines dropped,"" recalls Viveash.
""I used to do a lot of work with him in tight areas because when he got on a pitch with full grass [to run into], it was easier for him. It took a lot of cajoling to get him to understand and buy into that.""
It was not the only area of disagreement involving Gyokeres at Coventry. While the Swedish forward arrived at the Sky Blues as an out-of-confidence forward following failed spells at Brighton and Swansea, he developed into a top goalscorer that nearly drove Coventry to the Premier League - so an ego emerged.
""Vik would want to do training sessions to be the way Vik wanted to work,"" remembers Viveash.
""He wanted to do finishing at a certain time, he wanted to do this, he wanted to do that. He had a strong character, strong personality and when you get two of you like that, then you have to find a way of communicating.
""And you'd butt heads at times, for the good of each other really, but he certainly understood his worth as time went on."" The manner of his Sporting departure - a refusal to turn up for pre-season to force through a move - has similar tones.
It would be interesting to see how Arteta would manage that type of temperament, should it appear again.
And there are other doubts when it comes to Gyokeres. For all of his excellent attacking numbers in Portugal, they are still under the microscope.
Opta rank the Primeira Division as the eighth-best league in the world in terms of quality. The Premier League is top, but Portugal's top-flight even sits below England's second tier, where Gyokeres plied his trade before his move to Sporting.
On top of that, over half of his 27 non-penalty goals were against the Primeira Division's bottom four teams.
Portugal's best striker moving to one of England's top clubs has also been done recently in the case of Darwin Nunez, who scored 26 league goals in his final season at Benfica before joining Liverpool for a huge fee. The same forward has not even hit 26 league goals in three full seasons at Anfield combined.
Some will argue Gyokeres created a bigger splash than Nunez in Portugal, while also pointing to Evanilson's positive move from Porto to Bournemouth last season, plus Raul Jimenez's impact at Wolves after joining from Benfica as positive examples of Portugal-based forwards doing well in the Premier League.
But neither of those players came with the expectations and the backdrop that Gyokeres currently has at Arsenal.
Many have attributed Arsenal's failed title races to the lack of a centre forward and while the Gunners have signed players like Martin Zubimendi and are targeting other high-profile names such as Eberechi Eze, there is no doubt who will have the biggest spotlight on them this summer.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

The Swedish club with 'no fans' but a giant academy making stars like Gyokeres,"Viktor Gyokeres is adapting to unfamiliar surroundings at Arsenal but he shares common ground with two of his new neighbours in north London. Like Tottenham's Dejan Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall, he is a product of IF Brommapojkarna.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396519/viktor-gyokeres-arsenals-new-signing-is-a-graduate-of-if-brommapojkarna-the-swedish-club-with-no-fans-but-europes-biggest-academy,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:00:00",Nick Wright,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Viktor Gyokeres is adapting to unfamiliar surroundings at Arsenal but he shares common ground with two of his new neighbours in north London. Like Tottenham's Dejan Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall, he is a product of IF Brommapojkarna.
Gyokeres, Kulusevski and Bergvall are leading graduates of their youth set-up but there are hundreds more scattered across the continent. This tiny Swedish club, who struggle to fill a 5,000-capacity stadium, are said to have the biggest academy in Europe.
""We have no fans, really,"" sporting director Philip Berglund tells Sky Sports. It is quite the opening gambit. ""Our stadium is very small, ticket income is pretty bad, and it's hard to compete commercially as the bigger clubs in Stockholm take all the sponsors.""
Instead, Brommapojkarna unashamedly focus their efforts on one thing and one thing only: the development of young players who can be sold for as much money as possible. ""Everything we do is built to generate income through transfers,"" adds Berglund.
That includes having a sprawling network of young players.
From the age of eight up, they have roughly as many academy players as they do seats in their Grimsta IP stadium. Most play for affiliated grassroots sides, where they get Brommapojkarna coaching and vie for spots in the 'prestige teams' based at the club's headquarters.
Those teams typically dominate their domestic leagues. ""In Sweden's highest U17 league, for example, we currently have one team in first place and another in second,"" says Berglund. They routinely beat prestigious opponents in continental tournaments too.
The aim is for the best of the best to rise through the club's youth ranks and eventually gain first-team exposure, which is why Brommapojkarna officials celebrated when, having previously bounced between divisions, they clinched a club-record third successive season in Sweden's Allsvenskan top-flight last year.
""Of course, we want to improve our first team and finish as high in the table as possible, but that's not the main purpose,"" says Berglund. ""The main purpose of establishing ourselves in the Allsvenskan is so we can put a lot of young players on the pitch at the top level to increase their value.""
That in turn helps Berglund fulfil his stated remit when he arrived from Hammarby, one of the three bigger clubs based in the Swedish capital along with AIK and Djurgardens, in 2022.
""I came in in the year we came up from the second division with the main goal of starting to sell players for more money than the club had done before,"" explains Berglund.
""It helps now to be in the top division because we can sell to big European clubs directly instead of selling to other clubs in Sweden, which is what we have previously done.""
Bergvall, once a prized academy product at Brommapojkarna, is a case in point. The club secured a 20 per cent sell-on clause when they sold him to Djurgardens three years ago but it was their rivals who profited most when he joined Tottenham for £8.5m last summer.
""When we sold Lucas we had just got promoted,"" says Berglund. ""He only had one year left on his contract so we needed a deal with a good sell-on clause for him to join a top team in Sweden who win a lot of games three-nil and four-nil and can just put in young players.
""Compare that to us at the time, we were having to fight for every game, to get the points in order to say in the division, so the conditions were not ideal for young players to really shine.""
Gyokeres, who came later to Brommapojkarna's academy than Bergvall, aged 14, from another small club in Stockholm called IFK Aspudden-Tellus, was a different case given he was sold directly to a European team in Brighton, moving to England aged 19 in 2018.
But the fee, for a player now valued at over £60m, was modest at under £1m, in part because Gyokeres had not had the chance to prove himself in the top division with Brommapojkarna, who were playing in Sweden's third and second tiers at the time of his first-team emergence.
Fast forward to now and the benefit of being settled in Sweden's top-tier - Brommapojkarna rose from 14th in the season after their promotion to 10th last term and now sit ninth - can be seen in the club-record sale of 17-year-old midfielder Love Arrhov to Eintracht Frankfurt announced in May.
In the stable conditions of mid-table, Arrhov has been able to shine for Brommapojkarna, with Frankfurt not only agreeing to pay a fee which could reach eight-figure territory in euros if add-ons are met, but delay his arrival until January, ensuring his boyhood club retain an important player for the remainder of the Swedish season, which runs from March to November.
The profits from his sale, Berglund explains, will be reinvested in the club's youth operations. ""It's really important for the club that when we sell someone, we don't use all that money to buy older first-team players. Instead, we reinvest in the whole club and the grassroots.""
That investment is key but the productivity of their academy is at least partly down to the sheer volume of players enrolled. They have established a monopoly on young talent in the Stockholm area having been one of the first clubs in Scandinavia to start running academy teams for players as young as eight.
The quality of the coaching and footballing education offered is of course another factor. The club are also careful to ensure alignment between their academy and senior sides. Their U17 and U19 coaches double as first-team assistants to help players make the step up.
Their success has made them a hugely attractive destination to young players. ""If you are the best player of your age in Stockholm, you basically always want to play for Bromma,"" says Berglund.
But their methods have raised questions in the country too.
In 2019, the Stockholm-based newspaper Aftonbladet published a series of articles in which journalist Patrik Brenning revealed many parents were paying disproportionately high costs to enrol their children at the club and access additional services such as specialist coaching and training camps.
""The idea is that it can help their kids fulfil their dream of playing in the Allsvekan, the Premier League or for the Swedish national team,"" Brenning tells Sky Sports, ""but the reality is that so few of them will, which raises the question, is it fair to sell a dream you know is unreachable?""
Brommapojkarna can for their part point to a lengthy list of players who have made it from their academy to the top level, with the Frankfurt-bound Arrhov just the latest example.
As well as Gyokeres, Kulusevski and Bergvall, the club count former Arsenal winger Anders Limpar, former Manchester City and Celta Vigo striker John Guidetti and ex-Juventus and Sampdoria midfielder Albin Ekdal among their most high-profile graduates.
But the percentages are of course vanishingly small, as they are for academy players in England and across Europe. The club do acknowledge the issues raised by Brenning.
""We now have a ceiling on how much parents can pay each year and the total can't go over that,"" says Berglund. ""All our teams also have their own bank accounts, so if they want to go to extra tournaments or things like that, they need to find sponsors to pay.
""We never want a family to not be able to afford to be here. It's really important to us that everybody who wants to play football can play football. Of course, our players don't all come from rich families, so we also take the responsibility to sponsor specific players as well.""
Brommapojkarna were regarded as trailblazers in youth development in Sweden but they are far from the only club now trying to generate profit through high-potential players as a priority.
Brenning likens the scramble to recruit the best talents in Stockholm to an ""arm's race"". In May, Alexander Andersson, a player poached from Brommapojkarna by Djurgardens, set a record as the youngest player to feature in the Allsvenskan at 15 years and 24 days old.
Some in the country believe the priority given to young talents over experienced players is taking a toll on the national team. Despite a growing number of clubs developing better, or at least more sellable, young players, Sweden have only qualified for one of the last four major tournaments.
For Brommapojkarna, though, the success stories will keep coming.
They have secured a record-breaking windfall through Arrhov but he is not the only member of their current side to have attracted interest, with 19-year-old striker Ezekiel Alladoh, scorer of four goals so far this season, also expected to fetch a big fee.
In Gyokeres and his new neighbours Kulusevski and Bergvall over in north London, they and the many thousands of other young players on Brommapojkarna's books have their inspiration.

Arsenal's striker hunt is over - but what will Gyokeres bring?,Viktor Gyokeres has signed for Arsenal but what are the Swede's attributes?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjrljv22d53o,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 18:19:23",Andy Cryer,['Arsenal'],"""Arsenal just need to sign a striker.""
It's probably a phrase manager Mikel Arteta is sick of hearing.
While it would be far too simplistic to say the Gunners' five-year trophy drought is down to their failure to land a frontman, it has undoubtedly played a part.
Well, now they have one.
Viktor Gyokeres will arrive at the Emirates with a big reputation, having scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting, and adding 26 assists.
He will be the latest signing in a busy summer for Arteta, who has already recruited midfielders Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard, goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and winger Noni Madueke, while he will also add Valencia centre-back Cristhian Mosquera.
That would all take Arsenal's summer spending to £210m - the most spent in one transfer window during Arteta's tenure.
But, as they attempt to win their first trophy since the FA Cup in 2020 and look to improve on three successive second-place finishes in the Premier League, the arrival of Gyokeres will be the most exciting for Gunners fans.
Could the 27-year-old former Brighton and Coventry striker be the man to bring silverware back to the Emirates?
How much did Arsenal need a striker?
Anyone glancing at the Premier League table may question why there has been so much focus on Arsenal's need to sign a striker.
They were the third-highest scorers last season as they again proved the closest challengers to the champions - this time, Liverpool.
But that doesn't tell the whole story.
Arsenal scored 22 fewer goals in the league last season than they did in 2023-24.
That lack of cutting edge contributed to them falling well behind Liverpool and also meant they were unable to turn possession into goals as they were knocked out of the Champions League in the semi-finals by Paris St-Germain.
As former Manchester City defender Micah Richards told BBC Sport last season: ""The difference between Arsenal winning the league or winning these ties is just a centre-forward.""
Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Newcastle's Alexander Isak are three of the strikers the Gunners have explored moves for in recent times.
But some Arsenal supporters will argue they have been screaming out for a new forward since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left the club in 2022. He was their last 20-goals-a-season striker in the league - back in the 2019-20 season.
Kai Havertz was the Gunners' top scorer in the Premier League last season - his nine goals put him joint 26th in the standings.
He added six in other competitions, but 15 is still some way short of what would be expected from a striker in a team fighting for multiple trophies.
Before Gyokeres, the only two recognised strikers Arteta had recruited were Gabriel Jesus and Havertz - both of whom can play other roles but do have plenty of experience leading the line.
To put that in context, Arsenal's four summer signings to date prior to Gyokeres took Arteta's recruitment to 35 players - either permanently or on loan - in five seasons. Kepa is the sixth goalkeeper he has brought in.
Winger Leandro Trossard and midfielder Mikel Merino have both played up front at times, but that was largely as a result of injuries to Jesus and Havertz and underlined his lack of options.
Is Gyokeres the answer?
Goalscoring is Gyokeres' most obvious attribute, and there is no doubt he has been a goal machine in Portugal.
His 39 goals ranked as the most in Europe's top 10 leagues last season, and he scored at least eight more than any other player.
It put him in an elite group - the only other players in the past 20 years to have scored at least 39 goals in a season in one of Europe's top 10 leagues are Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Robert Lewandowski and Luis Suarez.
Twelve of Gyokeres' Primeira Liga goals were penalties, but his total of 27 non-penalty goals was still three more than anyone else. He averaged 4.5 shots per 90 minutes, while Jesus had 3.0 and Havertz 2.6 in the Premier League.
He also had a mammoth 327 touches in the opposition box and appeared to adopt a 'shoot on sight' policy with 139 efforts on goal - effectively one every 20 minutes.
His accuracy was even more impressive.
The Swede's shot-conversion rate (excluding blocked shots and penalties) of 27.3% was better than Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah (21.1%), Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (21.6%) and Newcastle centre-forward Isak (26.4%).
Indeed only Nottingham Forest's Chris Wood had a better conversion rate in the Premier League.
Gyokeres also scored nine goals in six games for his country - including four in one match against Azerbaijan - in the 2024-25 Nations League, finishing the tournament as top scorer.
The question is whether Gyokeres can be quite so prolific in a stronger league. He has now turned 27 and is still to play a single game in Europe's top five divisions.
Data analysts Opta rank the Portuguese Primeira Liga as eighth in the world's strongest leagues,, external behind the usual big five (England, Italy, Spain, Germany and France), the Belgian Jupiler Pro League and even the English Championship, where Gyokeres impressed before moving to Lisbon.
Sceptics will point to Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez struggling for consistency in England after scoring 26 goals in 28 Primeira Liga games for Benfica during the 2021-22 season.
But Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes, Manchester City's Ruben Dias and Bournemouth's Evanilson have all thrived in the Premier League after moves from Portugal.
And Gyokeres brings more than goals.
The 6ft 2in striker is known for his intelligent movement and intense work-rate, and his blend of physical strength, technical skill and tactical awareness have earned him admiring glances.
He is a creator as well as a goalscorer, with a lot of his chance creation coming from his love of running with the ball.
After failing to make the grade at Brighton, Gyokeres joined Coventry for a small fee in July 2021 after an unspectacular return of three goals in 19 Championship appearances during a loan spell with the Sky Blues.
Two years later he went to Sporting for £20.5m after scoring 38 times in 91 league games for Coventry across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons.
In Portugal he became a scoring machine. As he returns to England, only time will tell if he can replicate that success against elite-level defences.

'Losing 5-1 to Arsenal made me want to join' - Gyokeres seals £64m move,Viktor Gyokeres says he decided to sign for Arsenal after the Gunners thrashed his Sporting side in last season's Champions League.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c860l3d10j6o,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 18:05:24",Alex Brotherton,['Arsenal'],"Viktor Gyokeres says he decided to sign for Arsenal after the Gunners thrashed his Sporting side 5-1 in the Champions League last season.
The 27-year-old Sweden striker has joined Arsenal in a deal worth up to 73m euros (£64m) on a five-year contract.
The move was held up because of negotiations between the clubs over additional payments, with the final agreement consisting of a 63m euro initial fee plus 10m euros in add-ons.
Gyokeres was in the Sporting side dismantled by Mikel Arteta's team in the group stage of Europe's top competition in November.
""I just felt it was the right club for me,"" said Gyokeres. ""What I heard from Mikel and [sporting director] Andrea Berta and just what I've seen in the past years, how they've been playing football.
""When I played against Arsenal last season, I could really feel it was a very strong team and very difficult to play against.
""That made me choose Arsenal, and of course all the history the club has and the massive fan base.""
The move takes Arsenal's summer spending up to about £204m, following the arrivals of Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard, Noni Madueke and Cristhian Mosquera.
""Viktor has so many qualities. He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels,"" said Gunners boss Arteta.
""He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat.
""We're excited about what Viktor brings to our squad and are looking forward to starting working with him.""
BBC Sport revealed at the start of the month how Arteta's side had turned their attentions to Gyokeres after hitting an impasse in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.
Gunners sporting director Andrea Berta flew to Lisbon to lead negotiations with the Portuguese club.
The deal concludes the long-running saga over Gyokeres' future, after he was linked with Manchester United earlier this summer.
Gyokeres failed to report back at Sporting for pre-season earlier this month, and the club's president Frederico Varandas said the player would face disciplinary action.
Who is Viktor Gyokeres?
The former Brighton and Coventry striker has scored 97 goals in 102 matches and contributed 26 assists during his two seasons in Portugal to help Sporting claim two league titles.
Gyokeres returns to England on the back of a season in which he scored 54 goals in 52 games, including in the final of the Portuguese Cup as Sporting defeated Benfica 3-1.
The Swede also scored six times in the Champions League last season - including a hat-trick against Manchester City.
Gyokeres made his professional debut in 2015 in his native Sweden for IF Brommapojkarna.
By September 2017, he had caught the eye of newly promoted Premier League side Brighton and agreed a two-year contract with the Seagulls, officially joining the following January.
While still playing for Brighton's youth team, he made his debut for Sweden in January 2019 in a defeat by Finland. He scored his first international goal three days later in a 2-2 draw with Iceland.
However he still struggled for opportunities with Brighton and was sent on loan to German second-tier side St Pauli for the 2019-20 season.
It was at the Hamburg club where he began to thrive, scoring seven goals in 26 appearances.
A month into the following season, Gyokeres scored his only Brighton goal - finding the net in a 4–0 League Cup victory over Portsmouth.
Nevertheless, weeks later he was loaned to Championship side Swansea City.
He played 12 times and managed one goal for the Swans during three months in Wales before being recalled by Brighton and sent on loan to Coventry City in January 2021.
Gyokeres scored three goals in the second half of the season, including his first league goal in English football, and made his move permanent that summer at the age of 23.
During the next two seasons he would become one of the most prolific strikers in the Championship, scoring 43 goals in 116 appearances.
In 2022-23 he was named in the Championship team of the year as Coventry reached the play-off final, but were beaten on penalties by Luton Town.
That summer he moved to Portugal, signing for the Lisbon-based club for about £20m.

Isak situation has to be right for Newcastle - Howe,"The settling of Alexander Isak's future ""has to be right for Newcastle"", manager Eddie Howe says, as the striker considers his future amid interest from Liverpool.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cdxyln4qrv2o,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 08:29:46",Alex Howell,['Liverpool'],"The settling of Alexander Isak's future ""has to be right for Newcastle"", says manager Eddie Howe.
The striker is considering his future at the club amid interest from Liverpool.
Isak did not travel with the squad to Singapore on Thursday, with Newcastle saying he had a thigh injury, but the Sweden international wants to look at a move.
A source has told BBC Sport that Liverpool are still interested in the 25-year-old, despite signing Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike for an initial £69m.
Speaking before Sunday's pre-season friendly against Arsenal, Howe said: ""Of course there are things going on behind the scenes.
""He will be aware he is in the news every day and I'm sure that is not easy for anyone in that situation. Conversations that happen with Alex and the club, or Alex and myself, will stay private for obvious reasons.
""We do share a good relationship. He has been magnificent for us since he joined. He's very popular in the dressing room.
""We would love him to continue his journey at Newcastle. Although, whatever happens has to be right for Newcastle.""
Isak, signed from Real Sociedad in August 2022 for around £60m, has a contract until June 2028. He scored 27 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions for Newcastle last season.
Last Saturday, after Isak missed a 4-0 friendly defeat by Celtic, Howe said the player would ""absolutely"" be part of the squad for the games in Singapore and South Korea.
Howe says Isak is in Newcastle having his injury assessed, adding: ""Hopefully he'll be back soon and playing in the black and white shirt. That's what we all want to see.""
He added: ""He first mentioned his thigh before the Celtic game. We assumed it would be a very minimal injury, nothing too serious. I think on Monday after the Celtic game, he went in for training very early and he didn't feel right.""
Howe said he has not yet had direct contact Newcastle's board about Isak's future, but added that any contract talks would take place ""at a later date"".
""The manager of course has an opinion but ultimately the decision will rest with the board,"" he said.
Asked if Isak would stay, he added: ""I said after the Celtic game I certainly hope he stays and I said I was confident he would stay.
""I don't see anything that will change that opinion of mine at the moment - but it's football and who knows what the future may bring?
""We are in a very strong position financially.
""We are determined to be successful, be ambitious. We have got a great season ahead of us and we need to add to the squad and continue to improve. The journey will continue in an upward trajectory and that's what we all want.""

Hojlund's fight to answer Man Utd's striker question,Manchester United have been linked with a host of strikers over the summer -but Rasmus Hojlund has a chance to prove he can fill the number nine role.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g6e722v99o,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 10:26:19",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Rasmus Hojlund is about to face a match at the stadium that will host next year's World Cup final.
Manchester United's friendly with West Ham at MetLife Stadium, in the grand scheme of things, is nowhere near as big a deal. But for the Danish striker, it's crucial.
A crowd approaching 50,000 is anticipated for United's opening game in the four-team Premier League Summer Series on Saturday evening, just west of New York City.
Hojlund's performance could determine whether head coach Ruben Amorim keeps faith with him as United's attacking spearhead.
United have spent more than £120m on forward players this summer - but three weeks before the start of the new Premier League season, do not have the number nine many informed observers believe they are desperate for.
They were frustrated in their efforts to sign Liam Delap - who left Ipswich for Chelsea instead. And on Friday, Amorim hinted Hojlund remains his first choice for the role.
Is he up to the task?
In May, United finished 15th in the Premier League, their worst final placing since relegation from the top flight in 1974. A Europa League final defeat by Tottenham compounded the disappointment.
Vast improvement has to come - Amorim accepts as much.
And for that to happen, his side must score more goals. They managed only 44 in the league last season.
The week before last, minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe met chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox in Iceland. It is probably fair to assume the centre-forward position was discussed.
And there is no doubt they wanted Delap. United have been targeting the domestic market because Amorim is keen to add players who do not need time to adapt to the Premier League. But Chelsea sealed the deal.
Since then, the names of numerous alternatives have been advanced.
Viktor Gyokeres was thought of as a target from the moment Amorim was appointed, given how successful the pair were together at Sporting after the 27-year-old had impressed in the Championship with Coventry.
But Gyokeres is heading to Arsenal.
Nicolas Jackson's name keeps being mentioned in connection with United. There have been conversations about the Chelsea forward, but not to the point where it has looked as if United might try to buy him.
Aston Villa quickly shut down a link to their forward Ollie Watkins, letting it be known they have no interest in selling. Could United put that to the test?
Watkins is an interesting case because he slipped down the pecking order at Villa when Marcus Rashford - unwanted by Amorim - arrived on loan.
Would a more expensive Watkins, 29, who has scored 75 goals in 184 Premier League games be a better option that a cheaper Jackson, who has been excellent and erratic at Chelsea, often both in the same game?
Man Utd to need to raise funds
Former Everton striker Moise Kean, who re-established his reputation in Serie A with Fiorentina, Randal Kolo Muani, back at Paris St-Germain and unwanted after a loan spell with Juventus, and Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta are all likely to be available.
The same is true of RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, although Newcastle is a more likely destination for the Slovenian.
Then there are the wildcard options - out-of-contract forwards such as Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jamie Vardy.
But none of these options come without risk. And for United, funds are limited and there are so many weaknesses to address.
Amorim referred to the need for more energy in midfield after last Saturday's 0-0 draw with Leeds in Stockholm.
Amorim didn't mention the additional issues, but others have: Goalkeeper, central defence, the right-sided wing-back role. The list goes on.
Not all of this can be dealt with in a single transfer window. It is quite possible 12 months from now, if he is still in post, Amorim will still be looking to address flaws that exist now, as well as those that emerge in the coming months.
Funds are precious and United need to raise some.
They might have generated around £30m this summer through sell-ons being activated for Alvaro Carreras, who has left Benfica for Real Madrid, Anthony Elanga joining Newcastle and Maxi Oyedele moving to Strasbourg - plus the covering of Rashford's wages for the season by his loan move to Barcelona - but more needs to be done.
Rashford was one of five unwanted players effectively cast out of the first-team picture by Amorim - the other four being Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. More money could be generated by selling those four - but Amorim has warned that they won't be allowed to leave on the cheap.
Garnacho is a player capable of generating a sizeable fee - albeit not the £60m United went into the summer hoping for. He may be pivotal, especially if Chelsea go back for a player they were close to signing in January.
But for now, Amorim has to maximise what he has.
The case for sticking with Hojlund
Against Leeds in Sweden, 18-year-old Chido Obi started. But the former Arsenal youngster currently appears to be an impact player.
Hojlund took over for the second half. As usual, he worked hard enough, didn't receive the service a centre-forward would want and did his best for the team.
But, as usual, he didn't score. He has scored 26 goals in 95 competitive appearances over two years at United - just over a goal every four games.
The numbers are not terrible. But they include a run of five goals in four games last season and eight in eight the campaign before. Statistics can be manipulated to suit any argument - but if those two sequences are taken out, what is left is 13 goals in 83 appearances, or more than six games for every goal. That is clearly not good enough.
The question is whether Hojlund can extend the more productive spells or if they are distorting the overall picture.
On Friday, Amorim gave the impression he has not given up on the 22-year-old, who cost United £72m when they bought him from Serie A outfit Atalanta in 2023.
In his opening media engagement of the summer in Chicago, United's head coach made a couple of significant points.
Firstly, he insisted he would be happy to go into the new season with his current squad. In truth, he couldn't say anything else given there are no guarantees of further signings.
Secondly, he confirmed his belief that his attacking reinforcements, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, could both operate as a spearhead in addition to the number 10 roles they appear best suited to.
But it was towards the end of a long unrelated answer, in connection to captain Bruno Fernandes, that Amorim might have given an indication about his thinking.
The coach wants Fernandes to operate deeper, away from those two prized number 10 spots. He thinks the Portuguese can cause more damage that way because he won't be marked as tightly.
""If you have the threat of players; of Rasmus, Matheus and Brian, in the space and a player with Bruno's quality on the ball, it's really important,"" he said.
Events can change course quickly at Old Trafford but at the very least, the namecheck suggested Hojlund is likely to get some time on the pitch with Cunha, Mbeumo and Fernandes at the MetLife and beyond.
And if he finds a spark across a trio of pre-season fixtures against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton over the next nine days, it may cause United's hierarchy to pause and think.
To a greater or lesser degree, the search for a striker has been a feature of their summer.
Can Hojlund prove he is the answer after all?

Liverpool plan Jota memorial sculpture at Anfield,Liverpool announce plans for a permanent memorial sculpture at Anfield in tribute to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn84lrpjzp8o,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 10:47:29",Sarah Rendell,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have announced plans for a permanent memorial sculpture at Anfield in tribute to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva.
A ""Forever 20"" emblem will also be printed on players' shirts next season.
Portugal and Liverpool forward Jota and Silva, who played for Portuguese second division club Penafiel, died in a car crash on 3 July in the Spanish province of Zamora.
Liverpool retired his number 20 shirt in tribute.
The planned sculpture will be made by recycling items left outside Anfield since his death by fans paying their respects.
Liverpool are planning a fan mosaic and a minute's silence at the opening Premier League home game against Bournemouth on 15 August.
Fans can also pay tribute at the pre-season game against Atletico Bilbao on 4 August at Anfield, while players' shirts will have a ""'Diogo J 20"" patch for their two pre-season games in Asia.
In addition, the club have said if supporters want to honour Jota by having ""Diogo J 20"" on the back of their shirts, then the profits of the purchases will go to the LFC Foundation, the club's charity.
The LFC Foundation has also committed to creating a grassroots football programme in the Jota's name.
Meanwhile, the Football Association will hold talks with Liverpool before planning a tribute to Jota at the Community Shield at Wembley on 10 August.

The man behind the mask: why Viktor Gyökeres’s celebration keeps the game guessing,Arsenal’s soon-to-be hotshot arrives with a reputation for goals but also mystery around his iconic celebration,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/27/viktor-gyokeres-arsenal-celebration-transfer,"Sun, 27 Jul 2025 08:00:17",David Hytner,['Arsenal'],"Every goalscorer needs a trademark celebration and the one Viktor Gyökeres has shown off over the past few years has certainly increased its reach of late – fingers interlocked, thumbs pushed up, a mask formed across his mouth and nose.
As Gyökeres’s transfer from Sporting to Arsenal has edged along, fans of the London club became increasingly desperate for clues. They were convinced they spotted one when the defender, Riccardo Calafiori, was pictured at their kit launch with the shirt pulled up towards his eyes; mask-style. And then there was Myles Lewis-Skelly, another of their defenders, looking at a Gyökeres-to-Arsenal story on his phone and copying the gesture.
What does it mean? There is a theory that it owes its inspiration to a line from the Tom Hardy character, Bane, in The Dark Knight Rises film. “No-one cared who I was till I put on the mask,” he says. Is it Gyökeres’s way of making a point to the doubters – and there have been a few of those along what has been an unconventional career path?
“No,” he told reporters in 2023 after a Sweden game. “That’s a good guess but you’re completely wrong. You can have another guess the next time you interview me.”
Why the secrecy, Viktor? “I don’t know,” he replied. “It’s fun when you guess wrong so I’ll keep doing it.”
Seriously, though, it has to be to silence the critics? “No, it’s not that, either. Now you’ve had two guesses and you have to stop. You can say it right once but I’ll say it was wrong.”
Gyökeres’s manager at Coventry, Mark Robins, was once asked to explain it. “I know what it means,” he said. “Has he not told you? I won’t be revealing it then.” And it is fair to say Gyökeres stirred the pot – and took delight in doing so – when he captioned an Instagram post in June of last year with a virtual re-quote of Hardy/Bane. “Nobody cared until I put on the mask,” he wrote.
Plainly, he thrives on keeping people guessing, especially defenders, and the whole shemozzle advertises more than the twinkle he has in his eye; the innate confidence of a showman. The 27-year-old appears keen to create a sense of mystique as he strives to become the best, an icon. And when it comes to Gyökeres, mystery is certainly a part of it.
There is a brilliant clip of him from his time at Sporting when an interviewer asks how it is that people around Europe do not know of his talent. “They don’t?” Gyökeres shoots back.
It talks to the curiosity fans have in general with regard to late bloomers. Gyökeres has never made an appearance in one of Europe’s so-called “big five” leagues. Apart from his two seasons with Sporting in the Primeira Liga, he has always played below the top division in various countries – in Sweden’s second and third tiers with IF Brommapojkarna (BP, for short); the Premier League 2 with Brighton under-23s; the Bundesliga 2 with St Pauli; the Championship with Swansea and Coventry.
Gyökeres was spectacular at Sporting, scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances. He won back-to-back league titles, back-to-back Golden Boots and the Portuguese Cup in his second season. He did well in his first Champions League campaign last time out, playing in all eight of Sporting’s group stage ties and scoring six goals, the highlight being the hat-trick in the 4-1 win over Manchester City. Is the sample size large enough to justify Arsenal’s £63.7m move for him?
It is the jeopardy of the step up to the Premier League that enthrals and Gyökeres has been here before, albeit at a formative stage of his development. He was 19 when he went from BP to Brighton in January 2018 on the back of a breakout 2017; the seasons run on calendar years in Sweden. A regular for BP, he helped them to promotion from the second tier, scoring 13 goals and providing eight assists.
At Brighton, then managed by Chris Hughton, there were a handful of cup appearances over the 18 months that followed but Gyökeres played mainly for the under-23s. He was an unused substitute on three occasions in the Premier League. Gyökeres had been turned from a winger into a central striker at BP – he went there on a full-time basis at 16 from his first club, Aspudden-Tellus, in Stockholm – but he alternated between playing on the left and up top at Brighton.
“I like Viktor,” Hughton says. “He had a great desire to want to do well; very driven. If you ask me did I see what he is now back then, I would probably say no. But it was nothing to do with the boy’s attitude, his work ethic. Football was very much his life. He was a good pro.
“It was almost more of a positional one. At the time, there was that question – is he going to be better as a nine or a wider player? He actually did well in that wider area in a 4-3-3, mostly on the left. Because he is a runner with and without the ball. Once he gets it he likes to drive. He’s prepared to run forward with and without.”
Gyökeres reached Coventry on an initial loan in January 2021 after a season at St Pauli in 2019-20 and three months at Swansea – both loans. He played an important role in helping St Pauli avoid relegation; they stayed in Germany’s second division by two points. But Swansea was more of a struggle. He started only two league games for them, his only goal coming in the FA Cup.
Robins remembers how Gyökeres was not match-ready at first for Coventry and he began by using him more as a substitute. “You could tell it irked him,” Robins told Uefa’s website last November. “I said to everyone around: ‘he’s in a rush.’ You could see he’s in a rush for his career to take off. If he didn’t score after a game, he’d be in a foul mood.”
Gyökeres felt things turn after making his move from Brighton to Coventry permanent in the summer of 2021. There were 17 league goals in his first full season for them; 21 the next, which ended in the penalty shootout defeat against Luton in the Championship playoff final. Then came the explosion at Sporting.
“We would have said at Brighton he was a player who would get into a lot of positions to finish because of his effort and determination,” Hughton says. “We wouldn’t have seen him as somebody that was a natural finisher. What has happened with him is to do with confidence and opportunities – and continually putting himself in positions to have efforts at goal. Whatever we say about Sporting to Arsenal, it is still a big step up. But one thing that is guaranteed is he will get ample opportunities to score.”
Gyökeres has done things the hard way. It feels like a long time ago he was starting out at Aspudden-Tellus, playing on a gravel pitch. His father, Stefan, a former player at Östersund, would be brought in to coach his team, which is normally a little bit strange for the child. And it had to be unsettling for the striker when he was advised to stay away from pre-season training at Sporting to force the transfer to Arsenal.
Gyökeres needed to show his strength of character, as he has done when he was there but no one noticed, no one cared. Everybody sees him now.

Tottenham stunned as Morgan Gibbs-White signs deal to stay at Nottingham Forest,Midfielder pens three-year contract extension,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/26/tottenham-stunned-as-morgan-gibbs-white-signs-deal-to-stay-at-nottingham-forest,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 22:10:17",Mark Dobson,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have been handed a huge blow after their summer transfer target Morgan Gibbs-White signed a new three-year contract at Nottingham Forest.
The 25-year-old was expected to make a £60m move to Spurs earlier this month after they apparently triggered a release clause. However, Forest reacted furiously to the news and threatened legal action over an alleged illegal approach for the player.
Forest had also prepared a complaint to the Premier League, arguing that Spurs’ conduct surrounding the proposed transfer was inappropriate. The two-time European champions consulted lawyers because they believed Spurs did not have permission to speak with Gibbs-White and also felt there had been a breach in confidentiality regarding the release clause in the England man’s contract.
Gibbs-White scored seven goals and added eight assists in 34 league games last season to help Forest finish seventh and qualify for Europe. He had been linked with Spurs and Manchester City. However, late on Saturday night it was announced the midfielder had signed a new deal with Forest which keeps him at the City Ground until 2028.
The Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, said: “Morgan is a special player – not just in terms of talent, but character and mentality. He represents what we want this football club to be: he is a winner, talented, ambitious, fearless and proud.
“There was significant interest from various clubs, but we were determined to build our future with Morgan at the heart of it. I promised our fans we would not only compete, but grow stronger and stronger every season. Today is another big step in that journey.”
Speaking after signing his new deal, Gibbs-White told the club’s official website: “I’ve felt at home at Forest from the moment I arrived. The support from the fans, my teammates and everyone around the club has been unbelievable. I believe in what we’re building here – and with the backing of Mr Marinakis and the enormous ambition he has, I want to be part of making something special. I’m excited for what’s to come.”

Phenoms to flops: 10 stars who swapped Bundesliga for Premier League,"With a fresh influx of talent joining the Premier League from the German top flight this summer, we examine the fortunes of those who made the switch",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/27/football-transfers-bundesliga-premier-league-history,"Sun, 27 Jul 2025 07:00:17",Soccer,"['Chelsea', 'Liverpool']","Liverpool have paid Eintracht Frankfurt an initial £69m to make Hugo Ekitiké their third summer buy from the Bundesliga, after the club record signing Florian Wirtz and right-back Jeremie Frimpong joined from Bayer Leverkusen. Leeds have also brought in three players from Germany’s top flight – Anton Stach, Sebastiaan Bornauw and Lukas Nmecha – and Jamie Gittens, who has moved to Chelsea, is among others who have made that journey in this transfer window. Here we look at 10 notable Premier League signings from the Bundesliga and how they fared.
Michael Ballack: Bayern Munich to Chelsea, May 2006, free
The Germany international played an important and disciplined role at Chelsea in a period when they won one league title and three FA Cups. A proven player in the Bundesliga, where he won trophies with Kaiserslautern and Bayern Munich and went agonisingly close with Bayer Leverkusen, Ballack displayed many of his known qualities in the Premier League and a new defensive skillset that complemented and helped to get the best from Frank Lampard.
Vincent Kompany: Hamburg to Manchester City, Aug 2008, £6m
Kompany arrived at the Etihad a relatively unfamiliar name to English fans. He left 11 years and 12 trophies later anything but. Kompany became City’s captain before the 2011-12 season, when the club famously pipped Manchester United on the final day to win their first Premier League title. The defender played key roles in some of the greatest teams of the Premier League era, including City’s record-breaking centurions season. He left in 2019, widely recognised as the club’s greatest defender.
Roberto Firmino, Hoffenheim to Liverpool, June 2015, £29m
Firmino was signed by Liverpool under Brendan Rogers and many fans didn’t understand how he would fit in. He was not an out-and-out striker and didn’t seem particularly fast or strong. Inside four months Rodgers had gone and Jürgen Klopp had taken over. Klopp would see the potential in “Bobby”, who became massively influential over the next eight years as Liverpool won their first league title in 30 years, the Champions League, Club World Cup, FA Cup and League Cup. Firmino became a fan favourite and his “Sí señor” chant still regularly rings around the Kop. Klopp would describe the Brazilian as “the heart and soul” of his team.
Bastian Schweinsteiger: Bayern Munich to Manchester United, July 2015, £14.4m
Schweinsteiger headed to Old Trafford as one of the most decorated midfielders of the century after securing 20 trophies with Bayern, including eight Bundesliga titles and the Champions League. The German also won the World Cup the year before joining United. Despite this pedigree, his time in Manchester was underwhelming. He made 35 appearances, scoring twice, and – hampered by injuries – failed to show the levels of his time with Bayern. In his second season, he was exiled from the first team by José Mourinho and shipped to Chicago Fire.
Son Heung-min: Bayer Leverkusen to Spurs, Aug 2015, £22m
Son arrived in north London after a career-best season at Leverkusen featuring 21 goals and assists, including three goals in the Champions League. In 10 seasons with Spurs, he is now a club legend, scoring 173 times and providing 101 assists. The forward has been the club’s player of the season three times and became club captain in 2023. Son has established himself as one of the Premier League’s best players, sharing the Golden Boot in the 2021-22 season. He is wanted by Los Angeles this summer.
Kevin De Bruyne: Wolfsburg to Manchester City, Aug 2015, £54m
Arguably the best Premier League signing from the Bundesliga. De Bruyne won two Premier League player-of-the-season awards on his way to five Premier League titles with City. He also won the FA Cup twice, the League Cup five times and the Champions League. Many regard De Bruyne as one of the greatest Premier League midfielders, and City have cemented his legacy by commissioning a statue of the Belgian.
Timo Werner: RB Leipzig to Chelsea, June 2020, £47.5m
In Werner’s final season at Leipzig he looked like one of the game’s top strikers, providing 28 goals and eight assists in 34 Bundesliga appearances. The German could not find the same form in England. He received criticism from Chelsea fans for poor finishing, with 18 big chances missed in his first season, according to StatMuse. His form picked up in the second half of the season, Werner scoring against Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, and he ended it with 12 goals and 15 assists in 52 appearances. The following season the German scored four league goals before being sold back to Leipzig for about half of what Chelsea paid. A return to the Premier League via a loan at Spurs was unsuccessful.
Kai Havertz: Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, Sept 2020, £70m
Huge expectation was placed upon Havertz, who had wowed in Germany, but his first season did not quite meet expectations, with four league goals and one in the Champions League, albeit the winner in the final. Admiration from supporters for that decisive strike would fade after headded only 15 goals in 64 league appearances in the next two seasons. Havertz was sold to Arsenal for £65m and immediately broke the 10-goal mark for the first time in England, netting 13 times, but he still divides opinion among fans. A hamstring injury last February was a setback for Arsenal’s trophy hopes.
Jadon Sancho: Borussia Dortmund to Manchester Utd, July 2021, £73m
Sancho mesmerised at Dortmund, averaging almost 38 goals and assists a season in his final three years there. Abhorrent racist abuse after England’s Euro 2020 final defeat may have affected Sancho, who managed only five goals and three assists in his first campaign with United. His woes continued as he fell out of favour there after scoring seven times in the 2022-23 season. He made only three appearances for United the following season after a falling-out with Erik ten Hag, before being loaned back to Dortmund in January. He has since been on loan at Chelsea, who last month paid United £5m to get out of their obligation to buy him.
Erling Haaland, Dortmund to Manchester City, June 2022, £51.5m
Haaland’s time at Dortmund was exceptional, the Norwegian scoring 86 goals in 89 appearances. City had long been searching for the missing piece to win their first Champions League and Haaland scored 52 goals in his first season to help the club to a historic treble. That included breaking the Premier League record for goals in a single season and he added a second Golden Boot the season after as City won a fourth consecutive league title.

Liverpool to commemorate Diogo Jota with permanent sculpture at Anfield,Physical tributes removed and stored by club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/26/liverpool-diogo-jota-memorial-anfield,"Sat, 26 Jul 2025 19:04:54",Mark Dobson,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool will create a permanent sculpted tribute to Diogo Jota and André Silva while the Premier League champions will wear a “Forever 20” emblem on their shirts in the new campaign. The club confirmed the news before Saturday’s friendly in Hong Kong, where a much-changed side lost 4-2 to Milan.
Jota died in a car crash along with his brother Silva in Spain on 3 July. Tributes were paid at Anfield with flowers, scarves, cards and jerseys being laid around the ground. The club confirmed that physical tributes have been removed and stored, while floral tributes will be composted and used in flower beds at Anfield and training facilities. The remaining items will be recycled and used to create a permanent memorial sculpture at Anfield.
Liverpool’s Premier League season begins with a meeting against Bournemouth on 15 August and a commemoration is set to take place with a fan mosaic and a minute of silence.
Liverpool fans enjoyed their first sighting of their record signing, Florian Wirtz, who made his debut against Milan. The playmaker was lively and his linkup play with Mohamed Salah will have impressed the head coach, Arne Slot, although his team’s vulnerability against some rapid counterattacks was exposed.
Liverpool fell behind in the 10th minute when the outstanding Rafael Leão scored from a Christian Pulisic pass. Dominik Szoboszlai levelled 20 minutes later with a curling shot from the edge of the box following an assist by Rio Ngumoha.
Leão was a key figure with his pace, unsettling Liverpool on the break and he was again the architect of Milan’s second as they retook the lead early in the second half. The Portuguese winger powered past Conor Bradley on the left and set up the former England midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek to fire home.
Noah Okafor added Milan’s third and, while Cody Gakpo nodded in a stoppage-time consolation, Okafor walked in the fourth following a mix-up between stand-in centre-half Kostas Tsimikas and the new Liverpool keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili. Liverpool were forced into playing the Greek international alongside Ibrahima Konaté in the second half as Joe Gomez had returned to Merseyside after an achilles injury.
Luis Díaz was not involved with the winger looking increasingly likely to move to Bayern Munich while Darwin Núñez, another player set to depart Anfield this summer, was said to be nursing a minor injury.
“Conceding four isn’t what we want but you have to consider the circumstances, we missed seven senior players, and wanted to give 20 players playing time, so players have to play out of position,” Slot said. “We still were able to play our normal game, but we were a bit too open in the counterattack.”
Liverpool travel to Japan to take on Yokohama FM in the J League World Challenge on Wednesday with their £79m signing, Hugo Ekitiké, likely to play some part.

The 25-year-old did not travel on the pre-season tour of Asia, with the club stating that he missed out due to a “minor thigh injury”.
Hours later, reports emerged that Isak – who has been linked with a move to Liverpool in recent weeks – had told club executives he wanted to explore the possibility of a transfer away from St James’ Park. Isak has been offered a staggering £600,000-a-week tax-free deal by Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia.
Isak missed Newcastle’s first pre-season fixture against Celtic last weekend and before their friendly against Arsenal on Sunday, Howe provided an update on the striker’s situation. “There’s things going on behind the scenes. He will be aware he’s in the news every day and I’m sure that’s not easy for anyone,” the Newcastle manager said.
“Conversations that happen between Alex and the club or Alex and myself will stay private. We do share a really good relationship with him. He’s been magnificent for us since he’s joined. He’s very popular in the dressing room and we’d love him to continue his journey at Newcastle.”
Howe said there are no contract talks taking place with Isak, who has three years left on his existing deal. “That’ll be for a later date.
“With the situation as it is and the state of the window, in the sense that it’s hurtling towards the end of the window very quickly from our perspective, there’s still so much that could happen.”
Howe confirmed that Isak is in Newcastle being assessed, adding on the club’s website: “With his injury, I’ve got no major update on that. He first mentioned his thigh just before the Celtic game and we assumed it would a be very minimal injury, nothing too serious.
“Then on the Monday after the Celtic game, he went in from training very early, didn’t feel right, so he’s now in Newcastle getting that injury assessed. Hopefully he’ll be back soon playing in the black and white shirt. That’s what we all want to see.”
Isak joined Newcastle in August 2022. The Sweden forward scored 27 goals last season as Newcastle lifted the Carabao Cup and secured Champions League football by finishing fifth in the Premier League.
