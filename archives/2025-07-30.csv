Shaw: There are no stragglers in Man Utd squad anymore,"Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has suggested there are no longer any ""stragglers"" in the squad as a result of Ruben Amorim's tough approach.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13403854/manchestester-united-luke-shaw-says-there-are-no-longer-any-stragglers-in-the-squad-due-to-ruben-amorim-approach,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 07:47:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has suggested there are no longer any ""stragglers"" in the squad as a result of Ruben Amorim's tough approach.
United are currently taking part in a tour of the USA, where they are competing in the Premier League Summer Series, as Amorim's side prepare for the new campaign.
United begin the new season with a clash against Arsenal at Old Trafford in what will represent the beginning of Amorim's first full season in charge of the club.
The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.
Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without any European football in 35 years.
Despite the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao, Shaw was quick to defend manager Amorim after the game, explaining that the Portuguese is the right man to lead the club forward. Asked to further explain his comments during United's training camp in Chicago, Shaw doubled down on his stance.
""I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],"" Shaw said.
""He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.
""I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.
""Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.""
While there were some lows for Shaw both personally and United as a team, Shaw believes the spirit in pre-season should spur them on to lofty ambitions like winning the Premier League.
""I can't be any worse than it was last season,"" Shaw said.
""I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.
""Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.
""I'm enjoying that. Aims wise, I think the aim has to be winning the Premier League.
""I know people will be questioning me for saying that after last season, but it has to be that. It's not just me who thinks that. I'm sure the whole team, if you ask them, they all have the same aims.
""Even the manager, I'm sure he probably wouldn't say it in the press, but we all have to have the same beliefs and ambitions. Like I said, that real family feeling together, and we all strive for the same thing.""
Since Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford, he has overseen a period of changes to the squad with some understood to be allowed to leave this summer.
Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof left the club upon the expiry of their contracts at the end of June, while Jonny Evans announced his retirement, taking up a role in United's academy.
Sky Sports News have been reporting that Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are not taking part in United's tour of the US as they have been given extra time by Man Utd to explore moves away from the club.
Marcus Rashford, who was also training away from the main squad after returning from a six-month loan spell at Aston Villa this summer, has secured a loan move to Barcelona, which includes an option to buy for the LaLiga side.
After Rashford's departure, United continue to work on exits for Sancho, Antony and Malacia - as well as Garnacho.

Man City re-sign Trafford from Burnley,James Trafford has joined Manchester City from Burnley in a deal the newly-promoted Premier League side say is a record fee for a British goalkeeper.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13402939/james-trafford-transfer-news-man-city-complete-deal-to-re-sign-goalkeeper-from-burnley,"Tue, 29 Jul 2025 21:52:00",,['Manchester City'],"James Trafford has joined Manchester City from Burnley in a deal the newly-promoted Premier League side say is a record fee for a British goalkeeper.
City will pay £27m, but the deal is worth £31m.
City had a matching clause inserted when they sold Trafford to Burnley in 2023.
Newcastle agreed a £31m fee with Burnley last week, which City matched.
However, City also had a sell-on clause inserted - meaning their outlay totals £27m.
The previous record for a British keeper was worth £30m when Everton signed Jordan Pickford from Sunderland.
Trafford has signed a five-year deal with the option of an extra year and will compete with Ederson for the No 1 shirt under Pep Guardiola.
Stefan Ortega, who started 13 games in the Premier League last season, is expected to leave the club, but an exit is not close to being agreed.
Sky Sports News understands Burnley hold an interest in the player.
Trafford's return to Man City fulfils a dream he had of going back to his former club.
The England U21 goalkeeper said: ""Rejoining City is such a special and proud moment both for me and my family. I always dreamed that one day I would be able to come back to Manchester City.
""This is the place I call home - it's a truly special football club with fantastic people who make it such a unique place to work and play.
""I am also very excited and honoured to have been given the opportunity to work under Pep and with such a world-class group of players.
""I am still very young and hungry to keep learning and improving - and I know there is no better environment than Manchester City to help make me become the best goalkeeper I can be.
""I also cannot wait to play in front of the amazing City fans for the first time and will do everything I can to help this great club look to achieve even more success.""
Trafford joined City's academy in 2015, but after loans at Accrington and Bolton, the need for regular first-team football - with Ederson still the man to displace at the Etihad Stadium - took him to Turf Moor.
""When I had the opportunity to go to Burnley I thought it was the right step for me in that moment and in the long-term it was to achieve to come back here. I'm happy that I've achieved it,"" he added.
Trafford, who will wear the number one shirt, becomes the club's sixth signing of the summer after Rayan Ait-Nouri, Tijjani Reijnders, Marcus Bettinelli, Rayan Cherki and Sverre Nypan.
City's sporting director Hugo Viana said: ""James is already one of the most accomplished young goalkeepers in the English game, and we are delighted to welcome him back to Manchester City.
""We feel he is an ideal fit for this squad and will bring great quality to the goalkeeping department.
""We fully believe he will be really successful and a top goalkeeper for Manchester City and the national team.
""I also have no doubt that working with Pep and the technical staff here at City will only see James further develop his abilities.""

Bayern Munich sign Liverpool winger Diaz for £65m,German champions Bayern Munich complete the £65.5m signing of Liverpool and Colombia winger Luis Diaz.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1w8j9g5qleo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:01:13",Sean Kearns,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool winger Luis Diaz has completed a £65.5m move to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.
The Colombia international has signed a four-year deal with the German club to bring his three-and-a-half-year stay at Anfield to an end.

Shaw backs Amorim's hard-line 'demands',"Manchester United defender Luke Shaw backs head coach Ruben Amorim's hard-line approach to improving the ""toxic"" and ""unhealthy"" culture at the club.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0j98qpwwx0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:00:26",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has backed head coach Ruben Amorim's hard-line approach to improving the ""toxic"" and ""unhealthy"" culture at the club.
In May, after United's Europa League final defeat by Tottenham, Shaw questioned whether he and his team-mates were good enough to play for the club, comments that drew criticism, external from former captain Gary Neville.
Looking back, Shaw said his damning assessment was triggered by a mixture of the hurt he was feeling at a time when his head was still ""hot"" as he tried to come to terms with the shattering defeat, which cost United any chance of European qualification after their woeful 15th-placed Premier League finish.
Amorim responded to the loss by resolving to drive up standards inside the dressing room while also excluding five senior players, including Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.
""It's not hard to see from the outside what it's been like,"" said Shaw.
""A lot of the time I've been here over the last few years it's been extremely negative.
""It can be quite toxic, the environment, it's not healthy at all. We need an environment that's healthy, that's positive, that's got good energy and happiness. When you have all those things, you feel free and you express yourself more.
""Ruben brings demands. Mentality is a big thing. He talks a lot about it.
""He demands 100% and doesn't want anything less. If someone's doing 85-90%, it's not enough. I think, especially this year, if you're not doing the right things, you won't play.""
Shaw, 30, says the message must be reinforced by United's senior players, including himself.
""The more experienced ones need to be demanding more, day in, day out,"" he said.
""The levels in training, keeping to the times of when we're doing this or that, making sure no-one's coming late.
""The manager's not bothered. He doesn't care who the player is. That's how it should be. Whatever he wants, as players, we have to be delivering – and we are fully behind that.""
Shaw did not mention United's 'bomb squad' - Rashford, Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Antony - in his assessment and was not placing all the blame on those players, four of whom were not even at United for the second half of last season.
In a separate chat at a Premier League event in Chicago, the England defender did say there are ""no stragglers in this group any more"" and that Amorim had made it clear ""everyone needs to put the team first"".
However, United's longest serving player feels the aftermath of the final defeat in Bilbao took the club to such a bad place, it left everyone in Amorim's squad uncertain for what the future held.
""I wouldn't say I regret what I said but straight after the game, your head is hot, you say things and don't think about it,"" he said.
""A lot of people, after that final, and after that year, didn't know how the next season was going to look, we have to be open and honest about that. None of us were good enough.
""I had such an awful year as well. I was just fully angry about everything. That's why I did the interview and said what I said.""

Trafford rejoins Man City for 'British record fee',Manchester City buy back their former academy goalkeeper James Trafford from Burnley for what the Clarets say is a record fee for a British goalkeeper.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgk3k0654x6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:30:03",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Goalkeeper James Trafford has rejoined Manchester City from Burnley in a deal which the Clarets say is a new record fee for a British goalkeeper.
City sources say the move is worth £27m plus add-ons.
However, Burnley sources put the figure at £31m plus add-ons and a sell-on clause.
That would take the deal above the previous record of £30m which Everton paid Sunderland for Jordan Pickford in 2017.
City academy graduate Trafford, 22, signed for the Clarets for up to £19m in July 2023.
He impressed last season as Scott Parker's side won promotion back to the Premier League - keeping 29 clean sheets across 45 Championship games - and was named in the division's team of the year.
Announcing his departure, Burnley said ""the move to City is a record transfer fee for a British goalkeeper and a club record sale"".
City had a buy-back clause for Trafford and also matching rights, allowing them to equal any offer from another club.
They moved for the player following a £27m bid from Newcastle - and Trafford  opted for a return to Manchester.
He has signed a five-year contract with the option for another year at Etihad Stadium, and will wear the number one shirt.
""Rejoining City is such a special and proud moment both for me and my family,"" Trafford said, adding that he was returning to the club ""a hundred times better"" than the player who left in 2023.
""I always dreamed that one day I would be able to come back to Manchester City.
""This is the place I call home - it's a truly special football club.
""I am still very young and hungry to keep learning and improving - and I know there is no better environment than Manchester City to help make me become the best goalkeeper I can be.""
Director of football Hugo Viana added: ""James is already one of the most accomplished young goalkeepers in the English game, and we are delighted to welcome him back to Manchester City.
""He has all the attributes a top-class goalkeeper requires.
""We fully believe he will be really successful and a top goalkeeper for Manchester City and the [England] national team.""
Trafford is the fourth goalkeeper at manager Pep Guardiola's disposal, with Ederson, Stefan Ortega and Marcus Bettinelli already at the club.
Trafford will challenge Brazil's Ederson, who has been first choice for eight years, for the number one spot.
Ederson is in the final year of his contract and has been linked with a move to Galatasaray, but last month described rumours of a departure as ""99% fake news"".
City have not received any bids for the 31-year-old, but there are doubts about the future of German Ortega given the increased competition for game time Trafford's arrival will bring.
Trafford signed for City's academy in 2015 but did not make a first-team appearance and spent time on loan at Accrington Stanley and Bolton Wanderers.
He made 73 appearances for Burnley, including 28 in the Premier League in the 2023-24 season.
Trafford has represented England from under-17 to under-21 level, and was part of the winning European Championship squad of 2023, during which he did not concede a goal.
He received his first senior international call-up in 2024 but has yet to make his debut at that level.
Trafford is City's sixth signing of the window after midfielders Tijjani Reijnders (initial fee of £46.5m), Rayan Cherki (initial fee of £30.5m) and Sverre Nypan (£12.5m); left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri (£31m) and Bettinelli (nominal fee).
They also spent £200m in the January transfer window to boost their squad following significant injuries.
'City can develop him into a top goalkeeper' - analysis
Manchester City insert buy-back clauses when they sell players, yet tend not to activate them when those academy products move on.
But this is an example of why they put them in the deals, as it has proven helpful in the ability to buy back a talented player on this occasion.
Having served an impressive apprenticeship at Turf Moor, City believe they can develop him into a top goalkeeper - one who is already ready for the Premier League.
However, the club now have the dilemma of moving on either Ederson, who is entering the final year of his contract, or Ortega, who has now slipped a place down the pecking order.
How does Trafford compare to City's goalkeepers?
Trafford conceded just 16 league goals with Burnley last term and kept a Championship-best 29 clean sheets, equalling Port Vale's Football League record which was set 71 years ago.
He also set a new Championship record of 12 consecutive shutouts between December and February before he was finally beaten in a 2-1 victory at Cardiff City at the start of March.
But despite his stellar performances in the second tier last season, Trafford lacks a degree of top-flight experience and only 28 of his 153 senior appearances have been in the Premier League.
Trafford's shot-stopping is undoubtedly first rate and his save percentage stands at almost 85% last season.
That figure far exceeds the numbers posted by both Ederson and Stefan Ortega, although Trafford was largely facing inferior opposition at Championship level.
But he will have to develop his distribution if he is to fit into Guardiola's side and system as his pass completion of 70% is comfortably lower than that of Manchester City's current goalkeepers.
That is partly because Burnley opted to go long more often - averaging 55 long passes per game compared to City's 36 - and partly because Ederson and Ortega are more proficient at playing out from the back.

How would Liverpool fit Ekitike and Isak in the same team?,BBC Sport takes a look at how Liverpool could fit both Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak in the same team.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cqlerrl7dr3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:48:46",Alex Keble,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool's summer window was already the most curious we've ever seen from a Premier League champion.
Signing Bundesliga stars en masse and swapping out both full-backs implies a major tactical shift that will emphatically end the Jurgen Klopp era and herald the dawn of a new one.
But bringing in Newcastle's Alexander Isak would push Liverpool's transfer business into unprecedented territory, having already also signed Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt.
Not since the age of good old-fashioned 4-4-2s - when little-and-large strike partnerships were borderline mandatory - have we seen a top club sign two elite number nines in the same window.
What exactly is Arne Slot thinking?
Here are five ways it might work…
An ultra-narrow 4-2-3-1 with Wirtz, Ekitike and Salah behind Isak
All of our theories here are going to require some square pegs in round holes - except this one.
Liverpool could deploy a squeezed 4-2-3-1, in which the nominal wingers Salah and Ekitike are so narrow they operate more as number 10s either side of Florian Wirtz, with the width then provided by two flying full-backs.
Jeremie Frimpong is a very attacking right-back, whose presence is likely to push Salah more infield anyway, while Ekitike tends to drop into 10-ish positions even when starting as a nine, as we see in the graphic below.
This system would allow for fluid movement among that trio of number 10s. For example, when one of Salah and Ekitike drifts wide the other would remain narrow alongside Wirtz, creating the box-shape (with Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch) that is so important in modern Premier League tactics.
At other moments, Ekitike or Salah may drive ahead into more of a centre-forward role next to Isak, in turn shuffling the box up a line, connecting with two number 10s behind them.
This is arguably the most dynamic formation Slot could use to get all four players into his starting XI - but it would be quite a departure from what went before.
So let's look at a more conservative idea...
Ekitike replacing Diaz as left-winger in Slot's conventional 4-2-3-1
The simpler thing to do is fully convert Ekitike into a Luis Diaz replacement, assuming the Colombia forward completes his move to Bayern Munich.
Ekitike has played just nine games (two starts and 324 minutes total) as a left-winger, although he has often tended to drift out to that side, most notably throughout 2023-24.
More importantly, the way Slot has used Cody Gapko and Diaz - as one-on-one dribblers, using their acceleration to cut inside full-backs - corresponds with Ekitike's best qualities.
In the Bundesliga last season Ekitike came fifth for attempted dribbles (126) and for shot-ending carries (44). He also provided eight assists and ranked fifth (again) for 'attacking sequence' involvements.
He hasn't done it much before, but Ekitike has the makings of a Slot left-winger.
Ekitike and Isak together, Frankfurt-style, in a 4-2-2-2
Ekitike's best football at Frankfurt came as part of a proper strike partnership with Omar Marmoush before his January departure to Manchester City saw the end of Dino Toppmoller's 3-5-2 formation.
Marmoush and Ekitike regularly swapped positions, dove-tailing instinctively as one dropped and the other went in behind. It was a swirling, rhythmic balance that confounded defenders and propelled Frankfurt into a title challenge until late December.
Liverpool are unlikely to move to a back three any time soon, not least because a 3-5-2 with Ekitike and Isak would mean benching Salah. But there is a way to put Isak and Ekitike together, albeit a pretty risky one.
Slot's Liverpool regularly line up in a 4-2-4/4-4-2 when not in possession, but crucially that's with a 10 (Dominik Szoboszlai) playing very much as a third midfielder when Liverpool have the ball.
What we're suggesting here is notably more fragile through the middle, requiring a two-man midfield to cover all the space when a quick turnover triggers an opposition counter-attack.
There's also the problem of playing Wirtz on the left, a position he has only very occasionally played for Bayer Leverkusen and Germany.
In all likelihood, this is one for when Liverpool are chasing a game. It's a bit kitchen-sinky for anything earlier than that.
Ekitike and Wirtz as dual eights in the De Bruyne and Silva mould
If number three sounded a bit weird, then you won't like this idea. But it really could work.
Wirtz is regularly compared favourably with Kevin de Bruyne, while Marmoush (Ekitike's old strike partner and a player with similar characteristics to the new Liverpool forward) has been plonked into the De Bruyne role at Man City.
It's plausible Ekitike could adapt into that hybrid eight/10 position, playing alongside Wirtz much in the way Pep Guardiola has historically used two aggressive eights in front of a number six.
Guardiola has always been a big influence on Slot, who once described the Catalan's playing style as ""the ultimate joy in football"". Maybe, just maybe, the Liverpool manager plans to take the Pep influence to a whole new level and regularly start with two eights/10s.
But Premier League football is increasingly transitional and end-to-end, with slower possession-hogging on its way out, which is why Guardiola is far more likely to play with two sixes - in a 4-2-3-1 - than the dual playmaker system we saw in his early title wins.
When elite teams start to see less of the ball, and when the opposition isn't so pinned back, it becomes more important to have a solid midfield base that can block those quick-fire counters.
Most of the time, Ryan Gravenberch won't be able to do it all on his own. But a City-esque 4-3-3 would be exciting to see.
Ekitike as competition for four separate forward positions
We don't necessarily need to come up with a wildcard formation that crams all the new signings into the same team.
If all goes well Liverpool will play over 60 games next season, meaning they will need a regularly rotating front line to keep legs fresh and opponents guessing.
Ekitike as a £69m cover option probably doesn't sound very appealing, but he will arguably be the second-best player in four separate positions for Liverpool - although Szoboszlai, rivalling Wirtz, might say otherwise.
When you consider injuries, the need to rotate for twice-weekly football, and Slot's tactical adaptations to the opposition, Ekitike could easily tot up over 30 starts in all competitions even if he wasn't technically considered to be in the club's best XI.
Not that managers of elite clubs tend to think in terms of 'best XIs' anymore - schedules are too busy and injuries too common for that.
In fact, what fans assume to be their team's best XI rarely actually play together, as many Liverpool supporters know all too well.
The most mind-blowing example of this phenomenon was first highlighted by Duncan Alexander,, external who pointed out that the supposedly-iconic Liverpool XI under Klopp - the one that started the Champions League final - had never played together before that game and never played together after it.
So, how do you solve the riddle? How do you get all of Liverpool's new signings into the same team? Answer: you don't.

Chess fan Mbeumo on why Man Utd was right move for him,"Manchester United summer signing Bryan Mbeumo discusses his passion for chess and piano, and explains his draw to head coach Ruben Amorim's 'vision'",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg4vneg5j4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 29 Jul 2025 16:16:50",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Bryan Mbeumo has no problem playing football in front of thousands of people - it's when you sit him in front of a piano with a couple of mates that the nerves kick in.
""It's funny, but it's so different,"" Manchester United's £65m new signing explains.
""Even if I play in front of a couple of friends at home, I'm not exactly shaking but it's 'oh guys, this is kind of hard for me'.""
Sitting in front of Mbeumo at United's team hotel in Chicago midway through their pre-season trip is to be presented with a different type of Premier League star.
Mbeumo is quiet, relaxed and respectful, completely at odds with the explosive manner in which he plays.
He scored 20 Premier League goals last season, which made him a primary target for United head coach Ruben Amorim as he tries to make his formation work.
The Cameroon international says he was sold on the United ""project"" - there were conversations with other clubs but he wanted to move to Old Trafford and, even as the drawn-out discussions continued, he never really felt the deal would collapse because he trusted the people around him to deliver the move he wanted.
It was the kind of standard question and answer session you expect from a new arrival.
But when you get the former Brentford man talking about the piano and his other great passion, chess, that is when his eyes light up.
Unlike Lionesses Euros hero Michelle Agyemang, who took her piano to Switzerland and played in her room every day, Mbeumo has no great desire to widen his audience.
""I'm self-taught,"" he said. ""And I'm not bad.
""The piano is nothing really linked to football. It just makes me take time for me and relax myself in my free time.""
It sounds like the perfect initiation performance in front of his new team-mates but Mbeumo is dubious.
""We will see,"" he ponders. ""The thing is, I don't really like to play in front of people.""
Chess? It's just like football
Mbeumo says he has heard Dutch forward Joshua Zirkzee likes to play chess so he may take his board on United duty and challenge his team-mate to a game, but for now, most of his chess playing is done anonymously online.
Introducing himself as Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United footballer, to his opponents probably wouldn't deliver the outcome he is looking for.
""I have a user name,"" he said. ""You choose a nickname and just play against random people online. I use my own chess board against them.
""I'm not that crazy good. But if you know the rating, I'm like 800 on Chess.com.""
On the surface, it is hard to think of something more different to football, given the intensity of thought and strategy behind each move.
Mbeumo counters that. The similarities, he says, are more striking than you might think.
Others clearly think so too.
Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze won £15,000 in a four-day amateur PogChamps tournament, contested by 12 content creators and athletes.
The money is a side issue for players with the earning power of Eze and Mbeumo. The attraction comes from the challenge.
""Even if it's not physical, there is a lot of thought in chess,"" said Mbeumo.
""When you play football you have to think as well. Playing chess you can see some moves ahead because it is a strategy game. In football you have your strategy as well so you can link them together.
""There was one period where I was really into it.
""I was watching videos on YouTube and doing training on the app.
""It's really good for the brain and you can develop new skills.
""Obviously, you're doing football most of the time, every day, so you sometimes you don't really have time to develop on other skills. But I really like the creativity.""
Mbeumo's interest in chess expanded to watching the Golden Globe-winning mini series The Queen's Gambit. But he has yet to see the Netflix documentary on multiple world champion and world number one Magnus Carlsen.
For now, Mbeumo is concentrating on getting fit.
Convinced by United 'vision'
His former team Brentford were not scheduled to report back for training until a week after United's players, and so the 25-year-old stayed mainly in the gym rather than get involved in his new club's team sessions.
It explains why he is behind the rest of Ruben Amorim's squad in fitness terms and was not involved in Saturday's victory over West Ham at the MetLife Stadium.
Amorim has already said Mbeumo will also sit out Wednesday's encounter with Bournemouth in Chicago.
However, the forward may be involved in the final match of the Premier League Summer Series against Everton in Atlanta on 3 August.
Mbeumo is unfazed by having to wait to make his United debut.
""My first aim is to make sure I'm ready for the start of the season, so I'll keep working hard,"" he said.
That opening-weekend encounter with Arsenal at Old Trafford is followed by a trip to Fulham.
While United do have a good record at Craven Cottage, it is the type of test that has repeatedly proved beyond them over the past few years.
And Mbeumo's old side Brentford have proved particularly difficult opponents, winning two and drawing one of their last three meetings at the Gtech Community Stadium.
Mbeumo scored in the first of those games, setting the seal on a 4-0 victory in August 2022 that proved the trigger for United's transfer window panic and resulted in them spending £155m to bring Casemiro and Antony to the club before that summer's transfer window closed..
It is that profligacy United are trying to correct now, led by chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox.
Mbeumo and fellow big-name arrival Matheus Cunha at least fit into Amorim's famed 3-5-2-1 system as the two number 10s.
He was convinced, as was Cunha, by a vision which goes beyond the current campaign, which features no European football at all, let alone the Champions League, which was on offer from his other suitors, which included Newcastle and Tottenham, now managed by his former boss at Brentford Thomas Frank.
""Of course, I spoke to some others because I wanted to hear their projects but the Manchester United one was very good for me,"" he said.
""Ruben [Amorim] says 'we are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team', which is what we will try to do.
""I'm someone who likes a challenge. Manchester [United] are a big club. I think it's a great opportunity and I wanted to be part of it. That's why I chose the project.""

Football transfer rumours: Manchester United move for £60m-rated Watkins?,Today’s rumours are a throwback,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/30/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-united-ollie-watkins,"Wed, 30 Jul 2025 08:07:37",Barry Glendenning,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea', 'Manchester United', 'Liverpool', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Given his current employers’ well-documented interest in securing the services of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace, Leandro Trossard is understandably reluctant to sign a contract extension with Arsenal until he has a better idea of how likely he is to get game time at the Emirates Stadium next season. The Belgian winger is the subject of interest from Borussia Dortmund, while at least two unnamed Premier League clubs are reported to have made “concrete offers”. Exactly how much concrete we’re talking about is unknown, but it seems Arsenal wouldn’t be adverse to cashing in on a player they bought from Brighton for £27m two years ago. Following a summer influx that isn’t necessarily over, the club are also believed to be open to offers for some or all of Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus, Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko.
The mass exodus of Bournemouth defenders shows no sign of abating, with Paris Saint-Germain apparently determined to lure Illia Zabarnyi to the French capital. A fan favourite who is regularly serenaded with a cleverly reworked chorus of Whitney Houston’s dancefloor filler I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me), the 22-year-old Ukrainian could join Milos Kerkez (Liverpool), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid) and Kepa Arrizabalaga (Arsenal via parent club Chelsea) in heading for the exit and is reported to have been the subject of an initial £50m bid from the Champions League winners, which Bournemouth have rejected. Tottenham Hotspur have also been linked with a move for the centre-back.
While Aaron Ramsdale may not be among the more glamorous targets to have been approached by Newcastle this summer, the Southampton goalkeeper does look to be on the verge of signing for Eddie Howe’s side, in a state of affairs that may prompt Manchester United to bid for his fellow England understudy Nick Pope. In the final year of his contract on Tyneside, the prospect of losing Pope is unlikely to get Newcastle fans as exercised as that of a certain in-demand and possibly Liverpool-bound Swedish striker, but the word from St James’ Park appears to be that Howe is bringing Ramsdale in to compete with, rather than replace his current first-choice keeper.
Ollie Watkins is reported to be open to a move to Old Trafford but Aston Villa’s £60m valuation for the England striker is apparently too rich for Jim Ratcliffe’s blood. The Manchester United beancounters are hoping they can barter Villa down to a more palatable fee with their outcast winger Alejandro Garnacho thrown in to help grease the wheels of commercial progress. In other Villa news, Àlex Moreno could become a gentleman of Girona if the Spanish side’s manager Michel is successful in his bid to be reunited with a player he previously coached at Rayo Vallecano. Having spent last season on an underwhelming loan spell at Nottingham Forest, the 32-year-old is surplus to requirements at Villa Park and eager to leave.
After his summer departure from Bayern Munich, Thomas Müller is MLS-bound and, despite interest from FC Cincinnati, looks likely to sign for Vancouver Whitecaps in a deal dependent on such romantic niceties as “targeted allocation money” and the successful negotiation of “discovery rights”. Set to become the Whitecaps’ most high-profile acquisition since one-time Brechin City Boys Club graduate Ryan Gauld, the German international will join a club that sits one point off top spot in the Western Conference with a game in hand over leaders San Diego.

James Trafford completes return ‘home’ to Manchester City in £27m deal,Goalkeeper is handed five-year contract,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/29/james-trafford-completes-manchester-city-return-burnley-27m-deal,"Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:04:25",Will Unwin,['Manchester City'],"James Trafford has returned “home” to Manchester City from Burnley in a £27m deal after two seasons at Turf Moor. The goalkeeper has signed a five-year deal, with the option of a sixth, at the Etihad Stadium where he will battle with Ederson and Stefan Ortega to be first choice.
It was anticipated that Trafford would move to Newcastle, who have been tracking him over the past 12 months. City, however, used their matching rights clause, inserted when the goalkeeper left the club in 2023, to secure his services. The fee has been confirmed as a club-record sale by the Clarets.
“Rejoining City is such a special and proud moment both for me and my family,” Trafford said. “I always dreamed that one day I would be able to come back to Manchester City. This is the place I call home – it’s a truly special football club with fantastic people who make it such a unique place to work and play.
“I am also very excited and honoured to have been given the opportunity to work under Pep [Guardiola] and with such a world-class group of players. I am still very young and hungry to keep learning and improving – and I know there is no better environment than Manchester City to help make me become the best goalkeeper I can be.”
The 22-year-old Cumbrian joined City aged 12 from Carlisle and went on to have eight years in ­Manchester before joining Burnley in 2023 for £14m. Prior to moving to Turf Moor, Trafford impressed during loan spells at Accrington and Bolton but never made a first-team appearance for City, although he did work with the first-team goalkeepers.
“When he [Ederson] first joined, he was extremely talented,” Trafford said. “He is one of a kind with the ball at his feet. He was someone that I looked up to a lot when I first trained with him when I was 17. I tried to take small bits of his game and try to put them into my game and improve.”
Vincent Kompany made Trafford his first choice at Burnley, giving him a first taste of Premier League football. But in a struggling side he was dropped eventually in favour of ­Arijanet Muric as Burnley went down. Trafford recovered his form and confidence last season, helping the Clarets to reach the top flight, conceding 16 goals in 45 appearances, with 29 clean sheets.
Trafford was an integral member of the England Under-21 squad that won the European Championship in 2023, saving a penalty in the final, and has been named in numerous senior squads but is yet to make his full international debut.
Guardiola has four senior goalkeepers at his disposal, having also signed Marcus Bettinelli this summer. Ederson has been the subject of interest from Galatasaray and numerous enquires have been made in relation to Ortega but nothing concrete has emerged.

Chelsea close to £35m deal for Ajax’s Jorrel Hato and want RB Leipzig’s Xavi Simons,"Hato, 19, can play at left-back or centre-back",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/29/chelsea-35m-deal-for-ajax-jorrel-hato-rb-leipzig-xavi-simons-transfer,"Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:13:23",Ed Aarons,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea are closing in on the signing of Jorrel Hato from Ajax and have opened talks with RB Leipzig over a move for the defender’s Netherlands teammate Xavi Simons.
It is understood that personal terms have been agreed with Hato, who has made more than 100 appearances for Ajax’s first team despite turning 19 only in March.
Negotiations with the Dutch club over a fee of around €40m (£35m) are believed to be in the final stages, with Enzo Maresca hoping to add to his options at left-back and in central defence.
Hato, who in 2023 became the youngest player to captain Ajax aged 17 and made his senior international debut a few weeks later, is capable of filling both roles and is regarded as one of Europe’s brightest prospects. He was part of the Netherlands Under-21 side that was defeated in the semi-finals of the European Championship in Slovakia last month and has won six senior caps.
Chelsea, who have signed Liam Delap, João Pedro and Jamie Gittens this summer, are also understood to be confident of agreeing a deal for Simons. The 22-year-old forward, who is capable of playing in several attacking roles, joined Leipzig from Paris Saint-Germain in January for €50m after two successful loan spells and it is expected that he could cost up to €70m.
Simons has also attracted interest from Bayern Munich but is thought to prefer a move to the Premier League.
Chelsea have already sanctioned the departures of Kepa Arrizabalaga, Noni Madueke and Djordje Petrovic, while João Félix joined the Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr on Tuesday after a £44m deal was agreed.

Football transfer rumours: Donnarumma to leave PSG … for Manchester United?,Today’s rumours are upside down,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/29/football-transfer-rumour-mill-gianluigi-donnarumma-psg-manchester-united,"Tue, 29 Jul 2025 08:39:00",Michael Butler,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","Gianluigi Donnarumma would be most people’s pick as the best goalkeeper in the world, playing for the best team in the world (not now, Chelsea fans), the Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain. So while the French club’s decision to sign a new goalkeeper – and a very good goalkeeper in Lucas Chevalier from Lille – is an eyebrow-raising one, it simply felt like an expensive exercise in keeping Donnarumma on his toes. Imagine the Mill’s surprise that Donnarumma is now being linked with an exit from PSG … to Manchester United! Just why an elite keeper would want to join a team that finished 15th in the Premier League, is not playing in Europe and has no serious ambition for a league title is beyond comprehension, particularly as the usual answer is money. Donnarumma already earns €12m per year after tax, and United have spent the last couple of years pleading poverty. But L’Équipe seem fairly convinced of the rumours and we are just here to translate.
Borussia Dortmund are light on wingers after Jamie Gittens left for Chelsea and Jadon Sancho has again been mooted as a potential replacement. The Englishman has twice signed for the German club – most recently on loan in January last year – and the 25-year-old could complete a permanent switch with Manchester United asking for just £20m. Any deal would be dependent on Sancho taking a substantial pay cut.
Idrissa Gueye, Metz’s 18-year-old forward rather than the veteran Everton midfielder, is a more left-field option for Dortmund, although Premier League quartet Manchester United, Burnley, Brentford and Southampton are also in the mix for the teenager.
Anthony Elanga is one of the quickest players in the league, and having lost the Sweden international to Newcastle, Nottingham Forest are in the market for a pacy replacement: Adama Traoré fits the bill. Just how much the Fulham winger will cost is anyone’s guess, given he has flickered between a bench warmer to gamechanger in the last few seasons. Traoré is 29 and has one year remaining on his contract, so Fulham could be tempted into a sale, while the Spaniard might be keen on reuniting with Nuno Espírito Santo, his former manager at Wolves.
Should Fulham lose the muscly Spaniard, Reiss Nelson – now of Lyon – could be an option for the Cottagers. A loan move with an option to buy has reportedly been lined up. Another former Arsenal winger, Raheem Sterling, who is collecting dust and £325,000 per week at Chelsea, has also been linked to Fulham.
Nick Woltemade was one of the stars of the Under-21 European Championships and his club Stuttgart have reportedly rejected two bids from Bayern Munich for the German striker, the latter said to be worth around €50m. The Stuttgart sporting director Fabian Wohlgemuth told Sky: “There is no new position. Nick will very likely be part of our squad this season as well. We have communicated this clearly and unequivocally to the public. An early transfer for Nick under the current circumstances is simply not relevant.”
