Zubimendi ready for 'new things' after year-long wait to join Arsenal,"Martin Zubimendi says he is ready to do ""new things"" with Arsenal after joining the club earlier this summer.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd6gd6801jpo,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 07:01:38",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal fans will get to see their new midfielder Martin Zubimendi in action for the first time on Wednesday - 12 months after the Gunners first set in motion a deal to bring him to the club.
The 26-year-old, one of the most highly-rated number sixes in Europe, played his first minutes for Arsenal in a behind closed door friendly against Watford last Saturday.
But his first appearance in front of supporters since making a £60m move from Real Sociedad earlier this month is expected to come against AC Milan in Singapore.
Zubimendi is a name that many football fans will be familiar with, having played a key role in Spain beating England in the Euro 2024 final. Last summer he also turned down a move to Liverpool.
What was not known at that time, however, is that Arsenal were already making moves to secure Zubimendi this summer after completing a deal for Mikel Merino.
""I think it was a really well-orchestrated plan by the club, and everybody that was involved in it, to understand how we could get what we wanted in two different years, and both at the same time,"" said manager Mikel Arteta.
""And both players were very keen to come, which is very necessary. I think we had a club in Real Sociedad that understood the situation, and they've been excellent.
""We did what we wanted and the players did what we wanted. I think Real Sociedad at the end were happy with the outcome, so I think it's a very positive outcome for all parties.""
Arteta was asked if Zubimendi was going to play more as a six or a number eight and, without hesitation, the Arsenal manager made clear why he has brought Zubimendi to the club.
""Six. Really excited,"" he said. ""And again as I said before when you have him every single day, just around the building, just in training sessions, how he captures the information, how he processes things on the pitch, it's very impressive.
""I'm very, very happy to have him.""
'It wasn't an easy time'
Zubimendi says it ""wasn't an easy time"" for him last summer, trying to decide what was best for his future during a spell of intense transfer speculation.
""The first question I had to answer was whether I wanted to leave Real, and it wasn't the right time,"" he explained.
""I felt that Real offered me more opportunities and that I still had a lot to learn, so staying at Real was the best decision for me.""
Zubimendi and Arteta hit it off after speaking on the phone and the Spain international says that the Arsenal manager's ""obsession"" with ""details"" is one of the reasons why he wanted to join the club.
""I don't know what he saw in me, but I saw him as one of the top coaches in Europe. he explained.
""At the end of the day, I wanted a quality coach when I left Real Sociedad.
""I think I've found him. In the few days I've been here, I've seen how meticulous he is about every aspect of the game, so I think he's the one.""
Zubimendi also says he is learning ""a lot"" from his new boss.
""I think I'm going to try to do things I didn't do before,"" he said. ""Playing in that position, I'll try to bring balance and provide that passing outlet that I'm known for.
""Beyond that, I'm sure he'll ask me to do new things.""

'We didn't touch that subject'
Zubimendi was talking to reporters alongside team-mate Merino as part of Arsenal's away kit launch at the Nova Rooftop in Singapore.
Despite following Merino to Emirates Stadium, the pair ""didn't speak much"" about the prospect of being reunited during their year apart.
""I think we were fighting for big things,"" said Merino, who also plays alongside Zubimendi with Spain. ""For me it was a really tough season last year and he was really focused in Sociedad.
""Even with the national team we didn't touch that subject.
""I guess I was only focused on my thing. I was asking him how he was doing at Sociedad, but we didn't talk about our future.""
The signing of Zubimendi alongside Christian Norgaard from Brentford means that Merino will have a bigger battle to get into the starting XI, with Declan Rice and captain Martin Odegaard also playing in the same area of the pitch.
""It's unbelievable the amount of quality and talent that we have, not only in the midfield but in the whole squad,"" said Merino. ""I think this is a great, great thing to have.
""It's not only pushing each other in every training session and every game to get better, but as well, we saw last year, and we have examples now, how important it is to have a long squad with every player available.
""Because injuries can happen, because rotations need to happen. Hopefully this season we can show that we are a strong squad.""
'We need to learn from previous seasons'
Zubimendi is a statement signing for the Gunners and it is hoped he can be the catalyst to help the club to begin a new era of winning trophies after coming so close in recent seasons.
""I hope so,"" said Zubimendi. ""The most important thing about this club is that they learn from previous seasons.
""I think the lessons they've learned from how last season ended will be key to getting even closer to this year's targets.
""Ultimately, I believe that football comes down to details, especially in the Champions League.
""I feel that Arsenal were the only team in that semi-final who truly stood up to PSG [Paris St-Germain], and they let it slip because of minor details.
""I also agree with Merino that it's a long season, and injuries play an important role, so the fewer we have, the better.""

Gascoigne 'doing well' after hospital stay,"Former England and Spurs midfielder Paul Gascoigne is ""doing well"" following a stay in hospital.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly84n2pmk6o,"Tue, 22 Jul 2025 15:13:46",Alex Fletcher,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Former England and Spurs midfielder Paul Gascoigne is ""doing well"" after a short stay in hospital, his representatives have said.
The 58-year-old was admitted to hospital after visiting the accident and emergency department on Friday.
His agency, MNT, said in a statement: ""Paul voluntarily went to A&E on Friday (not via ambulance) after struggling with a throat condition he has had for a while. He went home yesterday after a short stay and is resting up and doing well.""
The Sun, external had claimed on Sunday that Gascoigne had been ""rushed"" to an intensive care unit after he was found by a friend.
Gascoigne was capped 57 times by his country and is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers England has ever produced.
He began his career playing for boyhood club Newcastle United, before a move to Spurs in 1988 - where he won the FA Cup in 1991.
Gascoigne then signed for Lazio before returning to the UK where he played for Rangers, Middlesbrough and Everton.
Away from the pitch, Gascoigne has had well-documented struggles with alcohol addiction and depression since retiring in 2004.

Arsenal close to Gyokeres deal after add-ons delay,Arsenal are close to a deal for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres after negotiations over the finer details of the transfer took longer than expected.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8d6vj0759mo,"Tue, 22 Jul 2025 18:38:58",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal are on the verge of signing Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres after negotiations over the finer details of the transfer took longer than expected.
BBC Sport reported last week a £63.5m deal was in the final stages, with Arsenal hoping it would be done for the beginning of their pre-season tour of Asia, which starts on Sunday.
However, the move for the Sweden forward has been held up because of negotiations between the clubs over add-on payments.
Gyokeres has already agreed terms and a five-year contract with the Gunners.
The 27-year-old has been in demand during the summer transfer window after scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.
BBC Sport revealed earlier this month how Arsenal had turned their attentions to Gyokeres after hitting an impasse in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.
The search for a striker has been a drawn-out process for manager Mikel Arteta, who has been desperate to add an elite centre-forward after his side scored 17 fewer goals and finished 10 points behind champions Liverpool in the Premier League last season.
The Spaniard boosted his overall attacking options with the signing of England winger Noni Madueke, 23, from Chelsea last week.
Former Brighton and Coventry striker Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 matches during his two seasons in Portugal, helping Sporting lift back-to-back Primeira Liga titles.
During his time at Coventry, he was one of the most prolific strikers in the Championship.
In 116 appearances for the Sky Blues, he scored 43 goals. He was named in the Championship team of the year in 2022-23 as Coventry reached the play-off final, but were beaten on penalties by Luton Town.
That summer he moved to Portugal, signing for Sporting for about £20m.
He made his Sweden debut in 2019 against Finland and has 26 caps, scoring 15 goals.
Not just goals - what Gyokeres can bring to Arsenal
While Portugal's Primeira Liga is not as strong as England's Premier League, there is no doubt Gyokeres has shown he can be lethal in the box.
His shot conversion rate of 28.4% is similar to that of Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (29.2%) in his record-breaking 2022-23 season.
But though his goalscoring exploits have put the Sweden striker in such demand, Gyokeres has much more to his game.
He is known for his intelligent movement and intense work-rate, and his blend of physical strength, technical skill and tactical awareness have earned him admiring glances from clubs.
He is a provider as well as a goalscorer, with a lot of his chance creation coming from his love of running with the ball.
According to data from Opta, Gyokeres created 2.15 chances per 90 minutes last season, which translated to 1.42 goal contributions per game.

'A fierce competitor & loveable character' - Joey Jones obituary,"Former Wales, Liverpool and Wrexham defender Joey Jones was a ""fierce competitor and a loveable character"".",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c977x1nj3geo,"Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:13:56",,['Liverpool'],"Legendary former Wales, Liverpool and Wrexham defender Joey Jones, who has died at the age of 70, was a fierce competitor, a loveable character and a humble hero to fans of every team he represented.
A European Cup and league title winner with Liverpool in 1977, Jones spent most of his career with Wrexham and also played for Chelsea and Huddersfield Town.
He made 72 appearances for Wales and, at the time of his retirement from international football in 1986, was his country's most capped player.
After retiring as a player, Jones coached and managed Wrexham, where he first played as a professional.
Jones' lean frame and pipe-cleaner legs made him an unlikely hard man, but his uncompromising, tough-tackling style made him feared by attackers.
His trademark clenched-fist salute also made him a firm favourite with supporters wherever he played.
Brought up in Llandudno, Jones joined Wrexham in 1971 at the same time as another youngster from the north Wales coast who would become a great friend, Mickey Thomas.
Jones' first spell at Wrexham saw the club flourish under John Neal and claim many notable FA Cup wins.
His performances persuaded Liverpool manager Bob Paisley to sign the boyhood Reds fan for £110,000 in July 1975.
Liverpool supporters memorably unfurled a banner before the 1977 European Cup final against Borussia Monchengladbach, their all-star team having already beaten Saint Etienne and FC Zurich.
It read: ""Joey Ate The Frogs Legs, Made The Swiss Roll, Now He's Munching Gladbach.""
Jones told BBC Wales in 2014: ""It was made by a couple of fans who I really respected and I think as much of that banner as I do of the medal.
""To make a banner about myself, when there were such great players at Liverpool, made me feel 10ft tall.""
Chelsea fans speak fondly of his efforts to keep the club from falling into the old Third Division during the 1982-83 season and then helping them win the Second Division a year later.
He had been signed by his former Wrexham boss Neal and was reunited with ex-Robins team-mate Eddie Niedzwiecki as well as his old friend Thomas.
Liverpool supporters ranked him in the top 100 players to play for the club and he was voted player of the year by Huddersfield fans in 1986.
The feeling was mutual.
""I happen to believe, quite honestly, that the supporters are the most important people at any club,"" Jones said.
""Without them, there is no game and no job.""
His 100 games for the great Liverpool team of the late 1970s and 91 appearances for a struggling then resurgent Chelsea pale alongside his commitment to Wrexham.
Having first played for the north Wales club in 1971, Jones finally retired in 1992 having made 376 league appearances in three spells.
Afterwards he served as a coach at first team, reserve and youth level, and filled in as caretaker manager following the departure of Brian Flynn in 2001.
He made a full recovery from heart surgery in 2002 and continued in a full-time role working with the club's youth teams until he stepped down in 2017.
For Wales, for whom he made his debut against Austria in 1975, he was in teams that narrowly missed out on qualification for the 1978, 1982 and 1986 World Cups.
His international career spanned the changeover from the teams of John Toshack and Terry Yorath to the one of Ian Rush, Mark Hughes and Neville Southall.
The only goal for his country came in an extraordinary 4-4 draw in Yugoslavia in December 1983, which he later characteristically described as ""a magnificent 25-inch drive"".
Off the field Jones was as funny as he was tough on it.
Wales missed out on the 1982 World Cup finals, their hopes being ended by a defeat in the Soviet Union as Jones was given the runaround by Oleg Blokhin, the Ballon d'Or winner in 1975.
A reporter informed Jones after the game that Blokhin's mother had been a notable champion pentathlete and that his father was a competitive sprinter.
Jones was quick in his reply: ""Oh yeah? Well my dad's a hospital porter and my mam's a cleaner, what chance did I have of catching him?""
A true character of the game, his place in his country's football history is assured - the first Welshman to win a European Cup winner's medal.
And his popularity with Wrexham fans - he was voted their all-time cult hero by Football Focus viewers in 2005 - will endure even in the club's 'Hollywood' era.

Maguire to join Man Utd squad on Wednesday,Harry Maguire will link up with the Manchester United squad for their pre-season trip to the United States on Wednesday after initially being left out for personal reasons.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cddz178y843o,"Tue, 22 Jul 2025 17:40:09",Simon Stone in Chicago,['Manchester United'],"Harry Maguire will link up with the Manchester United squad on Wednesday for their pre-season trip to the United States after initially being left out for personal reasons.
Maguire featured in the goalless draw with Leeds in Stockholm, Sweden at the weekend but his name was not in the 32-man squad named by manager Ruben Amorim for matches against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.
However, in a social media post later on Tuesday, England defender Maguire confirmed he would be among the travelling squad.
""All is fine now. I will be travelling tomorrow to meet up with the squad. Thanks for your concern,"" he said.
Club sources did not explain the reason for Maguire's absence, but had said they expected the 32-year-old to link up with his team-mates before the trip ends on 3 August.
As expected, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were all left out and will train at Carrington as they look for new clubs.
New signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha will travel. Mbeumo only completed his £65m move from Brentford on Monday, while Cunha posted pictures around the recent birth of his second child.
Goalkeeper Andre Onana and defender Lisandro Martinez will be involved as they continue their recovery from recent injuries.
United confirmed Martinez is not yet fit enough to play or be involved in group training sessions following major knee surgery.
Onana hurt his hamstring at the start of pre-season training and is not expected to feature in any of the three games.
Dutch forward Joshua Zirkzee is also added to the squad that played against Leeds.
Seventeen-year-old defender Godwill Kukonki drops out but young quintet Sekou Kone, Reece Munro, Ethan Williams, Bendito Mantato and Jack Fletcher - son of former United midfielder and current Under-18s coach Darren - retain their places, which potentially offers an insight into Amorim's thinking before a first season without European football since 2014-15.
Manchester United play West Ham at MetLife Stadium, which hosted the recent Club World Cup final, in their first Premier League Summer Series game on 26 July. They play Bournemouth in Chicago on 30 July and Everton in Atlanta on 3 August.
Man Utd's 32-man squad
Goalkeepers: Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton, Dermot Mee, Andre Onana, Will Murdock.
Defenders: Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Patrick Dorgu, Leny Yoro, Luke Shaw, Ayden Heaven, Diego Leon, Tyler Fredricson, Reece Munro, Lisandro Martinez.
Midfielders: Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Jack Fletcher, Sekou Kone, Toby Collyer.

The Spain Under-21 defender will provide competition for William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes.
He can play at both centre-back and right-back and will fill the gap in the squad left by the departure of Takehiro Tomiyasu, who mutually agreed to terminate his contract.
Mosquera has made 90 appearances for Valencia and was a regular last season, playing the full match in 37 of the club's 38 La Liga games.
Arsenal face AC Milan in Singapore in the National Stadium on Wednesday before taking on Newcastle at the same venue on Sunday.

Football transfer rumours: Brentford exodus continues with Wissa to Newcastle?,Today’s rumours have left it late,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/23/football-transfer-rumours-brentford-yoane-wissa-force-newcastle-move,"Wed, 23 Jul 2025 07:28:11",Will Unwin,['Manchester United'],"Being on a pre-season tour can make or break a player’s future. Yoane Wissa has left Brentford’s after the club turned down a £25m bid for his services from Newcastle, as he is eager to have a natter with the head honchos at the Gtech Community Stadium to sort out his future. The forward wants to test himself in the Champions League and does not want to be held back by something as minor as a club being unwilling to pay his full valuation. It is expected that the Magpies will up their offer in the coming days to a fee in the region of £30m plus add-ons. The Bees are not particularly keen on losing another striker days after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United.
Mateo Joseph has told Daniel Farke and Leeds that he wants out of Elland Road. The Spain Under-21s striker did not travel with the rest of the squad for their pre-season jaunt to Germany. Joseph was the subject of a bid in excess of £10m from Real Betis but Leeds want more for their young striker. “He came to me and to us and said that he wants a new challenge and would like to have a move,” Farke said. “He has also hinted that he prefers a move to Spain due to his Spanish roots. And yes, obviously that was more or less his call.”
It was quite clear for the entirety of last season that West Ham needed to sign a new striker. It looks like that man could be Callum Wilson, who is available for absolutely nothing after leaving Newcastle at the end of his contract. Graham Potter may want to gloss over the fact Wilson scored only once in 22 appearances in all competitions last season.
Bayern Munich spent ages trying to sign João Palhinha from Fulham and then, like all these things, it did not work out as all parties imagined. The Portuguese midfielder was a bit-part player in his first year in the Bundesliga, meaning he could be looking for a way out. A return to London is one potential option, as Tottenham are monitoring Palhinha’s situation, which could possibly be summed up as: available for transfer.
It’s been a relatively quiet summer at the Hill Dickinson Stadium, but things could be about to get a little bit more interesting for Everton. David Moyes seems to fancy the Moroccan left-back Adam Aznou, currently at Bayern Munich, as he seeks competition for Vitalii Mykolenko.
Wolves have barely troubled the scorers at all but that looks set to change with the signing of the Fluminense winger Jhon Arias. They thought they would do likewise with the Almería right-back Marc Pubill after an agreement was made, but the defender looks set to join Atlético Madrid instead.
And down in League Two, the Notts County striker Alassana Jatta has had his head turned by interest from Casa Pia in Portugal, in addition to a League One and Turkish side. The Gambia international is eager to test himself at a higher level and has plenty of interest.

Big-spending Liverpool aim to build on their Premier League title success | Andy Hunter,"It appears a radical departure by FSG to build so ambitiously from a position of strength, while sending an ominous warning to their rivals",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/22/big-spending-liverpool-aim-to-build-on-their-premier-league-title-success,"Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:07:40",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Almost £300m worth of talent added to a squad that cruised to the Premier League title last season and Liverpool may not be spent yet. Whatever they’re smoking in Boston is having an unusual effect on a global fanbase.
Big-spending Liverpool, blowing competitors from Bayern Munich to Newcastle out of the water with their pulling and spending power, may be a strange reality for supporters who not so long ago sang: “The Reds have got no money, but we’ll still win the league.” The chant can be retired now that the first part is demonstrably untrue. It always was.
When Hugo Ekitiké completes his move from Eintracht Frankfurt, for a deal that Liverpool would be delighted to reach £79m because it would represent further success at club and individual level, the champions will have made two of the three biggest signings in their history in the space of five weeks. Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s Boston-based owner, would have been prepared to break the club’s transfer record twice in that timeframe but for Newcastle’s insistence that Alexander Isak is not for sale.
It appears a radical departure by FSG to build so ambitiously from a position of strength, while sending an ominous warning to Premier League rivals with designs on closing the gap. But Liverpool maintain there has been no change in strategy and that the club continue to be run along self-sustaining lines. The approach that enabled them to transform Jürgen Klopp’s team in 2018 by buying Alisson and Virgil van Dijk with the proceeds of Philippe Coutinho’s £142m sale to Barcelona has also shaped plans for sustained success under Arne Slot. The benefits of thinking long term have paid off. No profitability and sustainability issues here.
The answer to how Liverpool have been able to spend heavily this summer is dull, out of step with many clubs throughout the English football pyramid and anathema to those besotted with winning the transfer window over genuine prizes: financial discipline.
Liverpool last spent big in the summer of 2023 when rebuilding Klopp’s midfield to the tune of £145m while recouping £52m from the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson to the Saudi Pro League. Not a penny was spent in the January transfer windows of 2024 and 2025, and last summer, Slot’s first in charge, brought an outlay of only £10m for Federico Chiesa, the amount received from Salzburg for Bobby Clark. Liverpool made a profit of £42.5m last summer with the sales of Fábio Carvalho and Sepp van den Berg to Brentford (if taking the initial £25m for Valencia’s goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili – agreed 12 months ago – into this year’s expenditure). The club’s faith in the rebuilding work of 2023 explained their reticence to re-enter the market in three successive windows, and was vindicated with title No 20 in April.
The importance of Champions League qualification to Liverpool’s financial health was evident in their last set of published accounts, for the year to 31 May 2024, which showed a £57m loss mainly as a consequence of missing out that year and competing in the Europa League. Revenue for this year is projected to pass £700m for the first time with the club making more than £80m from the return to the Champions League and about £180m from the triumphant Premier League campaign. Matchday and commercial revenue will have increased as Liverpool continue to benefit from the redevelopments of the Main Stand and Anfield Road Stand.
This summer’s transfer business – with Ekitiké soon to join the record signing Florian Wirtz, Mamardashvili, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez, the young Hungarian goalkeeping prospect Armin Pecsi and goalkeeping cover Freddie Woodman – leaves the champions looking stronger on paper before their title defence. Any predictions for Liverpool this season, of course, must be tempered by the unknown and unimaginable factor of a team dealing with the tragic death of one of their own in Diogo Jota.
There is certainly greater depth and versatility to Slot’s squad, plus more opportunity to rotate beyond domestic cup competitions. Slot tended to stick with a trusted core of players in the Premier League last season. There is no disputing the methods of a coach who wins the title in his debut season at Liverpool with ease and four matches to spare, although Slot himself suspected fatigue played a part in the Carabao Cup final defeat by Newcastle.
Ekitiké, a France Under-21 international who scored 22 goals in his one and only season at Eintracht, may not be Liverpool’s final signing of a statement summer. The Premier League champions remain keen on Crystal Palace’s central defender Marc Guéhi and there would be appetite for another forward should Bayern eventually succeed in their pursuit of Luis Díaz.
Liverpool maintain Díaz is not for sale and that their €100m (£86.8m) valuation of the Colombia international is for accounting purposes rather than an asking price. That may be so but if that valuation is met and Díaz departs, and Liverpool get what they want for Darwin Núñez (£55m), Harvey Elliott (£40m-plus), Chiesa (£10m) and Tyler Morton (£15m), the club could yet recoup more than £200m before the transfer window closes on 1 September. A well-run champion does not ease up.

"Joey Jones, former Liverpool, Wrexham and Wales defender, dies aged 70","Jones won two European Cups, Uefa Cup and league title with Reds",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/22/joey-jones-former-liverpool-wrexham-and-wales-defender-dies-aged-70,"Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:41:47",Soccer,"['Chelsea', 'Liverpool']","The former Liverpool and Wales defender Joey Jones has died at the age of 70. Jones played 100 times in a trophy-laden spell at Liverpool, winning two European Cups, a Uefa Cup and a league title in three years.
The Llandudno-born left-back earned 72 caps for Wales, starting and ending his career at Wrexham after spells at Anfield, Chelsea and Huddersfield.
Jones’s former Wales teammate Mickey Thomas posted on X: “This morning I lost my best friend and soul mate, Sir Joey our memories will never fade – Today my heart is broken. Love you Sir Joey RIP. My condolences are with Janice and all the family.”
Jones’s contribution to Liverpool was immortalised in the “Joey ate the frogs legs, made the Swiss roll, now he’s munching Gladbach” banner revealed by fans at the 1977 European Cup final victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach. The banner was in reference to victories over Saint-Étienne and FC Zürich in the quarter- and semi-finals.
“I guarantee the Germans would have known every player in our team apart from me – just one of the lads who has come off the Kop,” he said of the banner, which after 20 years in his garage is now in Liverpool’s museum. “I guess that’s why the fans identified with me because I’d give it my all and I was one of them. I never considered myself to be skilful but I was the type of player I think any team needs. I think as much of that banner as I do the winner’s medal.”
With Wrexham, Jones won the Welsh Cup and helped the club reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1974. He had a brief spell as caretaker manager and remained a fixture at the Racecourse Ground even after his retirement: following heart surgery in 2002 and a minor stroke in 2015, he returned as youth-team ambassador in 2021.
A post from the club on X read: “Wrexham AFC are devastated to learn of the passing of Club legend Joey Jones. A true Club legend, on and off the pitch, with time for everybody he met, Joey will be greatly missed by all who knew him.”
A statement on the Football Association of Wales (FAW) website described Jones as “an iconic figure who defined a generation for the fans of Liverpool, Wrexham and Cymru”. It continued: “Despite his humble nature off the field, Jones will go down in history as one of the best defenders of his generation for what he achieved with Liverpool, but it was his dedication to the game, his no-nonsense style and his genuine love for the clubs that he represented that will forever endear him to the fans, and how they appreciated that he was so much like them with his desire just to play football.”
There were also tributes on X from the former Liverpool stars Jamie Carragher and John Aldridge and the FAW’s chief executive, Noel Mooney. Aldridge wrote: “What a lovely man and an inspirational full back who gave his heart and soul in a red shirt and for all the clubs he played for! Our thoughts are with Joey’s family! I’m a lucky man to have met him many times.”

Only real ones will remember Masters Football, the over-35s tournament for former pros hoping for one final moment in the limelight on Sky Sports in the early 2000s. Peter Beardsley’s performances in 2002 for Newcastle United were legendary, Jörg Albertz helped himself to a few more thunderb@stards for Rangers and how can we forget the vastly underrated Owen Coyle squealing “Coyle!” every time he took a shot. As they disappeared from our screens, charity fundraisers came to the fore. In Soccer Aid, Woody Harrelson being mobbed by Zinedine Zidane and Jens Lehmann after burying the winning penalty past England keeper Jamie Theakston for the Rest of the World XI was memorable, as was a certain tackle by future UK prime minister Boris Johnson on former Manchester City cult hero Maurizio Gaudino.
The point is, from half-time fan competitions (Tripgate, we’re looking at you) to Kerlon’s seal dribbling, there is a lot of room for football-based silliness and ingenuity in a game saturated with monotonous tactics and refereeing segments. And with that in mind, Football Daily’s attention turns to Kasi Flava, a maverick offshoot of the game originating in South Africa, where entertainment and showboating are as important as scoring.

Results, then, are important, but this is closer to an improvised, performative dance than a traditional match, an outpouring of joy played and watched by working-class people in the townships. “Kasi football is an art form, embedded in real-life human drama,” explains Tarminder Kaur, a senior lecturer at the University of Johannesburg. Bet you didn’t bank on reading actual quotes from an academic in Football Daily, but here we are.
Surely the best clip of the recent DStv eKasi Champs of Champs tournament, broadcast live on national television, is the winner scored by Mudagasi against Jukulyn in a 2-1 victory. Some of the moves are downright disrespectful: at one point Mudagasi’s players pretend to fall asleep on the ball, before their No 9 whips a genuinely brilliant Quaresma-esque trivela pass to a teammate, who neatly laces an expert finish into the far corner to send the crowd wild. Yes, please. Kasi football is not for everyone. And if you think René Higuita should have just caught the ball at Wembley in 1995 and Yannick Bolasie should have done less sweeping and more shooting, then this is probably not for you. But for this unserious, trivial tea-timely email, it’s the perfect antidote to yet another Tuesday.

QUOTE OF THE DAY
As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up” – Robbie Keane Bryan Mbeumo is psyched for the new season after joining the club he supported as a boy.
FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS
Manchester United’s propensity to offload football talent (yesterday’s Football Daily) didn’t start today or yesterday. The following is an XI composed of players released during the 2014-15 season alone: Johnstone S, Keane M, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Anderson, Fletcher, Kagawa, Zaha, Hernández, Welbeck. Many would back that side of cast-offs against anything else put out by United since then” – Brian Broderick.
Re: where the north starts (Football Daily letters passim). I would like to suggest that based on the membership of the National League North, then it starts at Bedford, because they were promoted into the league this season, even though Bedford is just 57 miles from the middle of London. Two seasons ago, Bishop’s Stortford were members of the league, and they’re based at the end of Stansted airport’s runway. They used to love midweek games in the north-east. To extend the discussion, Merthyr Tydfil are playing in National League North this season, so where does north Wales start?” – Ray Simpson.
Regarding Jon Millard’s submission that ‘the north starts at Sheffield, indisputably, as did football, also undisputedly. I’d love to say this is the one thing Noble will agree with me on, but he’d probably email in and say it’s bloody Woodall, or something’ (yesterday’s letters). He’s clearly right on football, indisputably. The north is more complex. When I was young, we used to just say that Chesterfield was the dividing line but then we thought that Bob Holness played the sax on Baker Street (false) and that he was the first person to play James Bond (false, he was the second) so what did we know? The north is very south Sheffield and just above Chesterfield so you’re looking more at a broad line of Killamarsh, Eckington, Lowedges, Totley. And, yes, that line includes Woodall” – Noble Francis.
I see that, according to Jason Wilcox, new signing Bryan Mbeumo is ‘the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing’. That’s rather harsh criticism, isn’t it, on the lad’s first day?” – Phil Taverner.

England fans made to sweat on another hair-raising night of drama for Lionesses | Nick Ames,"After the nail-biting Sweden quarter-final, it was the same again as England somehow battled back to beat Italy and reach the Euro 2025 final",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/23/england-fans-made-to-sweat-another-hair-raising-night-of-drama-for-lionesses-euro-2025,"Tue, 22 Jul 2025 23:03:35",Nick Ames,['Arsenal'],"This time they needed only one penalty, although even that came with complications. England are through to the Euro 2025 final and, in keeping with the white-knuckle nature of their tournament, that tells only a fraction of the story.
Sarina Wiegman’s team were moments from losing against an unfancied Italy who had played the role of underdog to perfection, holding on to their first-half lead with an exemplary tactical performance. England looked down and out until Michelle Agyemang, the young Arsenal striker, seized on a loose ball and finished clinically in injury time. The Lionesses had got out of jail again and the breaks did not end there.
Half an hour of extra time had almost ticked down, the spectre of a second consecutive penalty shootout looming ominously. England had scraped through their quarter-final by that means in a deeply flawed epic against Sweden and few inside a tense, taut Stade de Genève had any appetite to endure that maelstrom of emotions again. Then Beth Mead was fouled in the Italy box: it was a needless offence and England had their shot at glory, although their past record from the spot meant it came with precious few guarantees.
The usually reliable Chloe Kelly stepped up but her strike was parried by Laura Giuliani. Time stood still as the ball ran loose and Kelly, characteristically sharp, got there first to sweep in a winner England had barely deserved. Wiegman, a concerned figure on the touchline for much of the night as her players stared down the barrel of elimination, leapt into the air. England’s substitutes and support staff tore down the touchline and minds raced giddily enough to wonder whether it is written in the stars that they retain their European Championship title.
To do that they must beat either Germany or the hot favourites, Spain, on Sunday. Their opponents will be known on Wednesday night and the one certainty is that they must perform more cohesively than they managed for long periods here. Agyemang had also bailed them out with a late equaliser against the Swedes; she has written herself into England folklore at the age of 19 but there will surely be less margin for error against one of the continent’s superpowers.
Legends are made on nights such as this. England’s travelling supporters celebrated deliriously long after the final whistle; huge sections of the venue had already dissolved into a mush of limbs when Agyemang struck. Those fans will be able to march proudly, expectantly, one last time before the tournament decider in Basel.
Hundreds of them had assembled at a fanzone near Lancy-Pont-Rouge station to take the mile-long walk towards the stadium, counting down before setting off at 6.45pm to trumpets and beating drums. There had been plenty to entertain them while they waited, including an impromptu limbo dancing competition between tied-together English and Italian flags. This being Geneva, food stalls selling chips and hot dogs were joined by another offering oysters, salmon tartare and moules frites.
Waving their unmistakable Tricolour, a section of Italy fans snaked their way through England’s contingent to begin a march of their own. They were greeted by good-natured boos; in truth, both camps had mixed amenably throughout the afternoon, in keeping with the playful but passionate feeling fostered all month.
Among those gathered were Sam and Beth from Worthing in West Sussex. They marched holding a flag, emblazoned with Brighton & Hove Albion’s crest, that bore the words “We stand with Jess”. The phrase referred to Jess Carter, the England defender who had opened up during the weekend about the horrific racist abuse she has recently experienced via social media.

“It has to be said,” Sam explained of her supportive message, which she had painted the previous day in the pair’s Airbnb. She predicted a morale-boosting 4-0 win for England, although they both noted the stress of that Sweden rollercoaster. They could not quite have expected a similar blend of agony and ecstasy this time.
Before the game Wiegman had warned against complacency. The message was pressed home that, should anyone be expecting a free pass to the final, a rude awakening lay in store. But England were sloppy in the first half, missing chances against Andrea Soncin’s fiery competitors and going behind to a well-executed blast from Barbara Bonansea.
Their efforts to claw a route back appeared to have stalled and they needed to thank their goalkeeper Hannah Hampton for a remarkable double save before Agyemang’s intervention. Hampton is another hero to have emerged from the past three weeks and joined her teammates in the melee when England’s place in the final was confirmed.
They celebrated with pizza while friends and family, undeterred by the stadium’s dimming lights, soaked it all in long after the end. The biggest moment of awe and wonder may, against the odds, be yet to come.
