Fernandes critical of 'lazy' Man Utd display and hopes for 'one or two' more signings,"Bruno Fernandes was critical of Man Utd's ""lazy"" display in their 2-2 Premier League Summer Series draw with Everton before calling for further reinforcements in the transfer window.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13406594/bruno-fernandes-critical-of-lazy-man-utd-display-against-everton-and-hopes-for-one-or-two-more-signings,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 00:28:00",,['Manchester United'],"Bruno Fernandes was critical of Man Utd's ""lazy"" display in their 2-2 Premier League Summer Series draw with Everton before calling for further reinforcements in the transfer window.
Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.
Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.
The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.
When asked about the success of Man Utd's tour to America and the display against Everton, Fernandes said: ""It's been positive. It's been positive to be together to create a bond between the players.
""It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.
""We didn't want to finish in this way,"" The United skipper added. ""Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.
""We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.""
The positives for United against Everton was a first appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford.
He combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha on a number of occasions during the first half, showing the benefit of new additions to the squad.
However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.
""It's improving,"" he said. ""But it's not the place it needs to be.
""I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.
""But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.
""Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.""
Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: ""I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.
""One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.""
After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.
He said: ""Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.
""You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.
""The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.
""It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.
""A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.""
Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.
He said: ""We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.
""I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.
""We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].""
Reflecting on Mbeumo's debut, Amorim added: ""He played well. He needs to understand the position, the movement but the first touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.
""You can see he's not in the perfect condition physically but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team so everything I was expecting, he delivered.""

Frank: 'Brutal' Maddison injury looks bad,"James Maddison was stretchered off for Tottenham in their pre-season friendly draw with Newcastle in South Korea - in what Thomas Frank described as a ""brutal"" injury.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13406271/james-maddison-injury-tottenham-hotspur-midfielder-stretchered-off-during-pre-season-game-with-newcastle-in-south-korea,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 14:10:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"James Maddison was stretchered off for Tottenham in their pre-season friendly draw with Newcastle in South Korea - in what Thomas Frank described as a ""brutal"" injury.
Maddison was later pictured leaving the stadium on crutches.
The Spurs midfielder came on as a 75th-minute substitute and was only on the pitch for nine minutes before he started hobbling intensely and appearing in real discomfort.
Maddison looked distraught - with his head in his hands - as he was stretchered off the pitch. It is the same knee that saw the England international miss the end of last season, including Spurs' Europa League final triumph.
After the game, Frank described Maddison's latest injury as a ""brutal"" - as it marred an emotional afternoon with departing Spurs captain Heung-Min Son given a guard of honour by both sets of players as he was substituted off in his home country before his expected Spurs departure.
""I think sometimes in life and football things can be both beautiful and brutal,"" said the Spurs boss. ""That's what we got today.
""It looks like with Madders a bad injury and then on the other side unbelievable scenes for Son from his team-mates and the respect from the Newcastle players.""
This is another injury setback for the midfielder - who had only just returned from a long-term knee problem sustained at the end of May.
Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:
Tottenham were already looking for a new attacking midfielder in this transfer window - this Maddison blow, if as bad as feared, means they need one even more now.
Spurs tried to bring in Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest by activating his £60m release clause. But Evangelos Marinakis' side managed to prevent the deal from happening by first threatening legal action against Tottenham and the player's agent - before then convincing the England international to sign a new contract.
Attacking midfield is also an area where Spurs are short. Dejan Kulusevski is set to miss the start of the season as he recovers from the knee surgery he had in May. Departing captain Son's attacking spot may also need to be replaced.
Spurs do have a temporary attacking midfield solution in Pape Sarr, who has been scoring from a more advanced position during pre-season, while new £55m signing Mohammed Kudus can play in central areas.
But with Destiny Udogie and Dominic Solanke also out injured at the moment, Spurs' injury problems that plagued their campaign last term have carried over into the current campaign.
With new boss Frank looking to improve Spurs' ability to compete on multiple fronts, this is not the best start to life in north London.

Spurs sign Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich,"Tottenham have signed Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, with an option to buy the midfielder at the end of the season for &#163;27m.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13404972/joao-palhinha-transfer-news-tottenham-complete-loan-deal-for-bayern-munich-midfielder-with-option-to-buy,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 20:10:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have signed Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, with an option to buy the midfielder at the end of the season for £27m.
Palhinha makes a Premier League return, one year after he joined Bayern from Fulham for a fee worth up to £47.4m.
The 30-year-old midfielder has three years remaining on his current Bayern contract.
The loan deal gives Spurs flexibility to spend funds elsewhere this summer, with a priority to bolster the attacking positions, particularly after James Maddison's injury, while they also want to add a full-back and a No 10.
“When I knew of the interest from Tottenham, I didn’t need to think about it too much. I just wanted to come (here),” Palhinha told Spursplay.
“The coach (Thomas Frank) is probably the main thing which had more of an impact on my decision – when you feel that someone wants you, it means a lot and you are closer to making an easy decision.
“I will try to help to show again what I am capable to do it. Now my home is here (in London) and I will try to enjoy these moments with my family.”

Spurs and Bayern are on good terms after doing deals for Harry Kane, Eric Dier and Mathys Tel in recent seasons.
Palhinha made 25 appearances across all competitions for Bayern last season, including 17 outings in the Bundesliga as Vincent Kompany's side went on to become champions.
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
""Joao Palhinha left the Premier League last summer as the toughest tackler in the top flight. His total of 152 tackles was more than any other player by a distance and was the standout trait of the Fulham enforcer. There were 13 yellows in that 2023/24 season, too, underlining the bite he brings to midfield battles. And that would be a welcome addition to Spurs' play.
""Neither Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr nor Rodrigo Bentancur are as ruthless at winning the ball back as Palhinha, who also ranked among the top 10 for interceptions during his previous Premier League campaign.
""Palhinha's belated move to Bayern Munich didn't prove to be worth the wait, with an injury disruptive and head coach Vincent Kompany ultimately leaving him on the fringes. But a return to London looks like a smart switch for the Portuguese and Spurs - and a daunting one for opposition midfielders.""
Tottenham boss Thomas Frank admitted the club are ""looking"" for further additions in the summer transfer window.
Spurs have already secured the signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, as well as Kota Takai and Luka Vuskovic.
Kevin Danso and Mathys Tel have also seen their initial loan moves converted into permanent deals.
However, Frank's side missed out on Morgan Gibbs-White after the England international signed a new three-year deal at the City Ground.
Forest accused Spurs of making an illegal approach for the midfielder with a £60m bid earlier this month.
Speaking in his first press conference since being appointed to the role, Frank commented on further incomings, saying: ""There is no doubt that, if you want to compete in all tournaments, you need a competitive squad.
""There are a lot of competitive players in the squad already. The club is in the market and looking.
""What will happen, I will speak when a player comes into the building.""

Chelsea sign defender Hato from Ajax to take spending past £250m,Chelsea have completed the signing of teenage defender Jorrel Hato from Ajax to take their summer spending beyond &#163;250m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13405232/jorrel-hato-transfer-news-chelsea-sign-teenage-defender-from-ajax-for-an-initial-35-5m-plus-add-ons,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 18:05:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have completed the signing of teenage defender Jorrel Hato from Ajax to take their summer spending beyond £250m.
The Blues will pay an initial fee of £35.5m plus add-ons for the 19-year-old, who has signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge.
Ajax announced the two clubs had agreed on a deal worth £38.5m (€44.18m) for Hato.
The Netherlands international fits into Chelsea's strategy of signing young developing players on low base wages and on heavily incentivised contracts.
The Club World Cup champions have been keen to sign Hato as he can also provide cover for Marc Cucurella at left-back, who played nearly 70 games last season for Chelsea and Spain.
Hato, who will join up with his new Chelsea team-mates this week, became the third-youngest player ever to debut for Ajax in the Eredivisie, aged 16, and then captained Ajax as a 17-year-old.
He told Chelsea's official website: ""I'm very excited, I'm so happy to be here.
""I thought a lot about my future and wanted to take the next step in my career. Chelsea is the best place for me to do that so I'm very happy.""
Hato becomes Chelsea's eighth summer signing following the arrivals of Joao Pedro (£60m), Jamie Gittens (£51.1m), Liam Delap (£30m), Estevao Willian (£29.1m), Dario Essugo (£18.5m), Mamadou Sarr (£12m) and Kendry Paez (£17.3m).
Chelsea's spending this summer has now broken the £250m mark, with Liverpool the only Premier League side to have spent more (£295.5m).
Enzo Maresca's side could still make more additions this summer, with Chelsea in talks over signing RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons.
Meanwhile, Ajax's technical director, Alex Kroes, revealed they wanted to keep Hato for ""at least another year"".
He told the Dutch club's official website: ""With Jorrel's departure, we lose one of our key figures in defence.
""He is not only a tremendous talent and a great player, but he also has an excellent character and personality.
""Ideally, we would have liked to keep him for at least another year, but we understand that he has now set his sights on this exciting adventure awaiting him in the Premier League.
""We wholeheartedly wish him well with this new challenge, are proud of what he has done for Ajax, and wish him every success in England.""

Al Nassr fail in attempt to sign Man Utd captain Fernandes,Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr have failed in an attempt to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13406396/bruno-fernandes-transfer-news-al-nassr-fail-in-attempt-to-sign-manchester-united-captain,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 16:17:00",,['Manchester United'],"Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr have failed in an attempt to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes.
Contact was made through intermediaries, but there was no formal approach to Man Utd from Al Nassr, whose captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, is a Portugal team-mate of Fernandes.
The Man Utd midfielder rejected the chance to join Saudi Pro League rivals Al Hilal earlier this summer.


Al Hilal had been willing to almost treble Fernandes' £250,000-a-week wages, having been prepared to pay Man Utd £100m to sign the club's captain.
But the 30-year-old turned down their offer as he did not want to move to Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.
Manchester United do not want to sell their captain, who has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year.
The Portugal international has contributed 98 goals and 87 assists in 290 games in all competitions since moving to Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020.
Fernandes has been in good form on Man Utd's pre-season tour of the USA, scoring both goals in the 2-1 win over West Ham.
Fernandes confirmed in early June that he had rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and revealed how talks with his wife and Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim were key in his decision.
Fernandes told a Portugal press conference: ""The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask about the possibility of me moving there.
""I had to wait a while to think about the future. As I've always said, I would be willing to do it if United thought it was best to move on.
""I spoke with Ruben Amorim, who really tried to talk me out of it.
""I spoke to the club, who said they weren't willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave.
""From my side, it was a very ambitious proposal, the president was a fantastic person. I never talked about the money, it ended up coming up later, with my agent.
""I had to make the decision as a family and understand what I wanted for my future. That was the question my wife asked, what my professional goals would be. At no point did she say yes or no, she always supported me and put my professional side first.
""It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Ruben Neves, Joao Cancelo. My children are used to playing with theirs.
""But I simply want to stay at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, because I still feel capable of that.
""I want to continue to be happy and do what I love most. I'm still very passionate about this sport. It's my way of seeing football and I'm happy with my decision.""

Man Utd join Newcastle in race for Sesko as talks begin,Newcastle United and Manchester United are in talks with RB Leipzig over the signing of striker Benjamin Sesko.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13406137/benjamin-sesko-transfer-news-manchester-united-join-newcastle-in-holding-talks-with-rb-leipzig-over-forward,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:12:00",,['Manchester United'],"Newcastle United and Manchester United are in talks with RB Leipzig over the signing of striker Benjamin Sesko.
Newcastle made their move on Saturday with an offer worth £69.8m including add-ons. Discussions continue over the structure of that deal.
There is no official bid from Man Utd yet. Their negotiations surround what they would be prepared to pay and how they would pay it. A decision on whether a formal bid goes in will be based on those talks.
Man Utd's pre-season preparations continue on Sunday in the Premier League Summer Series against Everton at 10pm, live on Sky Sports Premier League.
Sesko is understood to be open to both projects, but one source has told Sky Sports News he is leaning towards Manchester United.
It was thought Man Utd would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.
It is understood that RB Leipzig are interested in striker Rasmus Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking Hojlund on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.
United could consider suitable offers for Hojlund, provided they are right for the club and the player.
Hojlund has started both games on the club's pre-season tour of the US and has publicly said he wants to stay and fight for his place, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.
A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.
Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has reportedly told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.
Marcel Schafer, RB Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko on Saturday.
""We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,"" he said.
Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.
Newcastle's bid for Sesko comes with the Magpies bracing themselves for a second offer from Liverpool for Alexander Isak.
Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe confirmed the club rejected a bid from Liverpool for Isak, but is unsure on what will happen next.
Sky Sports News understands Liverpool's opening offer for Isak was £110m plus add-ons. However, the total offer did not reach £120m. Newcastle are braced for a second offer.
Isak returned to Newcastle on Saturday following his personal training camp in Spain.
The Newcastle striker has been training at Real Sociedad's training headquarters on his own, after refusing to travel with Newcastle on their pre-season tour of Asia. Isak reported a thigh injury and travelled to San Sebastián to recover with his own staff.
Eddie Howe said on Saturday morning in South Korea that he found out Isak had travelled to Spain via the media.
""From my situation I am very much removed from what was happening back home,"" Howe said in a press conference ahead of facing Tottenham on Sunday in South Korea.
""I was made aware of a bid yesterday and that bid was turned down all before I even heard about it. People back in England are dealing with the situation.
""I really don't know what happens next. From our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.
""It is difficult because you don't know what is going to happen. There can be all sorts of talk and hypothetical situations but then you are dealing with reality.
""The reality is we had the first bid from Liverpool yesterday. I believe that was turned down, from this point onwards let's see what happens.
""I have no idea to try to predict that. In terms of trying to upset players, from my perspective, we can only talk about us, we try to do things the right way, signing players is always complex, we just try to do what we think is right. I can't talk about other clubs, that is not for me to say.""
Howe has added Newcastle are only ""looking for the best"" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.
Not only have the Magpies been hit with Isak's desire to leave, but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.
Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, but the Brentford striker is still not featuring for Keith Andrews' first team.
With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their only recognised first-team striker on their pre-season tour of Asia.
""We're looking for the best players that we can get,"" said Howe. ""Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us.
""I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.
""It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change till the window shuts.""

Pep talks - how Klopp's ex-assistant is shaping Man City,Manchester City have spent more than £150m on players this summer but Pep Guardiola's biggest signing could be Jurgen Klopp's old assistant.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2ker2n476o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:25:04",Alex Keble,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City have spent more than £150m on five new players this summer but Pep Guardiola's biggest signing did not cost a penny - and he will not play any football, either.
In early June, the second-most important coaching figure of Jurgen Klopp-era Liverpool became Guardiola's right-hand man at Manchester City.
Really, it should have been a bigger news story, not least because hiring Pep Lijnders - a man credited with most of the day-to-day training under Klopp, as well as a substantial part of the German's tactical evolution post-Borussia Dortmund - suggests Guardiola is considering a major tactical overhaul.
But what's even more remarkable is that those tactical changes will be navigated with the substantial input of a coach who worked with Klopp on concepts like counter-pressing and attacking in vertical lines; on concepts that served as the antidote to Guardiola's famous positional play.
That contrast is often overstated, mind. Guardiola and Klopp borrowed from one another, and their shared peaks at Liverpool and Man City almost seem to merge into one perfect blend of Klopp's dynamism and Guardiola's control.
On the one hand Klopp's 'heavy metal' football was tamed by an appreciation of territorial dominance, on the other Guardiola used Klopp's ideas to adapt to the rough-and-tumble of Premier League life.
Nevertheless Lijnders, like Klopp, is far more concerned than Guardiola with aggressive, high-octane attacking football and the opportunities that open up when the ball changes hands.
Until now. Because from the outside looking in, Lijnders' appointment appears to confirm Guardiola thinks modern Premier League football is moving in the direction of the old Kloppites. And he's right.
It used to be the case that Guardiola's territorial suffocation would pin back inferior opponents but, as the middle-class teams got better, those who were bold enough to press hard and disrupt the build-up play started to see rewards.
They quite literally pushed back, until pressing hard and maximising transitions spread across the division and even Guardiola struggled to control things with slow passing and rigid positioning.
""Today, modern football is the way Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton and Liverpool play,"" Pep Guardiola told TNT Sports a few months ago. ""Modern football is not positional. You have to ride the rhythm.""
That's a huge statement from the man whose 'positional play' tactical philosophy pretty much defined the past 15 years of the sport, but it's spot on.
Over the past five years fast breaks and direct attacks are on the rise, while PPDA - a measure of pressing frequency and intensity, where a lower score means greater pressure - is going down.
When Guardiola made those comments about modern football he was already beginning to experiment with a subtly more direct style of play.
Comparing their 2023-24 to 24-25 campaigns, City's possession share dropped from 65.5% to 61.3% while their total number of fast breaks jumped from 22 to 30, a rise of 36%.
Most prominently, we saw more long balls from Ederson to bypass the opposition high press and more direct dribbling through the lines from January signing Omar Marmoush.
Marmoush, by the looks of things, was the first signing of Man City 2.0: the rebuild that will shift Guardiola, Lijnders and City into a more Klopp-like direction. More players in that mould have since followed.
Rayan Cherki and Tijjani Reijnders have arrived from Lyon and AC Milan respectively and both signings, like Marmoush, point to more carrying of the ball through the lines and fewer neatly choreographed passing triangles.
To put it more simply, Cherki, Reijnders, and Marmoush are the kind of players who prefer to ride the rhythm.
The data here is stark. Compared with Man City's three most commonly used central midfielders in 2024-25, Cherki, Reijnders, and Marmoush scored considerably higher for 'progressive carries' (a carry of the ball at least five metres towards the opponent's goal) and 'attempted dribbles'.
Signing Rayan Ait-Nouri also alludes to Klopp-esque - or Lijnders-esque – football, because having mostly deployed central midfielders or centre-backs in the full-back positions over the past two seasons - an obvious nod to control, order, and discipline - Guardiola has emphatically changed direction.
Ait-Nouri is one of the most attacking full-backs in Europe. Similar to the other three 2025 signings we have discussed, he ranked second for dribbles completed among defenders in the Premier League last season (63) and sixth among full-backs for progressive carries (89).
But more impressively, he was within the top three among defenders for goal involvements (11), expected assists (5.5) and touches in the opposition box (96).
Ait-Nouri's arrival tells us Guardiola is done with packing midfielders into the team and is ceding some control in favour of more urgent, vertical attacking football.
Just like that, Manchester City fans can go from worrying about their team's slow and passive football to wondering how such an explosive attacking pair as Ait-Nouri and Jeremy Doku could work together on the left, or how Marmoush and Cherki will fit into the same attacking midfield space.
They will certainly have more questions than answers before the 2025-26 Premier League campaign gets under way, because most of their new arrivals - on the pitch and in the dugout - just don't fit the usual Pep archetype.
Clearly Guardiola is working on something new. With Lijnders at his side, it could be his sharpest left turn yet.

Green shoots for Man Utd or another false dawn?,"Manchester United have looked better in pre-season - are they green shoots of recovery, or is it another false dawn?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ceqyj7lxznlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 06:58:02",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have been so underwhelming, so erratic and talked so many good games over the past decade without delivering, it is sensible to watch closely to see if any green shoots of recovery continue to grow before passing judgement.
Ruben Amorim is wise to this.
He knows his searingly honest appraisal of United and his welcome openness in outlining how he is trying to improve things will count for absolutely nothing if they lose to Arsenal at Old Trafford in their Premier League season opener on 17 August.
He also knows United tend to attract extreme reactions, and said as much after Sunday's 2-2 draw against Everton in Atlanta confirmed his side as winners of the four-team Premier League Summer Series.
""It's normal in our club,"" he said.
""If you play well, they will say we play really well, if it's on the opposite side, it's the same thing.""
After four minutes of speaking to the press - not even a sixth of the time he spent with travelling UK journalists in Chicago on Friday - he was gone, choosing instead to watch the non-starting members of his squad - Joshua Zirkzee, Noussair Mazraoui, Andre Onana and Lisandro Martinez were not involved at any point - do a full training session on the Mercedes-Benz Stadium pitch.
Woe betide anyone who didn't meet Amorim's standards.
It is a big part of Amorim's coaching strategy to treat his players like adults. This seems sensible, although this is football we are talking about and even in Sir Alex Ferguson's day one player - who is still close to the club - turned up for a European trip with all his house keys, having locked the door with the rest of his family still inside, and had to sheepishly ask another employee to go back and let them out.
The sight of United players wandering round Chicago after training - either for a coffee, a bite to eat or a browse through the very expensive shops that make up the 'magnificent mile', without being accompanied by security, suggested a healthy dose of normality, which, as Amorim makes clear, comes with responsibility.
Players posed for numerous selfies - plenty of fans asked and no-one refused - when they were out and about around the team hotel. Letting the dressing room run the dressing room served Ferguson well.
It has made for a more relaxed environment. This is a contrast to the prescriptive approach of Erik ten Hag, who punished players if they were late for meetings.
That is not to say punishments don't exist in Amorim's world.
Defeat in the small-sided games at the end of training means having to pack away the training equipment. And in his revealing chat on Friday, Amorim said poor performance in training is identified and shown to the entire group rather than the individual concerned being singled out for a quiet word.
There are other subtleties too. Training on day one was at 8am to allow a transition through a six-hour time zone swap, in the knowledge Amorim will have his squad back together at Carrington on Wednesday before Saturday lunchtime's friendly with Fiorentina - disruption caused by a change in time zones should be easier.
It means Amorim was getting up even earlier to do his morning exercise, a run and weights, before the players arrived.
Training itself consisted of more intense gym work, lasting up to an hour, and walking through game scenarios - which Amorim takes and club media are not allowed to film.
Information is kept to key points rather than risk overload, where no messages get through. It is the general framework Amorim is trying to create. The players, he feels, should have the intelligence to make decisions themselves in key moments.
This means not all the key work takes place on the pitches. Amorim's assistant Carlos Fernandes does the set-pieces and drill work. The previous tradition of double sessions to build fitness have been ditched.
In addition, some of the running being asked of the players has been disguised. Two shooting drill stations were created at training but the gap between them was widened so more energy was expended to get between the two.
On the surface, all this seems positive. Certainly, reports from inside the club say the sports science team were delighted with the numbers from the early training sessions after Amorim's players returned for the start of pre-season on 7 July.
This, they reasoned, suggested the players had stuck to a pretty detailed and strict fitness programme to work on during their time off.
This is Manchester United, so there were some commercial appearances, but they have reduced from previous tours.
In fact, potentially the most significant commercial event as far as the club was concerned had no player involvement at all as Lord Coe, chair designate of the Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) for the Old Trafford regeneration project, was part of a delegation who addressed an audience of Wall Street investment banks and US financiers in New York to try to generate interest in helping to fund the planned £2bn new stadium project.
The fact neither Coe nor chief operating officer Collette Roche, who spoke at length to travelling media about the stadium plans in Los Angeles 12 months earlier, met the press this time suggests strongly nothing significant has changed and the feeling is growing United will not meet an initial five-year timeline minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke of in March.
That is not Amorim's concern, of course.
He must deliver on the pitch. And to that end, United did look much better than last season.
It was obvious the much-discussed three-man defence splits when Amorim's team have the ball so, when the build-up begins, the right and left-sided defenders operate as normal central defenders with the middle man of the three - Matthijs de Ligt is in pole position for that role - moves into midfield alongside the deeper of the two chosen for those jobs.
Matheus Cunha definitely brings more invention to Amorim's attack and Amad Diallo, if selected, is a massive danger offensively at right wing-back, even if questions are asked defensively.
It is clear Amorim feels he can find an upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, even if many would argue a better use of the funds United do have would be to find someone who can bring physicality and energy to midfield.
Watching the industry of Bournemouth's Alex Scott emphasises it is a significant weakness in Amorim's squad.
Nevertheless, as tours go, this has been a fairly calm one. Amorim's group of players, in general, seem happy enough and the positive spirit needed for any team to be successful does exist.
Yet the reality of modern football is that everything in seen through, and judged by, the prism of results.
The walk through might be an advancement. If United win it will be seen that way. If they lose it will be written off as a terrible idea - even though it is the exactly the same process.
Conceding the winning goal to Tottenham in the Europa League final through a flick off Brennan Johnson - that took a deflection at close range off Luke Shaw and then squeezed in at the corner despite Onana's desperate attempt to keep it out - has nothing to do with training and everything to do with the small margins managers across the league talk about.
This does seem to be a better United. Amorim is getting his ideas across.
But Arsenal's upcoming visit to Old Trafford and the 37 Premier Leagues games afterwards will decide whether the progress is real or if pre-season 2025 was just another false dawn.

Son makes emotional Spurs farewell - how much will they miss him?,Son Heung-min makes an emotional farewell in what is expected to be the final game of his 10-year Tottenham career.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c79ld2n9d4qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 07:21:58",Harry Poole,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Son Heung-min made an emotional farewell as he played what is expected to be the final game of his Tottenham career in front of his adoring home supporters in Seoul.
He is in advanced negotiations with Major League Soccer (MLS) side Los Angeles FC and is expected to join for a fee in the region of £20m.
The South Korea forward was embraced by his Spurs team-mates and the opposing Newcastle players, and they performed a guard of honour when he was substituted in the 65th minute.
Having handed the captain's armband to Ben Davies, 33-year-old Son was welcomed off the pitch by the backroom staff and substitutes before he took his place on the bench, resting his head in his hands as he fought back tears.
Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said: ""The reaction was instinctive from my players.
""That speaks volumes about him. It's not just the talent he has but the way he has carried himself over the years.
""He's seen as one of the game's great Premier League players.""
Son said on Saturday that he had made ""the most difficult"" decision of his career in choosing to leave Spurs after 10 years.
The pre-season friendly finished 1-1 at the Seoul World Cup Stadium.
""I didn't think I was going to cry at first,"" Son said.
""But after hearing a few words from my teammates, leaving the club I've spent so much time with felt really tough.
""I felt really, really happy playing this match. Thanks to my fans, my teammates and also my opponents, I've had an unforgettable day.
""My career is not over yet, and I want to continue to bring (the fans) joy. I know I have more things I want to accomplish as a football player.""
There was an injury concern for new Tottenham manager Thomas Frank after midfielder James Maddison was taken off on a stretcher only 10 minutes after coming on.
Frank said: ""Sometimes in life and football things can be both beautiful and brutal.
""That's what we got today. It looks like a bad injury (for Maddison) and then, on the other side, unbelievable scenes for Son from his team-mates and the respect from the Newcastle players.
""First we had the walkaround and then the team-mates gathered around and he was emotional.
""In the changing room it was more of the same. I just said a few things but not much because it's about Sonny. Then he said a few things. It was beautiful.""
Son became the most expensive Asian signing in Premier League history when he joined Spurs from Bayer Leverkusen for about £22m in 2015.
A club legend, he helped Spurs end their 17-year wait for a trophy in May, captaining them to victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final.
Frank, who had said during a press conference on Saturday that saying goodbye in South Korea would provide ""a beautiful ending"" for Son, said after the match that it was ""very likely Sonny's last game because [a move is] very close"".
Spurs play Bayern Munich in Germany on Thursday and contest the Uefa Super Cup against Paris St-Germain the following week.
The expectant crowd in Seoul cheered excitedly whenever Son touched the ball.
Brennan Johnson paid tribute to Son by copying his celebration - in which he mimics taking a photo - after he opened the scoring from the edge of the penalty area in the fourth minute.
Harvey Barnes equalised before half-time, beating keeper Antonin Kinsky at his near post.
How much will Spurs miss Son?
Son's statistics speak for themselves: 173 goals - the fifth highest for Spurs - and 101 assists in 454 games, with his 127 Premier League goals the joint 16th highest in the competition's history.
He holds the Spurs record for Premier League assists with 71, and in 2021-22 became the first Asian player to win the competition's Golden Boot, which he shared with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah on 23 goals.
After Spurs' record goalscorer Harry Kane moved to Bayern Munich in 2023, Son scored 17 goals and recorded 10 assists in 35 league games the following season.
Last season was the first in which Son, the club's three-time player of the year, failed to reach double figures for league goals since his debut campaign as Spurs finished one place above the relegation zone.
But goals should not be the only metric by which Son's influence is measured.
His 0.38 assists per 90 minutes in the league last term was his best return yet, as was his 0.68 big chances created per 90 - the fifth-highest in the league last season of players to play over 1,000 minute.
Perhaps the most telling stats are those which point to his impact on the rest of the team.
Spurs won 42% of the 24 league games Son started in 2024-25, compared to 7% without him, failing to win 13 of the 14 matches without their captain.
Given Spurs averaged 2.1 goals and 1.4 points per game with Son starting and only 1.0 goals and 0.4 points per game in his absence, Frank will need players to step up, including £55m summer signing Mohamed Kudus, who replaced him on Sunday.

Chelsea sign Ajax defender Hato for £37m,Netherlands defender Jorrel Hato signs seven-year contract with Chelsea after completing £37m transfer from Ajax.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yl93qdew0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 17:06:18",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have completed a £37m deal to sign Ajax defender Jorrel Hato.
The 19-year-old has finalised a seven-year contract with the Blues after a medical in London over the weekend.
The Netherlands international has become the eighth signing of the summer transfer window for the Fifa Club World Cup champions.
""I'm very excited, I'm so happy to be here,"" said Hato.
""I thought a lot about my future and wanted to take the next step in my career. Chelsea is the best place for me to do that so I'm very happy.""
Hato emerged from Ajax's famed academy, making his debut in the first team aged 16.
Adept at left-back or centre-back, he captained the Dutch club at 17 and went on to make 111 appearances.
Hato made his international debut for the Netherlands in 2023 against Gibraltar and has six caps.
'Hato signing makes sense in Chelsea's bloated squad'
The Blues boast seven centre-backs in their current squad, but only Levi Colwill, who played regularly last season, and Benoit Badiashile are naturally left-sided.
Frenchman Badiashile's 2024-25 campaign was disrupted by a hamstring injury in December, while just three Premier League starts suggested head coach Enzo Maresca wanted another option to compete with Colwill at the heart of defence.
Hato brings versatility, having spent large parts of last season at Ajax playing at left-back and, with Ben Chilwell firmly out of favour, the 19-year-old can also offer competition to regular full-back Marc Cucurella given the Champions League campaign to come.
In 2023-24, Hato played 80% of his football at centre-back, most commonly in a 4-2-3-1 formation. However, last season, new head coach Francesco Farioli deployed him at left-back for 94% of his minutes as part of a 4-3-3 formation.
Hato has already played 111 competitive games for Ajax's first team, after making his debut aged just 16 years and 335 days in 2023. That made him the club's third youngest player to feature in Eredivisie after Clarence Seedorf and Ryan Gravenberch. He also won his first Netherlands cap less than a year later.
Since that first appearance, Hato has been nearly ever-present for Ajax. Of players from Europe's top six leagues born after 1 January 2003, he has played the most minutes at club level in all competitions since the start of 2023-24 (8,347), clear of Jude Bellingham (7,988) and Lamine Yamal (7,506).
Who have Blues brought in this summer?
Hato is Chelsea's eighth addition to the squad this summer, with their spending so far reaching a combined sum of more than £250m.
Jamie Gittens - £48m from Borussia Dortmund. The England youth international arrives from the Bundesliga with a growing reputation as a direct, pacy winger capable of unlocking defences.
Joao Pedro - £55m from Brighton. Chelsea moved swiftly to secure the Brazilian forward, who impressed in the Premier League with his creativity, link-up play and finishing.
Liam Delap - £30m from Ipswich Town. A powerful striker with Premier League experience, Delap adds a different profile to Chelsea's attacking options.
Mamadou Sarr - £12m from Lyon. The 19-year-old centre-back joins as one for the future, bringing strength and composure in defence after progressing through Lyon's academy.
Dario Essugo - £18m from Sporting CP. A highly rated Portuguese midfielder, Essugo is known for his tenacity and maturity, having debuted in Liga Portugal at 16.
Estevao Willian - the Brazil winger joined the Blues from Palmeiras this summer in a £29m deal that was agreed in May 2024.
Kendry Paez - a £17m deal to sign the Ecuadorian teenager was agreed in 2023, but he has linked up with Chelsea this summer after turning 18 in May.

The former Leicester City playmaker, 28, pulled up off the ball seven minutes from time during Spurs' 1-1 draw with the Magpies.
The England international looked in clear discomfort and had to be taken from the field of play on a stretcher, while team-mate Son Heung-min, during his final appearance for the club, was visibly emotional watching on.
Frank says Maddison, who missed the Europa League final victory against Manchester United last season with a knee injury, has likely injured the same knee.

Son poised to join LAFC for potential record fee,Tottenham forward Son Heung-min is expected to join Los Angeles FC for around £20m after announcing his departure from Spurs.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0j9gqp09lyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 07:09:17",Nizaar Kinsella,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Son Heung-min is expected to join Los Angeles FC for around £20m after announcing his departure from Tottenham over the weekend.
The forward revealed in a news conference on Saturday that he will leave Tottenham this summer after 10 years at the club.
And the 33-year-old appears poised to join Major League Soccer (MLS) in what could even be a record fee, potentially surpassing the £22.5m paid by Atlanta United to sign Emmanuel Latte Lath from Middlesbrough in February.
The final details of the transfer remain in discussion but his move to LAFC is now considered subject just to the completion of paperwork and a medical.
Son, who is under contract with Spurs until 2026, made what is expected to be his final appearance for Tottenham in a 1-1 pre-season friendly against Newcastle in Seoul on Sunday.
He was embraced by his Spurs team-mates and the opposing Newcastle players, and they performed a guard of honour when he was substituted in the 65th minute. While Tottenham's pre-season preparations now take them to Germany to face Bayern Munich on Thursday - and a reunion with Harry Kane -Son is expected to enjoy some time in his native South Korea.
Arriving from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015, Son scored 173 goals in 454 appearances for Tottenham.
He was captain when Tottenham beat Manchester United in the Europa League final in May to clinch their first trophy in 17 years.

I went to games knowing we would struggle - Amorim,"Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim on last season's difficulties, his relationship with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his hopes for the new season.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz60p238e0eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 11:00:45",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim says he travelled to games last season fearful of what was going to happen to his team.
Speaking to reporters who are accompanying United on their pre-season tour of the United States, Amorim revealed for the first time the depth of his despair at presiding over United's worst season since the 1973-74 relegation campaign.
United finished 15th in the Premier League last season - their lowest league finish since the 1989-90 campaign.
Amorim, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag as manager in November 2024, oversaw a run of seven wins from 27 league games - and a shattering Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in Bilbao.
Asked how he felt when he returned home to meet his wife and young family after repeated defeats - at one point his side lost four games in a row and later on won only three times in 11 matches - Amorim said it was pre-match that was the most stressful.
""To tell you the truth, it's not how I returned to my house after the games, it was how I left to go to the games, because I felt that sometimes we will struggle,"" he said.
""All the struggles we had in games, I felt it before. That was the hardest part.
""To go to the games and know that we are not going to be competitive - I was really frustrated.""
But Amorim says he does not feel like that now. He says he has a less ""romantic"" view of his job but  also sees positives that make him ""believe"" better days are ahead.
In a 25-minute, wide-ranging interview at Chicago Fire's training ground, Amorim covered a range of topics, including:
How he is changing the culture at United
His relationship with minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe
His belief the club will eventually win the biggest trophies again
His dream of staying in the job for 20 years
During last season's dark days, Amorim was repeatedly criticised for refusing to tweak his tactical approach.
""Sometimes, when you are losing, you might think let's change the standards a little bit for them [the players] to be with me,"" he said.
""I didn't - and they saw it. Now they understand when I say something, I will do it.
""I don't treat the players as babies. But they have rules now and that can change the way you train.
""I'm always on top. If you don't train in the right way, I have footage to show you. And I show you in front of everybody.""
Amorim has appointed a leadership group of six players - Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Tom Heaton, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui - to uphold standards in the dressing room and deal with the ""small things"".
It has not been easy to get to this point.
Amorim admits there were times last season when he wavered and wondered if he had done the right thing leaving Portuguese club Sporting - where he had built his reputation and where he was feted as a hero - mid-season.
He did not go seeking out assurances. For Amorim, keeping his job says enough.
""Try to remember one team, one big team that lost so many games and the manager kept their job,"" he said.
""You will not find it. That shows more than words that they support me.""
Amorim on dealing with pressure
Amorim said last season that he was not worried about any pressure on his position, focusing instead on the team and what was needed to improve.
""This is not the moment I felt most pressure in my life. I had to finish my career as a player really quickly because of the injuries,"" he said.
""I remember me and my wife had an Excel spreadsheet with all the money that we have and all the things that I need. I want to help my family. I felt the pressure in that time.
""Nowadays, it's more like an ego thing. I want to be manager of Manchester United for a while.
""I took five years to choose this club. I don't want to fail.""
Asked how long he wants to stay at the club, Amorim replied: ""I want to stay 20 [years]. That is my goal. I truly believe in that.""
Amorim on blunt conversations with Ratcliffe
Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe told BBC Sport in March that Amorim was doing ""a super job"", describing him as ""an outstanding young manager"".
""We speak on the phone, he sends me messages, he sends me gifs - [I'm] joking,"" Amorim said.
""It's really easy to deal with Jim. If you know your stuff, how to explain any decision, you'll be fine.
""I know he's the owner of the club, I know my place. But when I need to say something, I'm really direct.
""I think it's something he likes a lot.""
Amorim on squad and ambition for season
The team will return to training at Carrington on Wednesday. The unwanted quartet of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia will continue to train at different times to the main squad.
""Garnacho is a really talented boy. But sometimes things don't work out,"" Amorim explained.
""You cannot explain specifically what it is. It's clear he wants a different thing with a different leadership.
""They want new challenges. The market is open. I'm just working with the players that I think are going to stay.""
The aim for the season is easy for Amorim.
""I know it's a massive gap from where we finished - but it's Manchester United. We need to return to Europe,"" he said.
And beyond that? Can United win the Premier League and Champions League again?
""I have no doubts,"" Amorim said.
""There are some things you cannot buy that this club has: pedigree, history, fans. We have money without the Champions League.
""With all these things, if we have a different culture, we can return to our place.""
How has pre-season gone so far?
It is very early but there are signs Amorim's approach is working.
On Wednesday, with a starting line-up retaining nine of the team that performed so poorly in Bilbao, United looked efficient, energised and, at times, exciting in a 4-1 win over Bournemouth.
Patrick Dorgu excelled in the left-sided wing-back role and Luke Shaw is fit and performing to a level that made him an automatic pick for England.
However, while there is more purpose and confidence around striker Rasmus Hojlund, it has emerged that United are willing to sell him for £30m.
Victory against Everton in Atlanta will send United home with a 100% record from their three games in the United States.
Amorim has support in the boardroom. He also has it in the Old Trafford stands. Fans continually sang his name and Amorim has promised them this season will be better.
""If I say it, it's because I believe it,"" he said. ""We cannot control the results. But the way we play, the way we perform, the way we connect with the fans, all these small things, we are going to do those no matter what.
""All the credit I had when I arrived was used last year. Now we have to perform.
""If I have the feeling before the game we are going to be competitive, then we'll be OK.
""I just don't want to return to that feeling that we are thinking it's not a 50-50 game.""

Premier League 2025-26 preview No 1: Arsenal,Mikel Arteta enters a pivotal season after finally buying a centre-forward and reinforcing his midfield and defence,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/04/premier-league-2025-26-preview-no-1-arsenal,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 23:01:54",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"Guardian writers’ predicted position: 2nd (NB: this is not necessarily Ed Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)
Last season’s position: 2nd
Prospects
Mikel Arteta vowed this would be a “big summer” after finishing as runners-up in the Premier League for a third season in succession and the new sporting director, Andrea Berta, has delivered on a number of signings in his first transfer window. The question now for Arsenal supporters is whether Martin Zubimendi, Christian Nørgaard, Noni Madueke, Viktor Gyökeres, Cristhian Mosquera and Kepa Arrizabalaga can help them take that elusive final step to becoming champions for the first time since the Invincibles in 2004.
The arrival of Gyökeres will certainly quieten the clamour for a new No 9 that has rumbled on for several years, although the pressure will immediately be on the Sweden striker to hit the ground running. Longstanding target Zubimendi should provide metronomic accuracy at the base of a new-look midfield that Arteta will hope can continue to get the best out of Declan Rice and rejuvenate the captain Martin Ødegaard, while Madueke will surely provide much better back-up for their talisman Bukayo Saka than Raheem Sterling managed last season and could also push Gabriel Martinelli for a starting place on the left flank.
But even with the teenage sensations Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri having committed their futures to the club after enjoying outstanding breakthrough seasons, there remain concerns about a lack of creativity in the squad. A move for Crystal Palace’s FA Cup hero Eberechi Eze could depend on players departing before the end of August to balance the books.
Yet while Arsenal may end up paying more than £200m for the additions to their squad so far, seeing champions Liverpool comfortably outspend them after finishing 10 points ahead last season has left many fans wondering if they have gone far enough. The squad definitely looks stronger than this time last year but with other rivals also closing in, it could be make or break for Arteta.
The manager
Ending yet another campaign without silverware was a bitter pill to swallow for Arteta, who celebrated his fifth anniversary in charge just before Christmas. A solitary FA Cup a few months later is not a fair reflection on the progress Arsenal have made since then – especially given the run to the Champions League semi-finals last season – but Arteta knows he will be ultimately judged on delivering titles. He made no secret of his frustration over the lack of cover in Arsenal’s squad as the injuries mounted up last year. With plenty of reinforcements now added, Arteta must seize his opportunity.
Off-field picture
The surprise departure of Edu Gaspar in November disrupted plans for the January transfer window but Berta has provided some fresh perspective since joining in March. Arsenal’s American owners, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, were rated as the most valuable sports ownership group on the planet in July at an estimated $21.3bn (£16.1bn) thanks to a portfolio that also includes the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams, the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche and the NBA’s Denver Nuggets. So funding another summer spending spree wasn’t an issue after keeping their powder relatively dry last year. They – like Arsenal’s supporters, who pay for one of the most expensive season tickets in the country – however, will want a return for their investment at some point.
Star signing
No Arsenal player managed 10 goals in the Premier League last season so the onus is on Gyökeres – who scored a staggering 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting – to fill the void. The only issue is that the 27-year-old never played in English football’s top flight despite being on Brighton’s books and then excelling in the Championship for Coventry. He will be expecting to get plenty of opportunities in a side that usually dominates their opponents in midfield but struggled to break teams down last season, drawing 14 times in the league. Having eventually opted for Gyökeres rather than RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko or Alexander Isak of Newcastle, Arsenal must now find a way to utilise his obvious strengths.
Stepping up
It is highly probable that only Premier League regulations prevented Max Dowman from taking Nwaneri’s record as the competition’s youngest ever player last season. The attacking midfielder has been training with Arsenal’s first team squad since celebrating his 15th birthday at the turn of the year and was described as “special” by Arteta after coming off the bench to win a penalty in their pre-season win against Newcastle in Singapore. “What he’s done against this team in the time that he had on the pitch is something certainly not common to witness for a 15-year-old,” he said. Dowman is expected to be handed an opportunity sooner rather than later and it will be intriguing to see what impact he can have.
A big season for …
Martin Ødegaard was the first to admit that his performances last season lacked their usual sparkle, with a return of three league goals his lowest since moving to north London permanently in 2021. The 26-year-old captain was also substituted on 12 occasions after missing part of the season due to an ankle injury as he struggled to find his best form. The Norwegian must rekindle his relationship with Saka that has proved so effective down the years, while Arteta will be hoping that Gyökeres can finish off some of the chances Ødegaard will inevitably create given the lack of other options besides the inexperienced Nwaneri and Dowman.

Bruno Fernandes criticises ‘lazy’ Manchester United and calls for more signings,Captain unhappy with display in 2-2 Everton draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/04/bruno-fernandes-criticises-lazy-manchester-united-and-calls-for-more-signings,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 07:19:03",Guardian sport,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United’s captain, Bruno Fernandes, let rip at his teammates after their 2-2 pre-season draw with Everton, saying their performance was “lazy” and calling for further reinforcements.
A second-half goal from Mason Mount had United on course for victory in Atlanta, Georgia, after Fernandes’s opener was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, but a bizarre 75th-minute own goal by Ayden Heaven gifted Everton the draw.
The result put a slight damper on United’s tour of the US, after promising victories over West Ham United and Bournemouth.
“It’s been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too,” Fernandes told NBC Sports. “We didn’t want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn’t the best and we were a little bit lazy today. We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.”
United had their worst Premier League campaign last season, finishing 15th, and have signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo – both of whom started against Everton.
“It’s improving,” Fernandes said. “But it’s not the place it needs to be. I don’t want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.
“But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do. Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.”
Asked about Fernandes’s comments, Ruben Amorim said: “I think I’m happy for the players to have that feeling. It’s saying that they understand the situation. So, it’s a good feeling.
“I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season. We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].”
The manager said during the US tour that he hoped to be with the club for two decades. “I want to stay 20 [years]. That is my goal. I truly believe in that.”
Amorim said he had a positive relationship with the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who heads the football operation. “It’s really easy to deal with Jim. If you know your stuff, how to explain any decision, you’ll be fine. I know he’s the owner of the club, I know my place. But when I need to say something, I’m really direct.

Football transfer rumours: Spurs to replace Son with Rodrygo? Núňez set for Al-Hilal?,Today’s rumours are heavily invested,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/04/football-transfer-rumours-tottenham-son-heung-min-rodrygo-darwin-nunez-al-hilal,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 07:00:04",Will Unwin,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"There is a sense that the transfer window is entering a period of calm before the inevitable storm. The chitter-chatter of agents is at a lull and the same old names are being bandied around in the hope someone will finally have a nibble.
Tottenham’s Son Heung-min is on his way out and therefore a replacement needs to be found by Thomas Frank. At this stage of August, it is sensible to target someone who is definitely available. Real Madrid’s Rodrygo will be allowed to leave the Spanish capital and moving to the British equivalent may be a reasonable selling point to the Brazilian, not to mention the joys of testing himself in the Premier League rather than sitting on a number of La Liga benches.
If Liverpool are to get the money together to bring in Alexander Isak, it would be quite helpful if they could off-load Darwin Núñez. Do not fear, because there is often a Saudi Premier League side willing to help out clubs in such a plight and Al-Hilal are open to offering a massive wad of cash in exchange for the Uruguayan striker.
It is well documented that Manchester United and Newcastle want to acquire the lanky services of Benjamin Sesko from Leipzig, but the Magpies are busily concocting a plan B, just in case the Slovenian fancies keeping his midweeks free. If Sesko heads to Old Trafford, Eddie Howe will get on the blower to Paris Saint-Germain as he is keen on Gonçalo Ramos. The Portuguese striker has rarely been Luis Enrique’s first choice, so could be happy to head to another Champions League team in the hope of becoming a star.
One former Manchester United forward could be on the move in the coming weeks, as Inter have taken an interest in Mason Greenwood. The former England international has impressed in Ligue 1 with Marseille, and any potential sale would be welcomed at Old Trafford as they get a healthy whack of sell-on percentage. Whether Inter push forward with a move for Greenwood, might depend on another English-born winger after Ademola Lookman handed in a transfer request at Atalanta. The Nigerian international has been a target at San Siro for a while and Lookman looks eager to push through a move.
Chelsea remain keen on the Leipzig midfielder Xavi Simons but there could be a twist in the tale as the Germans may counter this by bidding for Tyrique George. The teenager has shown promise since breaking into the first team at Stamford Bridge, but very few people are off limits at Chelsea as they just love to do deals.
And across London, Arsenal have made an inquiry with Rennes over the 20-year-old defender Jérémy Jacquet. The French centre-back is deemed to be not for sale by the Ligue 1 side, which might be somewhat problematic for the Gunners, but money often talks.

James Maddison knee injury mars Son Heung-min’s Spurs send-off in Seoul,Midfielder carried off on a stretcher in Newcastle friendly,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/03/james-maddison-injury-son-heung-min-tottenham,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 22:07:13",Tottenham Hotspur,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"James Maddison sustained a serious looking knee injury as Tottenham’s pre-season tour of Asia concluded with a draw against Newcastle in Seoul on Sunday. The England international was carried off on a stretcher and appeared to be in obvious pain after going down unchallenged late in the game.
Maddison, 28, missed the closing stages of last season, including the Europa League final, with a knee problem and his latest injury affects the same joint. The Spurs head coach, Thomas Frank, said: “I think sometimes in life and football things can be both beautiful and brutal – that’s what we got today. It looks like with Madders a bad injury, and then on the other side unbelievable scenes for Son from his teammates and the respect from the Newcastle players.”
The friendly, which ended 1-1, was otherwise notable for the emotional reception the departing Son Heung-min received from fans in his home city. Son, 33, confirmed this week that he is to leave Spurs this summer after a decade at the club. The South Korea international, who wore the captain’s armband, was given a standing ovation and a guard of honour from players of both teams when he was substituted in the 64th minute.
Son, who scored 173 goals in 454 competitive appearances for the club, said the occasion was an emotional one. The forward also thanked Frank for his understanding having told him he wishes to seek a fresh challenge. Son told the club’s website: “It was a perfect moment. Sharing these beautiful moments are something that I will never forget and I will always appreciate it – from the fans, the players and the gaffer.
“He understood my situation and was always on my side. He always listened to me and asked what I wanted to do. I have a huge respect and am very grateful.” Reflecting on his time in north London, he said: “I wish them all the best. There are five competitions ahead and I hope they win all the five competitions. That’s my wish.
“Spurs will always be in my heart and the boys will always be in my history books. It was incredible. They’ve gone so fast, the 10 years. I can only think about the beautiful moments, amazing moments.”
Tottenham later announced the signing of the Portugal midfielder João Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich. The 30-year-old’s move is subject to international clearance and obtaining a work permit, with Spurs holding an option to make it a permanent transfer next summer.
Palhinha returns to the Premier League having spent two seasons at Fulham before joining Bayern in July 2024, going on to win the Bundesliga title last season and then helping Portugal to Nations League success.
“When I knew of the interest from Tottenham, I didn’t need to think about it too much. I just wanted to come (here),” Palhinha told Spursplay. “The coach (Frank) is probably the main thing which had more of an impact on my decision – when you feel that someone wants you, it means a lot and you are closer to making an easy decision.
“I will try to help to show again what I am capable to do it. Now my home is here [in London] and I will try to enjoy these moments with my family.”
