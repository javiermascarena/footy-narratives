Aston Villa interested in signing Chelsea striker Jackson,Aston Villa are interested in signing Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415336/nicolas-jackson-transfer-news-aston-villa-interested-in-signing-chelsea-striker-after-exploring-conditions-of-deal,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 18:00:00",,['Chelsea'],"Aston Villa are interested in signing Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson.
Villa are understood to have explored the conditions of a deal for the 24-year-old, who played under head coach Unai Emery at Villarreal.
Jackson told Chelsea earlier this month that he wants to consider his options during the transfer window. Chelsea signed strikers Joao Pedro and Liam Delap this summer.
Jackson was absent from Chelsea's squad for friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan ahead of the Premier League season.
The striker served the final game of a suspension in Chelsea's first fixture of the season against Crystal Palace.
Jackson scored 13 goals in 37 appearances across all competitions last season, having netted 17 in 44 during his first year at the club.
Chelsea have sold a host of players this summer, with another nine likely to leave, while Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons top targets to bolster their attacking line.
Latest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:
Jackson's future will be resolved when it becomes clear whether Alexander Isak is staying at or leaving Newcastle United.
There are up to six clubs interested in signing Jackson and Chelsea are expecting significant bids when there is more clarity about Isak's future.
Aston Villa are one of the interested clubs, but it remains to be seen whether they would be able to afford the asking price.
Jackson's value will be determined by the market price paid for strikers by Premier League clubs this summer.
Latest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:
Chelsea are close to agreeing a deal to sell Renato Veiga to Villarreal in a deal expected to be worth £26m (€30m).
The defender joined Chelsea last summer from Basel for £12m on a contract until June 2031.
He scored two goals in 18 appearances before spending the second half of last season on loan at Juventus, where he played 15 times.
Veiga was also called up to the Portugal squad after signing for Chelsea and has earned five caps.
Latest from Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:
Fulham are considering making a move to sign Raheem Sterling from Chelsea, but a deal appears unlikely at the moment.
Sterling is expected to leave Chelsea this summer after spending last season on loan at Arsenal.
He has been training away from the first-team squad and did not travel to the United States for the Club World Cup.
Chelsea signed him from Manchester City three years ago in a £47.5m deal and he has two years left on his contract.
Sterling has not played for Chelsea since he scored against Bournemouth in the final game of the 2023/24 season.

Arsenal's Havertz being assessed over knee injury,Kai Havertz is currently being assessed over a knee injury,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13415182/kai-havertz-injury-arsenal-forward-being-assessed-over-knee-problem,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 12:11:00",Sam Blitz,['Arsenal'],"Kai Havertz is currently being assessed over a knee injury
The German was absent from Arsenal's open training session put on for the fans at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.
Havertz has only just returned from a long-term hamstring injury which kept him out between February and May.
The club are assessing the situation and are waiting for the injury to settle before further analysis.
Just days ago, the topic of debate was which striker out of Havertz or Viktor Gyokeres should start in Arsenal's big game against Liverpool next week. ""I think Mikel Arteta will go back to Havertz in the big games,"" said Jamie Carragher. ""I would be very surprised if Havertz doesn't play.""
Now it seems that the decision has been taken out of Arteta's hands.
No matter the severity of this Havertz knee injury, the German will be a major doubt for the trip to Anfield - placing a huge focus on Gyokeres in the first big game of his Arsenal career.
But once again, Arsenal are talking about injuries after it derailed them last season. Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka all missed over a dozen league matches due to injury last term - only the latter is fully fit at the start of this one.
Arsenal do know that Mikel Merino can fill in as an emergency option but that was an awkward scenario last season which Arteta and the Arsenal team made the most of. Playing the Spaniard as a No 9 again is a situation they want to avoid, if possible.
What this situation does tell us, though, is that Arsenal will have to get Gyokeres on song soon, after a slightly underwhelming Premier League debut at Manchester United last weekend.
Saturday's game against Leeds - which Gyokeres will almost certainly start now - is important in the early context of Arsenal's season. Goals are needed.

Arsenal's ruthless Eze coup shows intent - leaving Spurs stunned,"Arsenal's stunning coup to snatch Eberechi Eze away from Spurs is a ruthless statement of intent, says BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93de7x257xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 21:59:02",Phil McNulty,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Arsenal's dramatic move to steal Eberechi Eze away from arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur is a ruthless statement of intent designed to show this is the season they can finally claim the biggest prizes.
Spurs were ready to roll out the welcoming carpet for Crystal Palace's England forward on Wednesday, with every indication a deal for the 27-year-old was virtually done.
It then filtered out that Arsenal were assessing the seriousness of a knee injury to forward Kai Havertz, which could potentially put a dent in their attacking resources - a weakness that played a significant part in manager Mikel Arteta's side finishing empty-handed for the fifth year in succession last season.
Instead of taking the cheaper option of exploring the loan market, as was first expected, Arsenal went for broke in spectacular style by setting up a £60m coup to take Eze to Emirates Stadium.
Eze's move to Arsenal is not simply a devastating psychological blow aimed across north London at Spurs.
It is a clear signal the Gunners have no intention of falling short in their stated aim of mounting a serious Premier League title challenge, as well as going deep in the Champions League once more after reaching the semi-finals last season.
It is a strategy in stark contrast to the inertia that gripped Arsenal last season, when their failure to solve an obvious problem - by signing a recognised striker - cost them dearly.
Spurs thought they had Eze wrapped up, with the possibility of a cash-plus-Richarlison deal discussed, but Arsenal moved with lightning speed once they were confronted by the possibility of Havertz facing a spell on the sidelines.
Arsenal have been linked with Eze all summer, but it was thought their interest had cooled once Ethan Nwaneri agreed a new five-year contract, on top of signing Chelsea winger Noni Madueke in a £48.5m deal.
Havertz's injury, and its potential consequences, reignited that interest to leave Spurs stunned.
Arteta knows this is the season he must land a major prize, and to do so he has been heavily backed by Arsenal's hierarchy.
As well as Madueke, the Gunners have concluded moves to sign Spain's outstanding midfielder Martin Zubimendi in a deal worth up to £60m and, at least 12 months too late, a recognised striker in Viktor Gyokeres, from Sporting for £64m.
In Eze, who had two years left on his Palace contract, Arsenal will get a versatile forward rich in natural talent who is a match-winner - as he proved when scoring the winner against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final.
This was a follow-up to the spectacular right-foot finish that set Palace on their way to a 3-0 win over Aston Villa at Wembley in the semi-final. Eze also scored the Eagles' opener when they beat Fulham 3-0 at Craven Cottage in the quarter-final.
Eze has demonstrated he has the temperament and talent for the big occasion when inspiring Palace to the first major trophy in their history.
Arsenal will hope he has plenty of those occasions ahead.
He is a scorer and creator who will add real threat to Arsenal's front line, with 14 goals and 11 assists in all competitions last season.
Eze was a boyhood Arsenal fan and was part of the club's academy until he was 13. He may have been initially keen on a move to Spurs, but once the Gunners showed their hand there was only one part of north London he was heading to.
He has achieved his goals the hard way, spending time at Fulham, Reading and Millwall before signing for Queens Park Rangers. He left Loftus Road for Palace in a £19.5m deal in August 2020.
Spurs believe they did all they could to conclude a deal - apart from actually concluding it - but it is a hammer blow to chairman Daniel Levy and manager Thomas Frank, who also thought they had a deal for Morgan Gibbs-White in the bag only for him to sign a new contract at Nottingham Forest.
Arsenal will revel in the local rivalry of snatching away one of Tottenham's prime targets, but the wider context demonstrates the Gunners are deadly serious about ending a wait for success that now stretches back to 2020.
Eze has previously admitted to ""crying for a week"" when he was let go by Arsenal in 2011, but the gifted forward has now been given a golden opportunity to make up for lost time.

Arsenal move ahead of Spurs in race for £60m Eze,"Arsenal launch a move for Crystal Palace attacker Eberechi Eze, who is expected to choose them ahead of Tottenham.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czerxg66w8lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:56:15",Sami Mokbel,"['Arsenal', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Eberechi Eze is expected to join Arsenal for £60m after the Gunners reached an agreement in principle to sign the forward from Crystal Palace.
Sources have told BBC Sport that Eze favours a move to Arsenal, with whom he started his youth career, despite north London rivals Tottenham having been in talks to sign him.
A deal for Spurs to sign Eze had been agreed between the clubs earlier on Wednesday after talks lasting 10 days, sources said, but it was not finalised.
Arsenal's offer also includes £8m in add-ons.
The Gunners have concerns over a knee injury sustained by attacker Kai Havertz and Eze, 27, would offer Mikel Arteta a fresh option in advanced areas.
Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner said on Wednesday that Eze would start in Thursday's Uefa Conference League play-off tie against Fredrikstad, along with Liverpool-linked Marc Guehi, as they remain ""committed to the team"".
Sources have told BBC Sport that Eze wants to join Arsenal before the transfer window closes on 1 September.
Eze had a goal ruled out when Palace began their Premier League campaign with a draw at Chelsea on Sunday.
The England international has an expired release clause in his contract which was worth an initial £60m, plus a further £8m in add-ons.
Palace benefited hugely from Eze's 14 goals across all competitions last season, which included a strike in their 1-0 FA Cup final win against Manchester City.
Eze joined the Eagles from Queens Park Rangers for £19.5m in 2020 and his current deal runs until the summer of 2027.
One of the moments of the transfer window for Arsenal
If Arsenal beat their rivals Tottenham to complete the signing of Eze, there is little doubt it would be one of the standout moments of the transfer window.
It's certainly a moment their fans will revel in.
Spurs would have thought they had their man almost signed and sealed, but things can change quickly in football.
Arsenal had been actively looking at options in the market and have been monitoring Eze for a long time.
With Ethan Nwaneri signing a new deal and the signing of Noni Madueke adding to the options provided by Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard, signing another forward was not a pressing need.
However, Kai Havertz's knee injury has changed things, and although the Gunners do not yet know how long the German faces out of action, a reinforcement was needed.
A blow for Spurs
For Tottenham, news that Eze is on the brink of joining Arsenal will be a major blow.
New boss Thomas Frank had targeted Eze after losing James Maddison to injury and the club had been confident of completing a deal.
Club insiders at Tottenham insist there is nothing more they could have done to sign Eze, and the fact that he was a boyhood Arsenal fan who was in the club's academy until he was 13 meant that once the Gunners came in for him there was only one place he would end up.

Chelsea sales reach £250m as Veiga fee is agreed,Renato Veiga is set to leave Stamford Bridge with Chelsea on way to earn £250m from selling players this summer.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62n5r3g9e9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 18:38:41",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea have agreed to sell defender Renato Veiga to Villarreal for a fee rising to £26m - taking total player sales to over £250m for the Blues this summer.
Veiga, 22, is expected to sign a seven-year contract and complete a medical in Spain on Thursday after the Spanish club agreed to pay close to their transfer record.
The Portugal international was deemed surplus to requirements by manager Enzo Maresca and was training in the so-called 'bomb squad' - a group of senior players away from the first team - having asked to play at centre-back instead of left-back midway through last season.
Chelsea will make a substantial profit on Veiga, who played 18 times for the club after joining from FC Basel in 2024 for £12m.
Veiga spent part of the season on loan at Juventus, while Atletico Madrid showed an interest earlier in the transfer window.
The move will see Chelsea raise an estimated £251.7m from selling 11 players, to balance £277m of spending on nine new players in a busy summer of transfers.
The biggest sales have been Noni Madueke's move to Arsenal for an initial £48m, Joao Felix's deal with Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr for a fee rising to £43.7m and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall joining Everton in a £28m deal.
Chelsea remain interested in adding Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig midfielder Xavi Simons before the transfer window closes on 1 September.
They are also trying to sell additional players, including Nicolas Jackson, Christopher Nkunku, Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi.

The 21-year-old is expected to finalise terms over a contract in the coming days with Brighton including a sell-on clause in the deal.
Strasbourg are linked to Chelsea through their BlueCo ownership, led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, with the move for the Paraguay international potentially the most significant since the £65.2m takeover in 2023.
There are significant connections between Chelsea and Strasbourg, who are managed by Englishman Liam Rosenior, with goalkeeper Mike Penders, Kendry Paez and Mamadou Sarr all on loan from Stamford Bridge.
Strasbourg have also signed multiple players from Chelsea, including Ishe Samuels-Smith, Mathis Amougou and Diego Moreira in the last two seasons, while there is a host of ex-Premier League talent at the club from former Brighton defender Valentin Barco and former Southampton forward Sekou Mara.
The Alsace club qualified for the Conference League last season through a seventh-placed finish.

Eze & Guehi to play in Europe for Crystal Palace,"Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze, who are wanted by Liverpool and Tottenham respectively, will feature for Crystal Palace in Europe on Thursday.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c939j0jwexzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 14:31:28",,"['Liverpool', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner says Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi will start the Uefa Conference League play-off tie against Fredrikstad as they remain ""committed to the team"".
Liverpool and Palace have held talks about a possible £35m deal for England defender Guehi, 25, to go to Anfield before the transfer deadline.
Meanwhile, Tottenham and Arsenal want to sign Palace's England forward Eze, 27, before the 1 September transfer deadline.
Both players started the 0-0 draw at Chelsea last Sunday and will feature again when Norwegian side Fredrikstad visit Selhurst Park on Thursday (20:00 BST).
""Many of you were surprised he [Eze] and Marc [Guehi] started against Chelsea, you may be surprised they start tomorrow, but they are committed to the team,"" said Glasner on Wednesday.
""They will play a crucial part for as long as they are here, they are committed to the team.
""If they leave, they want to leave as the guys who gave 100% to Crystal Palace.""
'Trust the manager'
Eze and Guehi were key as Palace won the FA Cup last season, the first major honour in the club's history.
Their departures would be a blow but goalkeeper Dean Henderson is confident that the team can kick-on and have a successful season if they both leave.
""We have lost players in the past and we survived through that,"" said Henderson.
""And we brought the best times to this football club.
""Even when we lost Michael [Olise], we followed it up with the best-ever season in 119 years of the club.
""You have got to trust the manager and the process, and we will be very fine.""
'We will enjoy Europe'
Glasner said that Palace are determined to ""enjoy"" playing in the Conference League after losing their appeal against being demoted from the Europa League.
The Eagles qualified for the Europa League after winning the FA Cup last season but were punished by Uefa for breaching multi-club ownership rules.
""This is the last time I will respond to this question,"" added Glasner at his pre-match news conference.
""We shouldn't talk about it any more, we can't change it.
""We deserve to play Europa League, we are the FA Cup champions. But, it was decided we would be demoted, so we will prepare.
""It is the first time European football will be played at Selhust, this is our reward for winning the FA Cup and we will enjoy it.
""Many fans did not expect us to play European football, so this is our approach.""
Fredrikstad are currently eighth in Norway's top-flight.

Williams 'learned from mistakes' as ex-Man Utd player rebuilds at Hull,"Brandon Williams, who was sentenced to 14 months for dangerous driving, is ready to focus on his football career again.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2k12dd7rlo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 17:22:51",,['Manchester United'],"Brandon Williams says he has learned from past mistakes as he refocuses on his football career.
Williams is now at Hull City to begin a new chapter, having signed on a one-year contract.
He was out of the game for 20 months, a period in which he was sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for two years, having been convicted for dangerous driving.
It was a dark chapter for the former Manchester United full-back, but he now wants to look forward.
""It was in the moment I was in, I wasn't in a good place,"" the 24-year-old told BBC Radio Humberside.
""It's a big regret and I've learned from my mistakes. I was still a young boy and I'm grown up now. My focus is back on football and that's all I want to do now.""
Williams played 51 games for United after coming through the ranks at Old Trafford.
More than two thirds of those appearances came in his debut season as a teenager under the then manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and it looked like he was destined for a glittering career.
He was arrested for dangerous driving in August 2023, before he was eventually released by United last summer and took a complete break from football.
""I just fell out of love with football,"" he said. ""Things were going on off the pitch, I had a lot going on and I just couldn't focus on my football.
""It just got to the stage where it was too much for me to carry on and it was better for me to take a step away and a step back and try and find myself again.""
Stepping away from football in the prime of a career is not an easy thing to do, but Williams reflects on it as the right thing for him.
It allowed him a chance to work away from the public glare and now, thanks to successfully coming through a trial period with Hull, he can start to rebuild.
""I took action to step away from the game but I feel like I managed it well,"" he said.
""I was working in silence. Everyone was questioning what I was doing but I was working the whole time.
""I was keeping fit and making sure I was ready to step back into football. It was always the aim.
""Just before pre-season I felt ready to step back into football and it was important that I did get the training and friendlies in.
""Now it's just building and building, I'm still not 100% but I'm sure in the next weeks and months I'll be there.""
Williams was an unused substitute in the Tigers' win over Oxford United in the Championship on Sunday.
He featured in a couple of pre-season games, but he is eagerly awaiting a competitive return to action for the first time since December 2023.
However, that involvement in the squad did give him the feeling that he has missed while being away from the game.
""It's the nerves and butterflies before the game that I've missed,"" he said.
""I'm not a very patient person, so I was excited to get on the pitch, but I'm sure that'll come soon. Now it's down to me to impress the manager.""

Why 'Chelsea's trophy' is in the US president's office,Why is a Club World Cup trophy in US President Donald Trump's Oval Office in Washington? BBC Sport takes a look.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp3e20kk0l2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 10:54:28",Jess Anderson,['Chelsea'],"When the White House posted a picture of US President Donald Trump meeting with world leaders in the Oval Office at the White House this week, eagle-eyed football fans spotted an unlikely piece of silverware in pride of place.
The Club World Cup trophy, which Chelsea beat Paris St-Germain to win in July in New Jersey, can be seen on display, external in the president's office in Washington DC.
The image led many on social media to question why 'Chelsea's trophy' resides in one of the most important offices in the world weeks after Enzo Maresca's side lifted it at Metlife Stadium.
Following the final in July, President Trump said he was told he could keep the trophy in recognition of the United States hosting the month-long tournament.
""I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] 'We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one',"" he said in an interview with DAZN.
""And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.""
But, according to Fifa, that is not quite the case. There are in fact three Club World Cup trophies in existence.
The original engraved version is in Zurich, Switzerland, at Fifa's headquarters, as is the custom with all Fifa trophies - including the World Cup.
One replica belongs to Chelsea and the holders paraded it during a pre-season friendly against AC Milan.
It is the third version that lives in the Oval Office in ""recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts"", Fifa told BBC Sport.
The Club World Cup, which was held across 11 cities in the US, was called the ""world's most successful club competition"" by organisers.
But it also came under criticism for its low attendances - there were more than a million empty seats during the tournament - and for the weather conditions and quality of the pitches in the US.
In an unusual incident, Trump presented Chelsea with the trophy but remained on stage after the presentation and celebrated with the players, who said they were ""a bit confused"".
Following the Blues' triumph, Trump presented the trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James before being invited to move aside by Fifa president Gianni Infantino.
But Trump remained alongside James and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, and applauded as James lifted the trophy, staying in position for a few seconds before he and Infantino left at the rear of the stage.
The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will jointly host the 2026 men's World Cup next summer.

Tottenham stunned as Arsenal swoop in to agree £67.5m Eberechi Eze deal,Arsenal approach Crystal Palace after Havertz injury,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/20/arsenal-could-attempt-to-sign-striker-after-kai-havertz-picks-up-knee-injury,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 21:11:21",Ed Aarons,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Arsenal have agreed a deal worth up to £67.5m for Eberechi Eze and look poised to sensationally hijack Tottenham’s move for the England forward.
It is understood that Mikel Arteta’s side made an approach to Crystal Palace over Eze after Kai Havertz sustained a knee injury during Arsenal’s win against Manchester United on Sunday. Arsenal are continuing to assess the injury but fear that the German forward could be absent for an extended period, even if the early indications are that it is not extremely serious.
But the uncertainty prompted Arsenal to accelerate their interest in Eze, with sources indicating that they have remained in constant contact with the 27‑year‑old’s representatives all summer.
Tottenham had looked in pole position to sign him after stepping up their interest over the weekend and are believed to have agreed a deal worth close to his release clause of £68m, which expired last week.
Yet with Arteta keen to add to his attacking reinforcements as they attempt to become champions for the first time since 2004, it is understood that the sporting director, Andrea Berta, and vice-chairman, Tim Lewis, contacted Palace on Wednesday to gazump their north London rivals.
Eze, who has made no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level by playing for a club in the Champions League, has indicated he would prefer to join the club that released him at the age of 13 rather than their north London rivals.
Arsenal are believed to have agreed a deal with the Palace chair, Steve Parish, in which they will pay a large chunk of the initial £60m fee up front, with another £7.5m in bonuses. QPR, from whom Palace signed him in 2020 for £19.5m, are due a 15% sell-on fee of any profit they make. Personal terms are not expected to be an issue.
It is understood that Eze will play for Palace in the first leg of Crystal Palace’s Conference League playoff on Thursday and have an opportunity to bid farewell to the supporters after scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup final in May. He is then expected to complete his medical and become Arsenal’s seventh summer signing.
Oliver Glasner, the Palace manager, praised Eze’s attitude as speculation has mounted over his future, with doubts over whether he would feature against Chelsea in their opening Premier League game when he had a free‑kick disallowed by the video assistant referee. “I’m still disappointed that this goal was disallowed and he will show a great performance tomorrow,” Glasner said.
Havertz, who played 31 minutes as a substitute at Old Trafford on Sunday, did not take part in an open training session at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday morning. His absence would leave Arteta with the new signing Viktor Gyökeres as the only available recognised striker in his squad, with Gabriel Jesus not expected to return from a knee injury in the near future. Mikel Merino filled in when Havertz missed 18 matches last season after sustaining a hamstring injury in February, and the Spain midfielder scored seven goals from then until May. Arteta expressed his desire that Havertz could play alongside Gyökeres in pre-season.
“Kai can play in different positions, as well,” he said. “I think it elevates the quality in the squad, the goal threat that we have in the team, the options that we have to change and provide oppositions with a lot of problems.”
Arsenal have already spent almost £200m this summer and are still hoping to move on a number of fringe players before the end of the transfer window. Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko both have interest from Porto, with Italian clubs having also been linked to the Poland defender.
Kiwior is understood to prefer to move overseas despite interest from other Premier League clubs after he deputised for the injured Gabriel Magalhães last season. Arsenal are in talks with Stuttgart over a move for Fábio Vieira, while Reiss Nelson could rejoin Fulham after spending last season on loan in west London. Eze’s potential arrival could also mean they step up attempts to sell Leandro Trossard.

"Crystal Palace, take heart: Conference League offers story of English success","While Oliver Glasner’s side have a clear shot at glory, the health of the competition as a whole is up for debate",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/20/crystal-palace-take-heart-conference-league-offers-story-of-english-success,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 18:00:46",Nick Ames,['Chelsea'],"It is hard to imagine Uefa will be spared the wrath of Selhurst Park when Crystal Palace begin Conference League life there on Thursday night. A red-letter event in the club’s history has been soured by their demotion from the Europa League and the sight of Norway’s cup winners, Fredrikstad, mid-table in the Eliteserien, lining up against Oliver Glasner’s players will hardly lend itself to a sense of glamour.
For all the burning sense of injustice, there is a clear upside for Palace. They will probably never have a better chance of European success if history and raw numbers are measures to go by. Any Premier League club should start as hot favourites to win the continent’s third-tier competition, such is their financial advantage over all of the contenders. That status has been justified in two of its four editions and there is inspiration to be taken from the scenes of joy when West Ham and Chelsea took the trophy home.
There is also a warning sign for the tournament itself. The Conference League was intended to provide smaller and medium-sized nations with a larger and longer dose of European football, notionally offering some of them a shot at going the distance. So the bigger picture did not look especially edifying when West Ham, who had finished 14th in the Premier League, beat Fiorentina in the 2023 final. The alarm bells rang even louder when Chelsea, at best deigning to field second-string sides for most of the competition, strolled to glory with a goal difference of 45-12.
Is the future really a carve-up between English clubs and, if so, to what extent does that matter? During discussions about the Conference League’s creation in the second half of the last decade, there was serious debate about whether teams from the “big five” countries would be invited to participate at all. It was eventually decided that excluding them would, as well as reducing the event’s sporting merit, mean turning down an obvious opportunity. For many minnows, the attention gained by drawing a giant might be genuinely transformative.
That would certainly be the case if the San Marino champions AC Virtus, an improbable presence in the playoff round, somehow defeat the Icelanders Breidablik and reach the league phase. It is partly why there were few tears at Djurgården, the eight-time Allsvenskan winners but hitherto a peripheral presence in Europe, when they were beaten 5-1 on aggregate by Chelsea in last season’s semi-finals. Getting that far and being able to host one of Europe’s celebrated names constituted a historic progression into new territory, however the result turned out. Their travelling fans had little problem enjoying a virtually dead second leg at Stamford Bridge.
Insiders at Uefa and the increasingly powerful European Club Association have little patience with any idea that the Conference League is flawed, either in concept or execution. They can point out that 29 different countries were represented in last season’s league phase, which stands in wild contrast to the 16 whose sides competed in the Champions League and 22 in the Europa League. All representatives will receive a baseline £2.7m sum and the feedback has been that clubs are content. It is a rich cross-section of interests and cultures.
The victories by Roma and Olympiakos, in 2022 and 2024 respectively, add weight to the argument that anyone bemoaning English dominance is jumping the gun. A longer-term view must be taken before discerning whether the Conference League suffers the same problems that ultimately dogged the Cup Winners’ Cup, which provided its own enjoyable ragtag group of contenders until the late 1990s. The now defunct competition’s last 11 editions were won by teams from England, Spain, Italy, Germany or France, a trend coinciding almost precisely with the Champions League’s creation and subsequent expansion.
That ultimately put paid to the Cup Winners’ Cup. The Conference League was, by contrast, created with the Champions League’s overpopulation by the richest leagues thoroughly priced in. This year its league phase will include at least seven domestic champions from last season; a more extreme scenario, depending on results in a Europa League playoff round whose losing teams will be handed a Conference League safety net, would end with up to 15 participating. That is only one champion fewer than in the Champions League itself.
2022 Roma 1-0 Feyenoord Tirana
2023 West Ham 2-1 Fiorentina Prague
2024 Olympiakos 1-0 Fiorentina (aet) Athens
2025 Chelsea 4-1 Real Betis Wroclaw

Leicester reached semi-finals in 2022, losing to Roma
Aston Villa reached semis in 2024, losing to Olympiakos
Therein lies the real problem: the Conference League was formed in deference to a system that has allowed the wealthiest clubs, including the six from England who will play in the Champions League this season, to soar further away. If it solves the previous shortage of European games for clubs outside the elite, it cements the status quo and implicitly acknowledges that for most this will now be as good as things get. There is limited scope to barge into an increasingly embedded elite.
Hope bubbles up in the form of clubs such as Pafos, who stand on the verge of a debut in the Champions League proper after winning their playoff first leg at Red Star Belgrade. Exposure to last season’s Conference League did not harm the Cypriot champions in preparing for the next step. Slovan Bratislava, veterans of two Conference Leagues before reaching last year’s Champions League, offer further evidence that some form of mobility remains possible. The ultimate cost to their domestic leagues of a guaranteed £15.7m for reaching Europe’s flagship competition remains unclear.
This year’s Conference League may yet benefit from Palace’s relegation given Nottingham Forest, with whom they have swapped places, are plainly a stronger side. Perhaps Shakhtar Donetsk, Sparta Prague or Anderlecht can take advantage of the fact no one is likely to dominate to the extent Chelsea did.
As Palace shape up for a second-choice shot at glory, their fortunes may tell plenty about the wider health of football’s ecosystem.

Football Daily | Rangers and a slapstick fiasco that gave Martin a furious dose of fatal realism,Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/20/rangers-russell-martin-football-daily-newsletter,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 15:27:27",Barry Glendenning,['Manchester City'],"RAN-GRRRS
Football Daily would never publicly admit that our life is so meaningless, empty and utterly devoid of purpose that we occasionally spend our leisure time perusing the fan forums of random clubs with whom we have no affiliation just to pass the time. No, that would be embarrassing so it was purely in the interests of diligent professional research that we spent the buildup to one of last night’s Bigger Cup qualifiers scrutinising the long pre-match thread on a forum devoted to one fitba club in particular, all the better to gauge the mood among Rangers fans before their first leg against Club Brugge. Before a ball had been kicked, it was one of cautious optimism that was quickly replaced by fatal realism and no end of radge-induced McEffing and McJeffing a mere three minutes after kick-off. That’s how long it took for the hesitant-to-the-point-of-slumbering Rangers duo Nasser Djiga and Jack Butland to contrive to concede a goal so slapstick (but beautifully finished) that it would be worth resurrecting A Question of Sport for one final episode of What Happened Next?
A game that started badly for Rangers quickly slalomed downhill faster than Franz Klammer and after just 20 minutes a steady stream of irate fans could be seen heading for the Ibrox exits after watching their team go 3-0 down. Having already witnessed Rangers lurch and stumble through their opening two qualifiers like a drunk on his way home after a night at The Fist & Lizard, they had clearly seen enough and decided that, for this season at least, their team’s Bigger Cup jig and the £40m+ windfall that comes with it is almost certainly up. A second-half goal from Danilo took the bare look off Rangers’ side of the scoreboard and left their fans with that nagging feeling of faint hope that makes fools of us all but Ally McCoist gave his former side little more than a snowman’s chance in hell of turning the tie around when discussing last night’s fiasco on the wireless. “On that first-half performance, they couldn’t beat anybody to be honest,” he sighed. “To have any chance they’ve got to score first, that’s for sure but even I as the eternal optimist think it’ll be a big struggle.”
While the crowd at Ibrox had already made their mind up about Russell Martin before this game, it remains to be seen how long Rangers, who have recently burned through managers at a rate that would make even the Watford owners balk, will be prepared to keep him on board in the face of such obvious fan fury. The first appointment of the club’s new owners, 49ers Enterprises, Martin faced the obligatory questions from the press afterwards from behind a table bearing several bottles of Bigger Cup-sanctioned Crocodile Drink which he did his best to view as half-full. “That’s as hard as it will ever be for the players on the pitch,” he blathered of the opening 20 minutes. “I’m proud of how they responded. They all displayed courage in the second half. We recovered properly and we hurt them as much as they hurt us. That goal changes everything.”
In the unlikely event they exist, more level-headed Rangers fans will almost certainly concede their team simply does not have good enough players to avoid the humiliations that unlikely qualification for Bigger Cup will surely bring and with a consolation place in Bigger Vase already assured, their club’s future on the continent is not entirely bleak. However, regardless of where or who they play, there is widespread frustration over Martin’s team selections, player acquisitions and tactics after just eight games. The 39-year-old said he hoped to be “judged in May”, but the fact of the matter is the majority of the Ibrox jury reached their verdict before his appointment in June.
QUOTE OF THE DAY
I’m not at the [PFA awards] ceremony tonight. With everything going on, it didn’t feel right to be there. I’ve kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn’t reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors. The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading. When promises are broken and trust is lost the relationship can’t continue. That’s where things are for me right now – and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself” – the Alexander Isak transfer saga goes on (and on, and on), with the striker sounding like he’s almost at the stage where he’s going to write a painful breakup album if his latest Instachat post is anything to go by. Newcastle have been quick to fire back: “We are clear in response that Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer.” Make it end!

The great teams Crystal Palace can follow in their first season in Europe,"Hibernian, Birmingham, Newcastle and Fulham all enjoyed successful debut seasons in continental football",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/crystal-palace-europe-first-season-newcastle-fulham-birmingham,"Thu, 21 Aug 2025 07:00:05",Richard Foster,['Chelsea'],"After all the shenanigans with Uefa, Crystal Palace are now ready to make their debut in a major European competition, albeit the lesser Conference League. Palace have been involved in Europe before but only in minor competitions – three entries into the Anglo-Italian Cup and the long-forgotten 1998 Intertoto Cup campaign in which they lost 4-0 on aggregate to the Turkish club Samsunspor, who are back in Europe this season after a 27-year hiatus. Palace will be aiming to follow a long line of British clubs who have made impressive European debuts over the last 70 years.
When the European Cup was founded in 1955, the English league champions, Chelsea, were invited to take part but there was a major obstacle in the shape of Alan Hardaker. The xenophobic secretary of the Football League put pressure on Chelsea to decline the offer and the club capitulated.
It was left to Scotland to provide the first British club to enter a European competition, although the place did not go to the league champions, Aberdeen, who had just won their first title in 1955. The Scottish Football Association ended up choosing fifth-placed Hibernian instead. Some suggested the club were entered because they had won the league three times in the previous eight years and had an attractive style of play. Perhaps more significant, Easter Road was the only Scottish ground with floodlights so it could host midweek evening matches. There was also the fact that the Hibs chair, Harry Swan, just happened to be the president of the SFA, which may have influenced the selection.
Whatever the final criteria, Hibernian took the plunge away at the West German side Rot-Weiss Essen and it could hardly have gone much better. They won 4-0, with Eddie Turnbull having the honour of scoring the first goal for a British club in Europe. Hibs then beat Chelsea’s replacements, Djurgården, before losing to Reims in the semi-finals. This remains the only time Hibs have played in the European Cup, although they did reach the semi-finals of the Fairs Cup in 1961. After beating Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in the quarter-finals, Hibs came up against Roma in the last four. With the tie level at 5-5 after the two legs, and no away-goal rule in place, they returned to the Stadio Olimpico for a playoff, which Roma won 6-0.
Manchester United were the first English side to play in the European Cup, with Matt Busby insisting they defy Hardaker and take up their place in the 1956-57 season. United played Anderlecht in the first round and, after winning 2-0 in Belgium, they racked up a 10-0 win at Maine Road (as Old Trafford did not yet have floodlights), which remains their record victory in all competitions.
Dennis Viollet scored four and finished as the top scorer in the European Cup that season with nine goals, just above his teammate Tommy Taylor with eight and Alfredo Di Stéfano with seven. United then beat Borussia Dortmund and Athletic Bilbao but, like Hibs, they fell at the semi-final stage, losing 5-3 on aggregate to the eventual winners, Real Madrid.
The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the precursor to the Uefa Cup, also started in 1955. As its name suggests, the competition not only featured clubs but also teams that represented cities, picked from a variety of clubs. The first edition of the Fairs Cup ran over three seasons between 1955 and 1958, with a London XI featuring players from all 11 of the capital’s professional clubs, including Jimmy Greaves from Chelsea, Johnny Haynes from Fulham and Danny Blanchflower from Tottenham.
Birmingham City were the only English club that entered, doing so after Aston Villa rejected the opportunity to field a combined team for the city. They kicked off their campaign against Inter on 16 May 1956, making them the first English club to play in Europe. Birmingham breezed through their group, beating a Zagreb XI twice before a win against Inter sealed their place in the semi-finals. After beating a Barcelona XI 4-3 in the first leg at St Andrew’s, they lost 1-0 at the Camp Nou and, like Hibs before them, lost a playoff match. The London XI reached the final but were beaten 8-2 on aggregate by Barcelona. Birmingham reached the final of the Fairs Cup in 1960, making them the first British club to play in a European final, but they were also beaten by Barcelona.
In 1960, a third European competition was introduced with the launch of the Cup Winners’ Cup. Among the 10 clubs involved were Wolves and Rangers, who met in the semi-finals. The Scottish Cup winners, who had annihilated Borussia Mönchengladbach 11-0 on aggregate, beat their English counterparts 3-1 on aggregate, thus becoming the first Scottish club to reach a European final, which they lost to Fiorentina.
Two years later Tottenham became the first British club to win a European trophy when they beat Atlético Madrid 5-1 in the Cup Winners’ Cup final, with two goals each from Greaves and Terry Dyson plus one from John White. It was only their second season in Europe; they had reached the semi-finals of the European Cup the year before, losing to the eventual champions, Benfica, in the last four.
Liverpool also reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in their first season playing continental football, in 1964-65, and they were also knocked out by the eventual winners in the last four. They won the first leg at Anfield 3-1 but were beaten 3-0 by Inter at San Siro in the return fixture. The result did not go down well with the visiting players. “What happened left me feeling cheated,” said Tommy Smith. “The Italians didn’t win it – the referee won it for them – and the only surprise was that they didn’t carry him off shoulder high at the end.”
Nottingham Forest did even better in their first season in the European Cup, in 1978–79. They beat Liverpool in the first round – the first time two English clubs had met in the competition – and went all the way to the final, where they beat Malmö 1-0 to be crowned European champions. Aston Villa also won the European Cup in their first attempt, in 1981–82, beating Bayern Munich in the final.
The first British side to win the European Cup at the first attempt were from Scotland. Celtic built up some European experience in the mid-1960s, reaching the Cup Winners’ Cup semi-finals in 1964 and 1966, before they qualified for the European Cup for the first time in the 1966-67 season. They beat FC Zürich, Nantes, Vojvodina and Dukla Prague to set up a daunting final against Inter, the champions of 1964 and 1965, in Lisbon. Celtic overcame the odds in the final, coming from behind to win 2-1 and become the first British side crowned champions of Europe.
If Palace are looking for some inspiration as they begin their campaign this week, they should also look to Newcastle, who remain the only English club to have won a European trophy in their first season playing continental football. They won the Fairs Cup in 1969 and did it in some style, beating Feyenoord, Sporting Lisbon, Real Zaragoza, Vitória Setúbal and Rangers along the way before hammering the Hungarian side Ujpest Dozsa 6-2 in the final.
For a more contemporary precedent, Fulham went all way to the Europa League final in 2009-10, in just their second campaign in Europe (they won the Intertoto Cup as well as playing in the Uefa Cup in their first). Guided by Roy Hodgson, they knocked out Juventus in the last 16 thanks to a sensational 4-1 win at Craven Cottage. Victories against the German clubs Wolfsburg and Hamburg set up a final against Atlético Madrid at the Volksparkstadion, which they lost narrowly after extra time.
If Palace can emulate Fulham, Newcastle, Birmingham City and Hibs, the disappointment of missing out on the Europa League will be tempered by a successful debut in Europe.

Alexander Isak and Newcastle approach point of no return after striker’s outburst,Club say they want to keep Isak but a move is now in the interest of both and Eddie Howe is best off chasing other targets,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/20/alexander-isak-and-newcastle-approach-point-of-no-return-after-strikers-latest-outburst,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 12:30:12",Louise Taylor,['Liverpool'],"As a general rule, it is almost always best to sleep on things before making important decisions or reacting to provocations. So why, at close to midnight on Tuesday, did Newcastle rush out a seemingly kneejerk response to Alexander Isak’s incendiary Instagram post claiming that, amid broken promises, his relationship with the club was over?
In a statement reflecting an appreciably tougher tone than at any time during this summer saga, Newcastle insisted no promises had been broken and that their intention is to keep Isak. The message was that the Sweden striker’s attempt to force a move to Liverpool had failed and he would need to end his one-man strike before being welcomed back to first-team training. The only problem is that while you can lead a horse to water it sometimes really is impossible to make them drink.
Even if – and right now it looks a pretty big if – Isak stops training alone and agrees to rejoin Newcastle’s first-team fold, how can Eddie Howe ever trust him again? Howe’s high-intensity, hard‑pressing approach is extremely demanding and, if Isak is anything less than fully engaged, he will prove detrimental to the team. Yes, Isak is supremely gifted, but the standard in the Premier League and Champions League is so high that even he is not capable of drifting through games and scoring goals out of nothing.
Howe has already acknowledged that Isak’s behaviour in skipping Newcastle’s pre-season tour of south-east Asia disrupted dressing‑room morale. Does he really want a player, however talented, polluting behind‑the‑scenes atmosphere with his grievances? Given Newcastle fans have taken to chanting about “one greedy bastard”, maintaining his personal security in the face of intense supporter anger may not be exactly straightforward, either.
Moreover, Isak knows that with every poor performance the price tag around his neck will drop. Given that Liverpool have shown no indication of pursuing alternative strikers, they could end up playing a slightly longer game and waiting until Newcastle are desperate to offload their No 14 in January. In reality it will be a major surprise if this saga endures that long. Indeed a careful reading of Newcastle’s statement conveys a hint that maybe it is part of a haggling manoeuvre as the club’s Saudi Arabian owners aim to extract the maximum possible price from their Anfield counterparts. As the former Newcastle and Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez used to say: “All football is a lie.”
In their statement on Tuesday night Newcastle said: “We have been clear that the conditions for a sale this summer have not transpired. We do not foresee these conditions being met.” The conditions in question refer to the need for Newcastle to sign two strikers to not merely replace Isak but also Callum Wilson, who is now at West Ham. There is a theory that Isak’s withering social media outburst reflected his frustration at the club’s unwillingness to pay Brentford’s £50m-£60m asking fee for Yoane Wissa to fill at least one of those slots. In an uncanny parallel, Wissa has also absented himself from first-team involvement at his club as he attempts to seal a longed‑for move to St James’ Park.
The ostensibly weird thing about the proposed Wissa deal is that the Saudis want £150m for Isak but have offered Brentford £40m for the DR Congo forward. Statistics can be deceptive but in this case they seem pretty compelling. Last season Wissa scored 19 goals in 35 Premier League appearances. Significantly, none were penalties. Isak, meanwhile, scored 23 times in 34 league appearances for a much stronger side. Four of his goals were also penalties.
There is a reasonable case for claiming that Isak’s all-round game is superior to Wissa’s, but Brentford watchers demur, making the point that Wissa is also a pretty useful attacking threat from wide on the left. The big difference is that Wissa is three years older than Isak. Perhaps more importantly, while three years remain on Isak’s contract with Newcastle, there is only one year left on Wissa’s with Brentford.
Newcastle’s £40m offer for Wissa, made on Wednesday afternoon, was swiftly rejected by Brentford but the hope of the club’s Saudi owners will be that a deal will eventually be done. They also know that keeping Isak for another year could prove rather pointless given that he is clearly not committed to Howe’s cause and next summer’s price for a then 26-year-old with two years left on his contract is going to be nowhere near £150m.
Despite appearances to the contrary, the prospect of such a dwindling profit margin means it is still eminently possible to envisage Isak waking up as a Liverpool player on 2 September. Similarly, Jørgen Strand Larsen or Gonçalo Ramos could join Wissa on Tyneside by the time the transfer window has shut. And should that all transpire, what’s for sure is that Newcastle’s dressing room would be an infinitely healthier, happier place.

Newcastle’s improved £40m offer for Yoane Wissa rejected by Brentford,Striker is valued between £50m-£60m by current club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/20/newcastle-brentford-yoane-wissa-transfer-window,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 15:24:35",Louise Taylor,['Liverpool'],"Newcastle have had an improved £40m bid for Yoane Wissa rejected by Brentford as they seek to reinforce Eddie Howe’s attack amid uncertainty regarding the future of Alexander Isak.
As Isak trains separately from his Newcastle teammates in an attempt to force a move to Liverpool, Wissa missed Brentford’s 3-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest last weekend as he, in turn, attempted to push through a transfer to St James’ Park. Newcastle insist Isak will not be allowed to leave the club this summer. Wissa’s potential arrival could yet alter that narrative.
Despite suggestions from within St James’ Park that Wissa is seen primarily as a replacement for Callum Wilson following the latter’s move to West Ham this summer, it is striking how much the 28-year-old’s Premier League scoring statistics from last season mirror those of Isak. Wissa scored 19 goals in 35 appearances for Brentford, all from open play, while Isak managed 23 goals in 34 appearances, with four of those resulting from penalties.
Although Wissa, who turns 29 next month, has only one year remaining on his contract, Brentford are reluctant to lose him after their manager Thomas Frank departed for Tottenham, their captain, Christian Nørgaard, joined Arsenal, and Bryan Mbeumo, Wissa’s strike partner at the Gtech Community Stadium, left for Manchester United this summer.
Newcastle’s initial £25m offer for the DR Congo forward was rejected but it was widely expected they would return. Their latest offer, submitted within hours of Isak’s incendiary Instagram post in which he claimed Newcastle had broken promises and breached his trust, is believed to be an initial £35m with a further £5m in add-ons. Brentford did not wait long to tell Newcastle it also fell short of their valuation for Wissa, which is believed to be between £50m and £60m.
They could well sell should Newcastle make another improved offer given the player’s attempts to leave, which have included deleting all Brentford references from his social media accounts. The west London club have also added the forward Dango Ouattara to their ranks, increasing Newcastle’s confidence of a deal being done in the coming days. Any agreement is unlikely to come in time for Howe to field Wissa in the hotly anticipated Premier League meeting with Liverpool at St James’ Park on Monday night.

Eze and Guéhi to start for Crystal Palace in Europe despite transfer activity,Palace play in Conference League playoff on Thursday,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/20/eberechi-eze-marc-guehi-crystal-palace-conference-league-transfer-window,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 20:53:44",Ed Aarons,"['Arsenal', 'Liverpool', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Oliver Glasner has confirmed that Eberechi Eze and Marc Guéhi will both start in the first leg of Crystal Palace’s Conference League playoff on Thursday and insisted that the England pair remain committed to the club despite continuing doubts about their futures.
Arsenal on Wednesday night agreed a £68m deal for Eze, after it looked as though the 27-year-old was heading for Spurs. Liverpool, meanwhile, are leading the race to sign Guéhi but have yet to meet Palace’s valuation of £40m for their captain, whose contract at Selhurst Park expires next year.
Both players started the goalless draw at Chelsea on Sunday despite speculation that Eze could be absent as negotiations with Spurs continued and they would be eligible to play in the Champions League even if selected to face Norway’s cup winners Fredrikstad on Thursday. Glasner was adamant that the pair will feature and he praised Eze and Guéhi for the way they have conducted themselves this week.
“I think it’s also the right of a club and the duty of a player to give 100% as long as he’s under contract,” the Palace manager said. “On the other side, I know this is the theory. I think many of you were surprised that Marc and Ebs started and played almost the whole game [against Chelsea]. Most of you will be surprised that they will start again tomorrow because of all the rumours, but again they are committed to the team.
“They have a contract here. They played a crucial part that we could be so successful and they will play a crucial part as long as they are here. When one of the players will leave, which I don’t know at the moment, they want to leave as the players who always give 100% for Crystal Palace.”
Asked whether he was surprised by how Eze and Guéhi have handled the speculation surrounding them, the Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson said: “No, I think the pair of them are great lads and they’re so committed and so professional. I’m sure they’ll keep staying committed throughout and they’re always here to help the team and they’re part of us at the minute, so we’ll keep enjoying it.”
In the first taste of a major European competition in their history, Palace will face Fredrikstad for a place in the Conference League after being demoted from the Europa League by Uefa for contravening its rules on multiclub ownership.
Glasner was keen not to underestimate Palace’s opponents but believes his FA Cup‑winning side can use the disappointment of missing out on the more prestigious competition as motivation for more success.
“I think if you win the FA Cup, you should be in the Europa League, but the reality is we’re excited for the journey we’re going to go on this season,” he said.
“It’s the reward for the club to take part in the European competition for all their effort last season.”
Meanwhile, Palace are understood to be close to agreeing a deal with Leicester to sign Bilal El Khannouss as a potential replacement for Eze. They have also shown interest in Christos Tzolis but Club Brugge are reluctant to sell the Greek forward this summer.
The former Bournemouth and Newcastle defender Lloyd Kelly – now at Juventus – is an option to replace Guéhi should he depart, and Glasner is keen to add Hwang Hee-chan on loan but must wait until Wolves can secure a replacement for the South Korean forward.
