Carragher slams 'absolutely shocking' Liverpool defending,"Jamie Carragher hit out at Liverpool's ""unbelievable"" and ""absolutely shocking"" defending in their 4-2 win over Bournemouth - saying they will not retain their Premier League title if they continue with those standards.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13412521/liverpool-4-2-bournemouth-jamie-carragher-says-reds-must-fix-absolutely-shocking-defending-if-they-want-to-retain-premier-league-title,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 22:32:00",Jamie Carragher,['Liverpool'],"Jamie Carragher hit out at Liverpool's ""unbelievable"" and ""absolutely shocking"" defending in their 4-2 win over Bournemouth - saying they will not retain their Premier League title if they continue with those standards.
Liverpool won on an emotional night at Anfield thanks to late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah - but they were given a real scare by the Cherries as Antoine Semenyo's quickfire double cancelled out goals either side of half-time by Hugo Ekitike and Cody Gakpo.
Both of Semenyo's goals saw Liverpool caught out on the transition - with Bournemouth's second goal seeing the young forward run nearly the length of the pitch before finding the bottom corner.
Carragher also hit out at Ibrahima Konate, who he felt was responsible for poor defending for both goals.
""It is unbelievable,"" said Carragher on Friday Night Football after the game. ""It's fantastic from Semenyo - but Liverpool have had this problem.
""How many players were ahead of the ball - maybe eight players - when they were winning 2-1? That can't happen. It's absolutely shocking at this level.
""For Semenyo to run that far and get his shot away is incredible - but where Konate is going? He had a really, really poor night tonight at centre-back.""
Carragher added that Liverpool's defending has been poor during their pre-season campaign. There were similar goals conceded in the 4-2 defeat against AC Milan, while they also conceded twice against Athletic Club and Crystal Palace in the Community Shield.
The Sky Sports pundit was also critical of Liverpool's defending at Wembley - and suggested on Friday night that it is too easy for teams to cut through Arne Slot's side.
""That is not right. It's not,"" said Carragher. ""It's only game on top of the Community Shield - but I've watched enough football in my life. This idea that everyone bombs forward, it's not for me. I don't like it.
""At no time last week in the Community Shield did I ever feel Liverpool were in control of the game. You can draw 2-2 with Palace, that can happen. But it's how easy Crystal Palace could get at Liverpool, how easy it was tonight.
""In the first half, Bournemouth should have been at least 2-0 up at one stage.""
Liverpool's poor defending comes alongside the club's pursuit of a centre-back during the final weeks of the window.
The Reds secured the £26m signing of Parma centre-back Giovanni Leoni on Friday - but they have also been strongly linked with a move for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi.
There is also Konate's situation - with the French international entering the final year of his Liverpool contract - amid rumours linking the defender to Real Madrid next season.
But Carragher believes that any new defender would not fix Liverpool's overall problem of being too easy to attack against.
""There is definitely a problem that Arne Slot has to solve,"" Carragher said.
""People say they need a centre-back - a centre-back doesn't fix that. He just takes Konate's place.
""It's about the make-up of the team with two attacking full-backs and a No 10 who is more interested in getting on the ball than defending like [Dominik] Szoboszlai was last season.
""If Liverpool continue like that, I don't think they will win the league.""
Slot responded to Carragher's comment, saying Liverpool are more vulnerable on the counter-attack due to the absence of Ryan Gravenberch, with Alexis Mac Allister also lacking sharpness in midfield.
""I do talk about a player who was not available last week and not this week. That's Ryan Gravenberch,"" said Slot. ""Last season, he was very, very important in these moments.
""So with Alexis Mac Allister only being back two or three weeks in pre-season, we lost a little bit of that control in our midfield. But Ryan will be back next week and Macca will be fitter. And we will find a balance in taking risks because against Palace, we lost two or three simple balls to counter-attacks.""
And responding to Carragher's comments about Liverpool throwing too many bodies forward, Slot said he has no plans to change his philosophy.
""That's also who we were and who we are - and that's why we see such a nice game if you watch Liverpool,"" said the Reds boss. ""We are not going to a low block to defend.""
Carragher replied: ""That worries me a little, you saying that's the team that we are, with bodies going forward.""
""You're allowed to say this,"" said the Liverpool head coach. ""But then you need to support a team that plays 11 players in their own box. I prefer to see [what Liverpool did against Bournemouth].
""But I prefer even more to not see ourselves counter-attacked - that I agree on. But I like that our players like to play football - last season we were a joy to watch. Paris Saint-Germain do similar things to this.""

'When will it stop?' - Semenyo speaks out after alleged racist abuse,"A 47-year-old man was ejected from Anfield following reports of racist abuse directed towards Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo during their Premier League opener against Liverpool, Merseyside Police said.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13412406/bournemouths-antoine-semenyo-subjected-to-alleged-racist-comment-in-premier-league-opener,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:45:00",,['Liverpool'],"A 47-year-old man was ejected from Anfield following reports of racist abuse directed towards Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo during their Premier League opener against Liverpool, Merseyside Police said.
Police said an investigation is under way after the man's identity was confirmed and he was removed from the ground.
The match was stopped in the 28th minute after an alleged racist comment was aimed at Semenyo.
Semenyo was also subjected to racist abuse on Instagram on Friday night. The 25-year-old shared some of the abuse on his story, with the caption: ""when will it stop?""
Meta has told Sky Sports News it is investigating. It is understood the social media company are removing comments and disabling the offending accounts.
Arne Slot and Andoni Iraola were spoken to by the referee Anthony Taylor when the incident at Anfield occurred, leading to the game being paused.
""I am told via the Premier League Match Centre that Antoine Semenyo was the subject of a racist comment from the crowd,"" reported Sky Sports' Peter Drury on commentary.
""It was Semenyo himself who brought attention to it.""
Sky Sports' Laura Hunter, in attendance at Anfield, later reported a fan was ejected from the stadium.
""In the wake of the game being halted after Semenyo reported racist abused, Liverpool staff and members of the police have been in conversation on the side of the pitch and during half time.
""And just before the second half started, we have seen a fan being escorted away by police officers.""
Bournemouth captain Adam Smith described the incident as ""unacceptable"" while head coach Iraola added: ""It's a big shame, most of the news will be about this thing. Obviously, it is something that is still a big problem, not just in football.
""From the Liverpool side, they have identified this person.""
The Premier League said the incident will now be ""fully investigated"".
""Tonight's match between Liverpool Football Club and AFC Bournemouth was temporarily paused during the first half after a report of discriminatory abuse from the crowd, directed at Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo. This is in line with the Premier League's on-field anti-discrimination protocol,"" the Premier League said in a statement.
""The incident at Anfield will now be fully investigated. We offer our full support to the player and both clubs. Racism has no place in our game, or anywhere in society. We will continue to work with stakeholders and authorities to ensure our stadiums are an inclusive and welcoming environment for all.""
Liverpool said in a statement they ""condemn racism and discrimination in all forms"" and that they would fully support the ongoing police investigation into the incident.
The FA said it was ""very concerned"" by the incident and would work with the relevant parties to ""ensure the appropriate action is taken"".
""We are very concerned about the allegation of discrimination from an area of the crowd, which was reported to the match officials during the Premier League fixture between Liverpool and Bournemouth,"" the FA said in a statement.
""Incidents of this nature have no place in our game, and we will work closely with the match officials, the clubs and the relevant authorities to establish the facts and ensure the appropriate action is taken.""
Bournemouth captain Adam Smith told Sky Sports he was ""angry"" and ""shocked"" by the incident, which occurred before Semenyo scored twice in a 4-2 defeat.
""It's totally unacceptable,"" he said. ""I'm in shock that it happened. In this day and age, it shouldn't be happening. I don't know how Ant has played on and come up with those goals. I feel sorry for Ant. He's a little bit down. Something needs to be done. Taking a knee is not having an effect. We'll support him in there and hopefully he'll be okay.
""I wanted him (Semenyo) to react because that's what I would have done. I would have gone straight over there. It shows what type of man he is to not react, even in the moment when it happened to not react, to carry on, then he reported it to the ref. To come up with those goals shows what type of guy he is and what type of character he has. Fair play to Ant.
""It's more angry, to be honest. Shocked. I said to the ref I wanted him (the supporter) removed immediately. He said we have to go through a process and the police will sort it. The Liverpool players were very supportive as well to Antoine and the rest of the team. I think it was handled in the right way, but just so angry.
""We've had discussions with the Premier League [about discriminatory comments] so they've been taking it seriously, but speaking to some of the lads in there, I don't know what else we can do. We've been doing it for a long time now and no one is getting it. I don't know what to say anymore. I just feel sorry for Ant, who has had to take that tonight. The whole country is watching and for that to happen is shocking.""
Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola said:
""I did not notice live, there were a lot of people shouting. But straight away, Antoine and the referee explained the situation to both managers. From the Liverpool side, they have identified this person.
""It's a shame that the first game of the Premier League, we have to start talking about things we have conceded in the past. Clearly, it is not in the past because we have to continue to reinforce the messages.
""Antoine was calm, he continued playing. We asked him, he was fine to continue, he looked composed. Unfortunately, the head always goes to these things and he's for sure asking, 'Why are these things still happening today?' It's a big shame.""
Liverpool head coach Arne Slot said:
""It's under investigation with the police now. We've made a very clear statement. This day should be about Diogo (Jota) and the tribute, but we have to address this. It's unacceptable. I spoke to him (Semenyo) after the game to say we will do everything to find this person and wherever we can we will try to help.
""Credit to him, he's very strong mentally, to get such a strong second-half performance after this shows the kind of player he is. Unacceptable in football in general, let alone at Anfield.""
Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk told Sky Sports:
""I spoke to him during and after the game. I'm glad that the authorities are dealing with it. I told him anything he needs from us, we are here for him. I stand by him. It will be dealt with by the authorities and the club.
""I can speak for all Liverpool fans that these things can't happen and they will all agree that Antoine needs our support.""
Sky Sports' Gary Neville:
""It overshadows what should be an amazing night. The first day of the Premier League season, a beautiful day. And that boy has [reported being] racially abused. It's despicable. I can't imagine what is going through that fan's mind. However, it has happened. It will keep on happening. It's a sorry state.
""Four or five weeks ago, Salford City, a club I part own, there was an incident of racism and the manager and players walked off the pitch and didn't finish the last seven or eight minutes of the game. I'm not saying that should have happened tonight but we're going to get to a point where players are going to rally round if these incidents keep occurring in stadiums.
""You can see the players' disappointment, the shock, and Semenyo went on to have the most incredible second half after what he experienced which says a lot about his personality and character.
""It's despicable, it really is. Enough is enough. I know we've said that for a long time now but it continues to keep happening. It's a criminal offence if it is proven and that should mean serious consequences for that person, I'm not just talking about stopping them from watching Liverpool; that's an absolute given.""
Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher:
""With the amount of campaigns we have, it's shocking to see an incident like that. A shocking incident and rightly reported to the referee.
""There's a lot of good work that gets done up and down the country in terms of the football side of it. I understand where Adam Smith is coming from about what else we can do about it and that these things aren't working. It's also difficult when you've just got one idiot in the crowd, how do you police that?""

Amorim says 'football obsessed' Sesko 'ready to play' against Arsenal,"Ruben Amorim says new signing Benjamin Sesko is ""ready to play"" in Manchester United's Premier League curtain raiser against rivals Arsenal.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13412147/benjamin-sesko-ruben-amorim-says-manchester-united-striker-ready-to-make-debut-against-arsenal,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:31:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Ruben Amorim says new signing Benjamin Sesko is ""ready to play"" in Manchester United's Premier League curtain raiser against rivals Arsenal.
United will begin their bid to improve on the club's record lowly finish of 15th place last campaign when they host last season's Premier League runners-up Arsenal.
The Old Trafford faithful may be given a first glimpse of summer recruit Sesko alongside Premier League debuts for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.
Sesko, who had also been linked with a move to Sunday's opponents Arsenal earlier in the transfer window, completed a move to Old Trafford last week in a move worth £74m from RB Leipzig. Asked whether the 22-year-old striker would be involved from the start against the Gunners, Amorim said:
""He hasn't had a lot of time, [but] physically he's ready.
""He's really smart, a guy who's always thinking. He is ready to play but we'll see if he's going to start.""
Quizzed further about Sesko, Amorim lauded the Slovenia international for his attitude, suggesting United had found a player who could lead the line for the club for years to come.
""He [Sesko] has great potential,"" Amorim said.
""He has a great potential in everything he does. He can play a different type of football. He is going to feel that the Premier League is aggressive. He is going to learn.
""But Ben can be a striker for United for a lot of years, that's why we paid so much money to have a striker who will have his history in our club.""
""He's one guy who stays here, has lunch, and goes to the medical department, does the stretching.
""He is always thinking about football. He's really obsessed about that and that is a good thing because you don't have to think about that aspect with that young guy.
""I don't need to tell Ben, 'Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready, every game is like do or die'.
""With that guy, I don't have that concern. I have the opposite, enjoy a little bit.
""I really like that [he asks questions], especially when it is smart questions so he's listened and he wants to perform so that is very good.""
Sesko's arrival at Old Trafford has plunged Rasmus Hojlund's United future into further doubt. The Danish striker, who struggled for form last season, is understood to be open to a move to AC Milan, according to Sky in Italy.
Talks are understood to have taken place between Milan and the 22-year-old's representatives with Milan expected to accelerate talks with United over a loan with an option to buy. Other clubs, including Borussia Dortmund, are said to be keeping an eye on Hojlund's situation.
Asked whether Hojlund still had a role to play in the team, Amorim played down claims that Hojlund was surplus to requirements.
""He is one more option, we will see [about his future]. We are focused on Arsenal. Rasmus [Hojlund] is still our player.""
""Benjamin Sesko is a big prospect but one with plenty to prove and his success could be crucial to Manchester United's rebuild under Ruben Amorim.
""The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.""

'Ekitike is instant Anfield hero but defence brutally exposed',"Hugo Ekitike's headline act does not disguise flaws which Liverpool boss Arne Slot must address, says BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy985dxw33jo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 23:00:10",Phil McNulty,['Liverpool'],"Hugo Ekitike was Liverpool's headline act on a night of pure theatre at Anfield which was high on emotion and rich in thrilling drama, but also played out under the shadow of allegations of racist abuse.
Ekitike might face a future fight for his place only weeks after making a £70m move from Eintracht Frankfurt, with Newcastle United rebel Alexander Isak still on Liverpool's agenda - but he stated his case eloquently with a superb individual display that made him an instant hero on The Kop.
Liverpool's 4-2 win, secured with late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah, was packed with sub-plots - not all of them good. Indeed, the scoreline barely touches the sides of a chaotic night.
It all started with emotional tributes to Diogo Jota, the Liverpool striker killed in a car crash in July, along with his brother Andre Silva.
The Kop was adorned with banners paying tribute to Jota, including one for his family reading: 'Anfield will always be your home. You'll Never Walk Alone' before a minute's silence.
Jota was remembered in song throughout, with a rousing minute of applause after 20 minutes for the beloved striker who wore the number 20 shirt.
It was a night when Liverpool's expensive transition was on display, with four Premier League newcomers including Ekitike and Florian Wirtz, as well as full-back pair Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.
The scale of change is illustrated by the fact that, excluding the inaugural 1992-93 season, Liverpool are the first reigning champions to name as many as four Premier League debutants in their opening-day starting line-up.
Ekitike was the best of that quartet by a distance, throwing up a conundrum about how head coach Arne Slot will adapt should Liverpool return to Tyneside with a bid closer to the striker Newcastle rate at £150m.
Slot has barely used a strike pairing since he arrived at Liverpool, so it would be a change of gear to combine Ekitike and Isak should the latter arrive.
It may not quite beg the question of whether Liverpool actually need to make such a lavish outlay on another striker, but it will give Slot a conundrum to solve.
For now, Slot can revel in the talent of Ekitike, who added to his Community Shield goal against Crystal Palace with a vibrant performance here - not only breaking the deadlock with a composed first-half finish but also creating a second for Cody Gakpo.
Ekitike could have had a hat-trick, missing two presentable headed chances, but this was a performance rich in promise that suggests he is a Premier League-ready striker, irrespective of further Liverpool transfer activity.
The calm manner of his finish and smart link play was a far cry from the frenetic approach of the now departed 'Captain Chaos' Darwin Nunez. Indeed, he is only the second player to both score and assist a goal on his Premier League debut for Liverpool - after the Uruguayan against Fulham in August 2022.
Ekitike made a '20' gesture in honour of Jota after scoring, while Salah replicated the beloved Portuguese's trademark shark celebration after he wrapped up the win.
If Ekitike was the highlight, the defensive vulnerability that troubled Liverpool in pre-season and in the Community Shield was brutally exposed once more by Bournemouth's excellence.
The absence of the suspended Ryan Gravenberch left gaping holes in Liverpool's midfield, while the attacking approach of new full-back pairing Frimpong and Kerkez left space on the flanks to be exploited.
Liverpool's weakness was punished by Bournemouth's second goal, a fine equaliser from Antoine Semenyo that left Anfield living on its nerves - a goal of individual ambition but one of concern for the reigning Premier League champions.
Salah lost the ball on the edge of Bournemouth's penalty area, Semenyo subsequently racing unchallenged for 50 yards - Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate merely onlookers before he coolly found the bottom corner.
Slot brought a calm, methodical approach to Liverpool's game last season following the magnificent chaos of Jurgen Klopp's reign, but this was a throwback summed up by that grandstand finish.
It was also an indication that a balance must be achieved between the players who won the title last season and the integration of £300m worth of new acquisitions.
Sadly, a night of superb football entertainment was marred by alleged racist abuse towards Semenyo in the first half by a member of the crowd. Referee Anthony Taylor halted the game as it was reported to him.
Semenyo's response was a brilliant performance that almost earned the Cherries a point, but once again racism reared its ugly head and was widely condemned.
Liverpool earned the win, but this was an almighty scare which acted as confirmation that Slot may face some early bumps in the road after last season's stroll to the title.
For Ekitike, however, this was the perfect start.

New-look Man City aim to bounce back amid uncertainty,"Manchester City head into the new season with the cloud of their financial charges still hovering over them, while there are questions on how quickly their new signings will integrate into the set-up.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1dxxk2w0w4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 16 Aug 2025 05:52:32",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City head into the new season with the cloud of financial charges still hovering over them, while there are questions on how quickly their new signings will integrate into the set-up.
Having been dominant with four successive Premier League titles, Pep Guardiola's all-conquering side endured a bitterly disappointing 2024-25 campaign.
They finished third in the table, failed to win a major trophy and suffered a shock last-16 exit from the Fifa Club World Cup at the hands of Saudi Arabia's Al-Ahli.
City will be a wounded beast, but there is uncertainty as to how they will respond to last season's struggles and whether Guardiola can build another title-winning machine.
""We are ready,"" said the Spaniard. ""We had a short pre-season but a really good one and we are ready to go, to enjoy the good moments and bounce back as soon as possible.
""I cannot assure you, but the signs are that we can be better. Maybe we can be worse! You never know. But I think it will be better.""
Charges verdict rumbles on
Last Sunday, the giant electronic advertising board close to Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium served a reminder it has been ""246 days since Man City's FFP hearing ended"".
That has since ticked on to 252 days and we are no closer to knowing the outcome of City's 115 charges for allegedly breaching the Premier League's financial rules, which were first published in February 2023.
The hearing took place in front of an independent commission between September and December of last year, but there has been no indication as to when the findings will be announced.
City have strongly denied the charges but, if found guilty, the commission could sanction a massive points deduction or the unthinkable scenario of relegation.
A decision was widely expected to arrive in the first quarter of 2025 and boss Guardiola provided a timeline of ""in one month"" back in February, but that has now dragged into another season.
The sheer scale of charges and amount of evidence has led to October now being mooted for the time of the verdict, but there has been no official confirmation of this.
The club has declined to comment, while Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said they have ""no influence"" on the timing and it would be ""wrong"" for him to speculate.
In the meantime, it has been business as usual for City.
Star striker Erling Haaland signed a new bumper contract which expires in 2034 and the club extended their kit partnership with Puma for a record £100m per season, making it the largest such deal in the Premier League.
Since January, they have spent almost £400m on new signings as Guardiola reshaped his squad in an attempt to reclaim the Premier League trophy.
Are City flying under the radar?
It isn't that often Guardiola gets it wrong in the transfer market but of the four January signings, only Egypt forward Omar Marmoush can be classed as a success after scoring eight goals, including a hat-trick against Newcastle.
Uzbek defender Abdukodir Khusanov barely got a look-in after March, Brazilian centre-back Vitor Reis has now been sent on loan to Girona, while there appear doubts over whether Guardiola trusts midfielder Nico Gonzalez.
City's summer strategy was to bolster the squad by addressing the problem areas, bringing in Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves to fill the hole at left-back, while box-to-box Dutchman Tijjani Reijnders will bring much-needed energy to the midfield.
Club legend Kevin de Bruyne and Jack Grealish left in the summer and it may fall to Frenchman Rayan Cherki to pick up the mantle of attacking creativity, while James Trafford will provide goalkeeping competition to Ederson as the Brazilian enters the final year of his contract.
City desperately missed the presence of Rodri in the middle of the park during an injury-ravaged season for the club and the Spaniard is unlikely to be fully fit until September after a setback.
The dressing room has lost serial winners in De Bruyne, Grealish and former captain Kyle Walker so, while Guardiola will be hoping the new boys quickly grasp his vision and settle in immediately, are City flying under the radar?
Aside from the acquisition of Trafford from Burnley, City did the bulk of their transfer business in June before the Club World Cup, while signings such as Florian Wirtz for champions Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal caught the headlines.
Club sources have pointed to new captain Bernardo Silva having the experience to galvanise a side which underperformed to their previous high standards last term, when he leads them out against Wolves on Saturday (kick-off 17:30 BST).
One insider said ""don't count us out"" and it would be foolish to do so for a side that has been champions in six of the last eight seasons.
Guardiola to relight fire - or is the end near?
Last season will have been a shock to Guardiola, finishing outside of the top two for only the second time in 15 seasons as manager at City, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.
Starting a 10th season with City, the 54-year-old is currently the Premier League's longest-serving boss and has said he will take a break from management once he leaves.
Like the great Sir Alex Ferguson did over at neighbours Manchester United, Guardiola will need to show he still has the desire to re-energise himself and his team in an attempt to overthrow Arne Slot's Liverpool and return to the summit again.
Not only has the playing squad been refreshed, but the coaching staff too. Jurgen Klopp's former Liverpool assistant Pep Lijnders has joined in a similar role, and set-piece coach James French has also arrived from the Reds, while Kolo Toure was promoted from the youth set-up.
But former City and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann has cast doubt over whether Guardiola has the ability to go again, telling BBC Radio 5 Live: ""When a season starts, you've got to light a fire in a team, with the fans, and make people believe. And I'm not sure he's got that fire any more.
""I'm not sure they're going to win another big title under Guardiola. I'd be surprised, to be honest.""
Spanish football expert Guillem Balague added: ""The fire that we see now - what we see in his eyes, in the jokes with his players and how he returned refreshed from the summer - can that continue until the end of the season?
""He has a two-year contract until 2027 and 100% by the end of the two years he will not continue with club football. But nobody can say that may not happen earlier, that this could be his last season.
""Is he excited because it is his last season or is it because he really feels he has a team in his hands which he can mould and create a new Manchester City, a third version?
""If he sees himself having the ability to continue then we will see a second year but we will not see a third. We are seeing the end of Pep Guardiola as a manager.""

'Diogo's day' - emotional Anfield tribute for Jota,"Liverpool winger Federico Chiesa dedicates the defending champions' win over Bournemouth in their Premier League opener to the late Diogo Jota, describing it as 'Diogo's day'.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c15l73w28yko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 22:35:34",Charlotte Coates,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool winger Federico Chiesa dedicated his side's dramatic win over Bournemouth in their Premier League opener to the late Diogo Jota, describing it as 'Diogo's day'.
Reds forward Jota died at the age of 28 in a car crash in northern Spain in July, alongside his brother Andre Silva, 25.
Emotional tributes were paid before, during and after Friday's 4-2 victory at Anfield - sealed by two late goals for the defending champions - with Mohamed Salah in tears as he applauded the fans at full-time.
Italian Chiesa, who scored Liverpool's third goal in the 88th minute before Salah's added-time effort, told BBC Sport: ""[The goal] was a great moment for me, but my thoughts go to Diogo. I think for what we have seen, it was his day.
""The feeling the fans gave me, chanting his song all the way through the match, it was very emotional, very emotional for me. I have to say that after the goal my thoughts went to his family, his brother Andre. That's the only thing I could say.""
With Jota's family in attendance, a rousing rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' before kick-off was followed by a period of silence as a fan-led mosaic in the Kop and Sir Kenny Dalglish stand were held up to read 'DJ20' and 'AS30'.
Fans sang ""Oh he wears the number 20"" in tribute as the players made their way on to the pitch prior to kick-off and in the 20th minute, with a flag in the Kop saying 'Anfield will always be your home'.
Liverpool led 2-0 before Antoine Semenyo struck twice to level for Bournemouth.
""Normally at 2-2 everyone knows which player I look to at that moment in time,"" said Reds boss Arne Slot.
""I would have loved to bring in Diogo Jota, but I could not for terrible reasons. But the fans and the players did what he did for us many times in the past.
""The main emotion I think should be how impressive and how powerful the tribute for Diogo was.
""I actually didn't want to go in after the game because I found it so special, how our fans reacted today.
""I think Mo felt, after the game, how special that was. He probably also felt the emotion because we all knew his (Jota's) family is here, his wife is here, his children are here.
""For them, it might be special to hear how much he is loved over here. What the fans did. But we also feel the emotions of how much grief they still have.""
A moment of silence will be held at all Premier League matches this weekend, with players wearing black armbands, while messages and images will be shown on the big screens in stadiums.
Liverpool's players will have a 'Forever 20' emblem on their shirts and stadium jackets throughout the season.
The Reds won a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title last season with Jota wearing the number 20 shirt, which the club decided to retire after consulting with the former Portugal international's wife Rute Cardoso and family members.

Odegaard Arsenal captain in vote by '100 miles' - Arteta,"Manager Mikel Arteta says Martin Odegaard was the overwhelming choice of players and staff to remain Arsenal captain this season, despite criticism from club legend Tony Adams.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn72kl1my7yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:42:32",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Manager Mikel Arteta says Martin Odegaard was the overwhelming choice of players and staff to remain Arsenal captain this season, despite criticism from club legend Tony Adams.
Former skipper Adams led the Gunners to four top-flight titles during his 19-year career.
And he insisted England midfielder Declan Rice, 26, should take the armband this season to give them a better chance of winning the Premier League for the first time since 2004.
However, Arteta revealed Norwegian Odegaard, 26, was the unanimous choice after he held a vote on the captaincy.
""Well my opinion is clear and it's not just my opinion, it's all the staff and especially the players."" said the Arsenal boss.
""I asked them to vote the captain and I got the result yesterday. And by a mile, by a big, big 100 miles, everybody choosing the same person, which is Martin Odegaard, and which is the most clear sign that you can have.
""It's how they feel about who has to be their captain to defend, improve and win the matches that we want to win. So I think there's no question about that.""
Midfielder Odegaard has been Arsenal captain since 2022, but his side have not managed to win a trophy during that time, finishing second in the last three league campaigns.
The Gunners have spent around £190m this summer as they look to land a major trophy for the first time since they lifted the FA Cup in 2020 during Arteta's first season in charge.
One of the key signings was £64m striker Viktor Gyokeres.
The Gunners hope his goals will make the crucial difference this term and Arteta said they are working hard to bring out the best in the 27-year-old Swede following his protracted arrival from Sporting.
""Well, we're going to do everything,"" added the Spaniard, who will also have £60m midfielder Martin Zubimendi fit for Arsenal's visit to Manchester United on Sunday in their first game of the season.
""First of all, understanding the player and exposing the player to the conditions that he can fulfil his incredible potential.
""That's going to be the key and the good thing is that there have been many players, many strikers, they have come from different leagues, they have come to the Premier League and been successful.
""And it's for us creating the right context for Viktor to do what he does the best, which is to score goals.""

Maresca at odds with Chelsea over Colwill replacement,"Enzo Maresca wants Chelsea to sign a new central defender to replace the injured Levi Colwill - but the club continues to seek an ""internal solution"".",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx23l9k9vjvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 11:12:03",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Enzo Maresca says he has told Chelsea he wants to sign a new central defender to replace the injured Levi Colwill - but the club continues to seek an ""internal solution"".
England international Colwill has had surgery on an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and is expected to miss most of the season.
The 22-year-old was a near ever-present for Chelsea last season in the Premier League, starting 35 of their 38 matches as they qualified for the Champions League.
When asked what he thought was the solution to replacing Colwill in his squad, Maresca said: ""The club know exactly what I think.
""I think we need a central defender. We are looking for an internal solution but as I said, the club know exactly what I think.""
In addition to his Premier League contribution last season, Colwill played a major role as a substitute in the Conference League final and during the Club World Cup as the Blues won their first two major trophies under the current ownership.
His presence is key tactically, more than defensively but, crucially, Maresca believes that Colwill is his best central defender at build-up play from the back.
""When we build, we build with Levi in the middle,"" said Maresca.
""Last year we played 64 games and we played all 64 games with either Levi or Tosin [Adarabioyo in the middle].
""Now Levi is out. The only other one that he can do that job well is Tosin. But we have Premier League, Champions League, with these kind of players.
""The rest, they can adapt. [Jorrel] Hato is a new one, he never played as the guy in the middle last season [with Ajax], so it's not about being a central defender.
""Yes, [he is a] central defender but can he do that? It's different. Also we have players that unfortunately, like Wes [Fofana] or Benoit [Badiashile], they have in this moment some [injury] problems.
""The one in the middle in my way is so, so, so important. And this is the reason why I said that the club knows exactly what I think about central defenders.""
Josh Acheampong and Trevoh Chalobah having been trialled in Colwill's role in wins over Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan during a short two-week pre-season.
When asked specifically whether France centre-back Fofana, who is set to return against Palace on Sunday, could step up, Maresca explained: ""He can do but he needs to be fit first of all.
""He played 45 minutes in that position and it was the first half against Bournemouth away, if you remember.
""Probably one of the worst, worst halves since we started. And Benoit playing in the middle, Conference League final, first half. We were losing 1-0. Then we changed with Levi and we won 4-1, so it's not the same [as Colwill].""
Chelsea are known to admire Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi - who is is a target for champions Liverpool - but they are currently planning to strengthen their attacking options in the final two weeks of the transfer window, amid talks with Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig midfielder Xavi Simons.
Does Maresca already have what he needs?
So what do the statistics say about Colwill compared to the other defensive options Maresca has at his disposal?
At first glance it looks like Colwill's numbers are superior to his rivals having registered the most progressive passes (98), passes under high pressure (817), line breaking passes (350) and chances created (14) in the Premier League last season.
However, he achieves those numbers having simply started more games and, when adjusted on a per game basis in league matches, the picture suddenly favours the club's view.
For example, Adarabioyo and Acheampong are marginally better, achieving one more pass (24) under high pressure than Colwill.
Apart from Fofana and Chalobah, all the alternative options are better than Colwill with progressive passes. Fofana is slightly better when it comes to his 0.46 chances created when compared with his partner's 0.40.
In terms of line breaking passes, Colwill is second with 10 behind Benoit Badiashile's 13.8 per game. In addition, the data doesn't take into account Jorrel Hato, a £37m summer signing from Dutch club Ajax.
There may be intangible elements that are difficult to reflect with data, like Colwill's season on loan under Roberto De Zerbi at Brighton - a coach Maresca regards as one of the best in Europe - while he is also internally regarded as a leader.
Those are difficult to define with statistics but data seems to show the defender can be replaced from within.

Liverpool sign teenager Leoni from Parma for £26m,Liverpool sign centre-back Giovanni Leoni from Italian side Parma for £26m on a deal until 2031.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9d09y292jeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 16:55:18",Adam Millington,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have signed 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from Italian side Parma for a fee of £26m plus add-ons.
Leoni, who Reds boss Arne Slot confirmed the club had agreed a deal for earlier this week, has signed a contract until 2031.
The Italy Under-19s centre-back began his career at Padova and had a short spell at Sampdoria before joining Parma last summer.
Leoni played 17 games in his first campaign in Serie A last season, attracting interest from both Milan clubs, but has opted for a move abroad.
He said it was ""not possible to say no"" to Liverpool.
""Because it's one of the best clubs in the world. It's not possible to say no to this club,"" he told the club website.
""[It was] easy - because it's one of the best clubs in the world. I didn't say no.""
Leoni's transfer is subject to receiving international clearance and a work permit.
Leoni's rise set to continue at Liverpool - Analysis
Giovanni Leoni only made his senior debut in 2023, playing in the Italian third tier for Padova as a 16-year-old, but just two years later he has joined the Premier League champions.
Liverpool have been looking for reinforcements in central defence since selling Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen last month, and although Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi remains very much in their sights, Leoni would provide extra cover in an area where the Reds are potentially light.
After all, captain Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate were their only fit senior central defenders for the Community Shield.
With Van Dijk now 34, Liverpool need to have an eye on the future. Eighteen-year-old Leoni certainly ticks that box but also looks ready now, despite only establishing himself in Parma's starting line-up in the second half of last season.
With just 14 top-flight starts under his belt, he has not played as much as fellow highly rated teenage centre-backs Pau Cubarsi at Barcelona, Mamadou Sarr at Strasbourg or Real Madrid's Dean Huijsen, but his stats are impressive.
At 6ft 5in (1.96m) he is exceptional in the air, ranking in the top 10% for aerial duels won in Serie A last season.
At Parma, Leoni played in the middle of the back three or as the right centre-back and, as well as his aerial strength, he is also composed in possession, especially given his lack of experience.
He will probably have to be patient for his chances. But the opportunity to develop his game with the Premier League champions and learn from Van Dijk, who he has previously called his inspiration, appears to have helped clinch the move.

Bournemouth in talks to sign Liverpool winger Doak,"Bournemouth open talks to sign Scotland winger Ben Doak from Liverpool, who want £25m for the 19-year-old.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c939d33pxnxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:54:17",Nizaar Kinsella,['Liverpool'],"Bournemouth have opened talks to sign Scotland winger Ben Doak from Liverpool.
The Reds want £25m for the 19-year-old, who is expected to be left out of their squad for Friday's Premier League season opener against Bournemouth.
Doak has been a target for other Premier League clubs and Portuguese side Porto, but the Cherries are considered the frontrunners to sign him, according to multiple sources involved in the deal.
The forward, who has six caps for Scotland, spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, scoring three times and recording seven assists in 24 matches.
He has played just 10 times for Liverpool since joining from Celtic in 2022.
Bournemouth, who have agreed to sell Dango Ouattara to Brentford for £42.5m,  are keen to reduce the price for Doak in negotiations.
It has been a busy summer for the Cherries after losing defenders Illia Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez for a total of about £150m.
Manager Andoni Iraola admitted his side are ""not where they want to be"" before the trip to Anfield but added ""important movements"" will be made before the transfer window closes on 1 September.
Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, left-back Adrien Truffert and centre-back Bafode Diakite have joined Bournemouth this summer, with January signing Eli Junior Kroupi also coming into the squad after finishing last season on loan at Lorient.
