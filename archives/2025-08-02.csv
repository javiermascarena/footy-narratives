Spurs captain Son to leave club this summer,Tottenham&#160;captain&#160;Heung-Min Son&#160;has announced he will be leaving the club this summer.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13405450/heung-min-son-tottenham-hotspur-captain-to-leave-spurs-this-summer-after-ten-years-and-wants-to-join-mls,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 06:45:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham captain Heung-Min Son has announced he will be leaving the club this summer.
The forward announced his decision in a press conference ahead of Spurs' pre-season friendly against Newcastle in the player's native South Korea on Sunday - which could be his final game for the club.
Spurs head coach Thomas Frank has confirmed that Son will start and captain the team on Sunday.
Son wants to move to Major League Soccer despite renewed interest from Saudi Arabia. The MLS and LAFC, who have been strongly linked to the player, will now accelerate talks with Spurs over Son's transfer.
""I have decided to leave the club this summer. Respectfully the club is helping me with this decision,"" said an emotional Son.
""It was the most difficult decision I have made in my career. Such amazing memories. It was so hard to make the decision.
""I need a new environment to push myself. I need a little bit of change - 10 years is a long time. I came to north London as a kid, 23 years old, such a young age. I leave this club as a grown man, a very proud man.
""I want to say thank you to all the Spurs fans for giving me so much love. I hope the goodbye is also good timing and this is the right time to make that decision. I hope everyone can accept that and respect that.""
Son confirmed that he had made his decision to leave a while ago but only told a few players. New Spurs boss Frank knew of Son's decision ahead of their first pre-season game at Reading earlier this month.
Son is fourth on the list of Spurs' all-time record goalscorers - behind only Harry Kane, Jimmy Greaves and Bobby Smith.
Son has 173 goals and 101 assists for Spurs in all competitions, including 127 goals and 27 assists in 333 matches in the Premier League.
The 33-year-old's last competitive game for the club is set to be the Europa League final win over Manchester United in Bilbao last season.
The winger was a second-half substitute in that match and lifted the trophy after full-time - Spurs' first major honour since 2008.
Cristian Romero - who was linked with a move away from Spurs himself this summer - is likely to be the new captain of the north London club.
Speaking in the same press conference, new Spurs head coach Frank described Son as the one of the best Premier League wingers there has ever been.
""For me personally, I would love to work with him. He is a fantastic person and player. I've had the opportunity to watch him from a distance,"" said the Dane.
""He has been here 10 years at Spurs, not just 10 years but 10 amazing years. He is a truly Spurs legend in every aspect. I actually think one of the best players who has ever played in the Premier League as a winger in my opinion.
""I like the club has been open to it because it is never easy to find that perfect timing and me coming in a little bit from the side I think it's probably the perfect timing going out on a high.
""He's been here for 10 years, won a well deserved trophy. Been a key player for many seasons. It's almost the perfect ending to a happy family.
""I think it's very clear. It's no secret that Sonny will start and will lead the team out as captain. So I'm looking forward to that in many ways and if it is to be the last game for Sonny, what a place to do it in South Korea, his home country in front of his home fans.
""That could potentially be a beautiful ending. First and foremost with the biggest respect to Sonny and what he's done for the club.""
Frank was also asked on how Spurs move on from Son - with the north London club still active in the transfer market.
While Spurs have the option to buy a new wide player to replace Son, Frank talked up the options already at the club.
""First and foremost, when a great player is leaving a team other players have a chance to shine,"" said Frank.
""Brennan Johnson is a player who could play on the left. Also I think that Wilson Odobert did well against Arsenal and can play on the left and also Mathys Tel is a flexible player.
""I think we have some young promising players that hopefully can step up and take over from Sonny in the future.""
Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:
Heung-Min Son will go down as one of Tottenham Hotspur's standout players of the modern era. There is even a fair argument to say he is the standalone Spurs icon of this generation.
Harry Kane may be Spurs' all-time record goalscorer, but Son will always be remembered as the one who stayed.
Kane gave Spurs fans more goalscoring moments down the years but Son holds just one moment - the trophy lift in Bilbao - which stands above all in terms of Spurs' recent history.
And it is worth remembering that many of Kane's goals came from Son's assists. Statistically speaking, Son was one half of the deadliest striker partnership in Premier League history.
Son and Kane set each other up 47 times across 229 games together - no Premier League pair has managed more. The 2020/21 campaign was the highlight of their partnership, with their 14 assists for goals between them the most in a single season.
Thomas Frank described the South Korean as one of the greatest Premier League wingers of all time and his numbers are definitely up there.
Not only is he fourth on Spurs' all-time top goalscorers list but he is 16th on the Premier League's scorers chart - and one of only 34 players to be in the Premier League 100 goals club.
Since his Premier League debut, only Mohamed Salah has more goal contributions. Son even has more than Kevin de Bruyne in that time, despite the Belgian joining Manchester City in the same summer that Son arrived at Spurs.
All that plus a lovable character that even rivals fans could not argue against, it highlights that Son is not just a Spurs legend, but a Premier League one too.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Newcastle braced for second Isak bid after rejecting Liverpool offer,Newcastle are braced for a second offer from Liverpool for striker Alexander Isak after seeing their first bid rejected.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13405060/alexander-isak-transfer-news-newcastle-reject-liverpool-bid-of-over-100m-with-striker-keen-to-explore-options,"Fri, 01 Aug 2025 14:00:00",,['Liverpool'],"Newcastle are braced for a second offer from Liverpool for striker Alexander Isak after seeing their first bid rejected.
Sky Sports News understands Liverpool's opening offer for Isak was £110m plus add-ons. However, the total offer did not reach £120m.
Newcastle do not want to sell, and value Isak at £150m.
Head coach Eddie Howe confirmed the club have turned down a bid from Liverpool for Isak, but is unsure on what will happen next.
""I am very much removed from anything that's happening back home,"" Howe said in a press conference ahead of Newcastle's match against Tottenham Hotspur in South Korea on Sunday.
""I was made aware that there was a bid [on Friday] - that bid was turned down all before I even heard about it. There's people back in England dealing with the situation.
""I really don't know what's going to happen next, but from our perspective we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.""
The Sweden international is training alone at his former club Real Sociedad's training facilities amid uncertainty over his Newcastle future.
It is understood Newcastle are aware of Isak's whereabouts as he recovers from the ""minor thigh injury"" that the club say has kept him from travelling to Singapore for their pre-season tour, with the player expected back in the north east next week.
However, Howe revealed that he himself only found out about Isak's whereabouts through the media and not from the player himself.
""I know where he is now - through the media,"" said Howe. ""So I think from that perspective, it is difficult to go into any type of detail.""
The 25-year-old has informed Newcastle that he wants to explore his options in this transfer window after Liverpool previously made an informal approach for him.
Liverpool play at Newcastle in the Premier League - live on Sky Sports - on August 25 on Monday Night Football.
Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
""The figure does not meet Newcastle's valuation, they don't want to sell the player and they are yet to bring in a replacement.
""This is not the last we are going to hear of this story. Newcastle are looking to bring in a top-level replacement. They need to have assurances that they will get a player in. They don't want to leave themselves in a position where they have no strikers. All they would be left with is young Will Osula.
""Next week will be so interesting. Newcastle and Isak return on Monday and it will be interesting to see if Liverpool return with a second offer. Personal terms would not be a problem. It could be done next week. I don't see it dragging on until the end of the transfer window.
""It's a huge transfer and would be a Premier League record. I think if it is to happen, it will happen within the next week or 10 days. The longer it goes on, the less likely it is to be done.""
Sky Sports Data Editor Adam Smith:
Alexander Isak scored 23 goals in the Premier League last season - second only to Mohamed Salah.
The Sweden international also outperformed his expected goals (20.42), underlining his elite-level finishing and composure in front of goal.
The 25-year-old consistently finds space around the penalty spot, where he converts a high proportion of his shots. But he's far more than a poacher: six of his 36 efforts from outside the box found the net - demonstrating his range and technique.
The chart below benchmarks Isak's per-90 stats against other strikers in Europe's top five leagues. He excels across a wide spectrum - from goalscoring and dribbling, to opposition-box entries and link-up play.
Howe added that Newcastle are only ""looking for the best"" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.
Not only have the Magpies been hit with Isak's desire to leave, but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Ekitike and James Trafford.
Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Brentford forward Yoane Wissa. With Callum Wilson departing earlier this summer, it leaves just Will Osula as their only recognised first-team striker on their pre-season tour of Asia.
""We're looking for the best players that we can get,"" said Howe. ""Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us.
""I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.
""It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change til the window shuts.""

Donnarumma has entered the final year of his contract and PSG are close to signing a new 'keeper in Lille's Lucas Chevalier.
The Italy international is in no rush to make a decision over his future and is willing to compete with Chevalier for the No 1 spot.
It is still a possibility that he stays with the Champions League winners beyond this summer.
However, United's interest throws the future of Andre Onana into doubt.
The Cameroon international is with the squad in the United States, but is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury.
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
""Gianluigi Donnarumma would be a massive signing for Man Utd - both literally and figuratively.
""The 6ft5in Italy shot-stopper is an enormous presence in the goalmouth and is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the business.
""It feels like Donnarumma went to even greater heights last season, playing a crucial role in Paris St-Germain's incredible season.
""Commanding in Ligue 1, a shoot-out star against Liverpool in the Champions League and formidable with five clean sheets in eight games at the Club World Cup, Donnarumma would be a huge coup for United if they could get a deal done.
""Andre Onana has been in the spotlight since he had that let-off against Wolves in his Premier League debut and uncertainty about the current United keeper has fed the nervousness and lack of conviction about Ruben Amorim's backline.
""His total of eight errors leading to goals since the start of 2023/24 is more than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League. Donnarumma would be a substantial upgrade.""

'A true Spurs legend' - Son to leave Tottenham after 10 years,Tottenham captain Son Heung-min says he will leave the club this summer after 10 years.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg0pee5l05o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 06:49:34",Ben Ramsdale,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham captain Son Heung-min says he will leave the club this summer after 10 years.
The South Korea international joined Spurs from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015 and has scored 173 goals in 454 appearances.
He was captain when Tottenham beat Manchester United in the Europa League final in May to clinch their first trophy in 17 years.
The 33-year-old, who is under contract with Spurs until 2026, is in advanced negotiations with Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC.
Son described the decision as ""the most difficult one I have made in my career"" as he spoke to media alongside new manager Thomas Frank.
""I came to north London as a kid - a very young age, a young boy came to London who even didn't speak English,"" Son said.
""Leaving this club as a grown man is a very, very proud moment.""
Tottenham are in Seoul as part of their pre-season preparations, with Son set to start and skipper the side against Newcastle in their friendly on Sunday - meaning his final appearance for the club could come in his home country.
Frank, who replaced Ange Postecoglou as head coach in June, described Son as ""a true Spurs legend"" and ""one of the greatest players to play in the Premier League"".
""If that is the last game for Sonny, what a place to do it here in front of his home fans,"" Frank said.
""It could be a beautiful ending.""
Tottenham also face Paris St-Germain in the Uefa Super Cup on 13 August, but Son may depart by then.
'I need new environment to push myself'
Son said winning a title in Europe with Spurs ""felt like I had achieved everything I possibly could"".
He made his Tottenham debut in September 2015 and went on to make 333 Premier League appearances.
He scored 127 times in the league - level with former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink at 16th in the league's all-time scorers list, above the likes of Dwight Yorke, Steven Gerrard and Ian Wright.
Son formed a memorable attacking partnership with Harry Kane, now at Bayern Munich, and the pair hold the record for the most goal combinations in the Premier League.
The pair registered a record 47 combinations, Son scoring 24 goals to Kane's 23. In a prolific two-season period - 2020-21 and 2021-22 - they linked up 21 times for goals.
Son became the first Asian player to win the Premier League golden boot, sharing the title with Liverpool's Mohamed Salah with 23 goals in the 2021-22 season, and a year later was the first from the continent to reach 100 Premier League goals.
He featured in the Champions League final against Liverpool in 2019 - which the Reds won 2-0 - and took over as club captain from Hugo Lloris in August 2023.
""I need a new environment to push myself. I need a little bit of change - 10 years is a long time,"" Son added.
""I spent a lot of time reflecting on whether I wanted to experience football in a different environment, and I had those conversations with myself over and over again.""
Son also provided 101 assists in all competitions and holds Spurs' record for Premier League assists with 71.
He has also made the sixth-most appearances in the history of the club - behind only Cyril Knowles, Pat Jennings, Gary Mabbutt, Steve Perryman and Glenn Hoddle.

A broad agreement has been reached between the clubs but the 23-year-old is yet to green light the move himself, with a five-year deal on the table.
Broja is keen on a move to Turf Moor but the move is not expected to go through until early next week.
Sources say the move could be worth up to £20m but the exact price has not been confirmed.
Broja joined the Chelsea academy in 2009 and signed his first professional deal with them in 2020.
He has made 38 appearances for the senior team, having had loan stints with Vitesse, Southampton, Fulham and Everton.
He scored his first goal for Chelsea in October 2022 but was subsequently ruled out of the rest of the season after suffering a knee injury in a friendly against Aston Villa a few months later.

Liverpool may not pursue Isak deal after Newcastle reject bid,Liverpool could walk away from a move for Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak after their opening £110m offer was rejected.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5yl7epeyv0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 01 Aug 2025 16:03:37",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool claim they are willing to walk away from a move for striker Alexander Isak after Newcastle United rejected their opening offer.
The Magpies, who value the Sweden international at about £150m, turned down a bid of £110m from the Premier League champions.
BBC Sport understands Liverpool do not think a deal for Isak is achievable this summer as it stands.
It is unclear whether this is a negotiating tactic and if Liverpool will maintain that stance.
The 25-year-old was left out of the Newcastle squad for their pre-season tour of Asia with a ""minor thigh injury"", according to the club, while he wants to explore a move away despite the Magpies qualifying for this season's Champions League.
The bid from Liverpool was lodged while Isak trains alone at former club Real Sociedad, amid continued uncertainty around his future.
He joined Newcastle in a £60m move from La Liga side Real Sociedad in 2022.
BBC Sport reported in July how Liverpool were considering a deal for Isak worth up to £130m.
Newcastle have maintained he is not for sale this summer, but that has not prevented Arne Slot's side from taking a major interest.
The Premier League champions made an approach to Newcastle last month before lodging an official bid.
Boss Slot has already made a number of additions to his squad during a heavy summer of spending by the Anfield club.
They have signed Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong, Giorgi Mamardashvili and Armin Pecsi for a combined total of about £265m without add-ons.
Meanwhile, the departures of Luis Diaz, Jarell Quansah, Caoimhin Kelleher and Trent Alexander-Arnold have recouped an initial £115m.

'A damaged relationship' - how Isak saga could unfold,"With Liverpool having a bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle, how could the saga over the Swedish striker's future end?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cde37yrn8j9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:56:14",Gary Rose,['Liverpool'],"As the new Premier League season draws closer, the uncertainty over Alexander Isak's future has intensified.
Newcastle begin their campaign away to Aston Villa on 16 August but they appear far from ready with just one player - Anthony Elanga - signed this summer and their talismanic striker seemingly determined to leave the club.
With his team-mates away on a pre-season tour in Asia, Isak has been training at his old club Real Sociedad as he recovers from a ""minor thigh injury"".
Should he leave, Newcastle will rightly be expecting a significant fee for a player who has scored more than 20 Premier League goals in each of the last two seasons.
But, having just rejected a bid from Liverpool, what happens if Isak starts the season at St James' Park?
'Newcastle's best striker since Shearer'
When Isak joined Newcastle in a deal worth £60m from Real Sociedad three years ago he said one of the reasons he moved was because he believed in their project.
Part of that will have been to secure a return to European football, which they did in his debut season as he scored 10 goals in 27 games to help them finish fourth in the Premier League.
Isak followed that with 21 league goals in 2023-24 and 23 last season, helping the club book a return to the Champions League, while also scoring the decisive goal in the League Cup final as Newcastle ended their 70-year wait for domestic silverware.
Since joining Newcastle only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (84) and Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah (65) have scored more goals in the Premier League than Isak's total of 50.
The Sweden international's numbers over the last couple of seasons has him rubbing shoulders with some of Europe's leading marksmen over the same period.
Isak outperformed his xG by 3.3 during this spell, with his 44 strikes coming from an expected goals of 40.7.
""Isak is Newcastle's best striker since Alan Shearer,"" said Matthew Raisbeck, who covers the club for BBC Radio Newcastle.
""He is the player who scored the decisive goal at Wembley - one of many special moments in black and white - and he was worshipped on Tyneside.
""But that relationship has been damaged.""
'Summer turning into a bit of a nightmare'
The noises from Newcastle themselves do not suggest Isak has no future at the club - should a move elsewhere fail to materialise.
The expectation is the 25-year-old will return to training with his team-mates from next week.
""He is still our player,"" said manager Eddie Howe.
""He's contracted to us. We, to a degree, control what is next for him.
""I would love to believe all possibilities are still available to us. My wish is that he stays, but that's not in my full control.
""My wish is that he stays and we see him playing again next year.""
That's the club's stance - but the supporters may feel a little differently.
Isak has rightly been idolised for his goals, but his desire to leave is a frustration for some.
""We've just had an amazing season, in which we won our first trophy in 70 years, and he helped us win that,"" said Lee Johnson from the Newcastle podcast True Faith.
""The hope was that this summer would have been a transformation for ourselves but it seems to be turning into a bit of a nightmare now.""
Former Newcastle defender Steve Howey added: ""He's at a club who absolutely adore him. He'll be on unbelievable money, they've won something and they're in the Champions League - it would have to be some club to want to leave for.
""He has been looked after very well by Newcastle, has three years left on his contract and we're open to giving him a pay rise, but for him to have his head turned is just disappointing at this stage.
""You have to agree with the fans' frustration because you have the nucleus of a very good team.""
'Catastrophic' if he leaves
Isak's goals alone have been worth 30 points to Newcastle since he joined, and that contribution will be difficult to replace.
A number of forwards have been identified to fill the void with Brentford's Yoane Wissa and RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko both targets.
Wissa scored 19 goals in the Premier League last season, while Sesko hit 13 in the Bundesliga and 21 in 45 games across all competitions.
They are quality players but, for a number of reasons, movement in the transfer market for Newcastle this summer has been slow and frustrating.
The club are without a director of football or chief executive, which will have impacted their ability to do business, while keeping within Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) has meant they have been unable to spend big in recent seasons.
One positive of a big-money move for Isak - with a fee of around £150m being suggested - would give Newcastle the flexibility to make some top-class additions.
But the timing of any departure is going to be key.
""There is an acceptance Newcastle need to become better at selling players,"" admitted Raisbeck.
""It's something former sporting director Paul Mitchell alluded to last year to when he described their transfer strategy prior to his arrival as ""not fit for purpose.
""It is the first time since the takeover in October 2021 another club has come for one of their big names.
""Many fans are worried about the impact on the dressing room and fear others will see a move away from St James' Park as the best thing for their careers.
""The ownership have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in Newcastle over the last four years and the message is that they remain committed to taking the club to the top.
""The Isak money, should they sell, will boost their PSR position and hopefully enable them to add more depth and quality to their squad - something they have really struggled to do in this transfer window.""
Supporter and True Faith podcaster Charlotte Robson added: ""Make no mistake: losing Isak without a replacement ready would be catastrophic for Newcastle United.
""I don't think it is controversial to say it is going to be very difficult to progress in the Champions League without a striker in the squad.""
'With Howe in charge, anything is possible'
Should Newcastle resist a sale, they would retain a player who is arguably one of the world's best strikers.
""I think he might [start the season at Newcastle] but I don't think he will play,"" supporter Morris told BBC Radio Newcastle.
""But if Eddie Howe put him on the pitch he would still give his all.
""He scores all sorts of goals, he is the best striker we've had since Alan Shearer.""
""I love watching him,"" added former Newcastle defender John Anderson.
""He is a top player who scores goals and creates goals, and frightens the life out of defenders.""
Stay or go, the saga of Isak's future has undoubtedly hampered Newcastle's preparations for the new campaign.
But whatever happens, it doesn't necessarily mean the club will be in for a difficult season.
""It has certainly been a tough few months,"" added Raisbeck.
""But, they were in a difficult place 12 months ago with PSR pressures, changes at executive level, and speculation about the manager's future. What followed was the most successful season the club has had.
""With Eddie Howe in charge and some outstanding players in his squad, anything is possible.""
'Next level' or 'greedy' signing? Do Liverpool need Isak?
Should he go, a move to Premier League champions Liverpool seems the most likely.
The Reds are investing heavily as they look to push on next season, and see Isak as the man to lead their frontline.
But Liverpool fans appear torn.
""Let's be honest, this is just us being greedy,"" said supporter Callum.
""He would be a great addition to the squad - any team would happily take him - but we just have so much threat in the attack that we simply don't need him to the point of spending more than £100m.""
Fellow fan Michael believes there are other priorities within the team.
""It's getting silly this,"" he added. ""If there are funds to spend get a centre-back - that's the cover we need. We do not need another forward. Just because there's money, it doesn't mean we must spend it.""
But fellow Liverpool fan Simon said: ""If Isak is available and Liverpool can afford him, then go for it.
""This will take Liverpool to the same level that Manchester City have been at for the past few seasons.
""When you are champions, you make your team better. All the great teams do the same.""

Ineos carer facing doping probe worked at Man Utd,The Ineos Grenadiers staff member who is due to speak to the International Testing Agency about doping allegations relating to the 2012 season worked at Manchester United last year.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c860wzd5178o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:57:53",Dan Roan,['Manchester United'],"The Ineos Grenadiers staff member who left the Tour de France after being asked to speak to the International Testing Agency (ITA) about doping allegations relating to the 2012 season worked at Manchester United last year.
The cycling team confirmed David Rozman had received an interview request from the ITA after initially being contacted in April, and ""stepped back"" from Tour duties last month.
The Slovenian is one of Ineos' soigneurs, a role that involves working as an assistant to riders and providing a range of services from logistics to massages.
It has now emerged Rozman worked alongside United's soft tissue therapists for a one month placement in 2024 as part of a 'knowledge exchange' after Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe became co-owner of the club.
BBC Sport has been told United had no knowledge of the recently published historic allegations and insiders claim they have no involvement in them.
United declined to comment. Ineos have been approached for comment.
Ineos Grenadiers, then known as Team Sky, won the 2012 Tour de France, with Britain's Bradley Wiggins claiming the yellow jersey, and the team went on to win six of the next seven editions of the race.
The cycling team has confirmed that Rozman was informally contacted in April 2025 by a member of ITA staff, who asked him about alleged historical communications, claiming that it then commissioned a review by an external law firm.
In a statement at the time it said: ""The team has acted responsibly and with due process, taking the allegations seriously whilst acknowledging that David is a long-standing, dedicated member of the team.
""The team continues to assess the circumstances and any relevant developments, and has formally requested any relevant information from the ITA. To date the team has received no evidence from any relevant authority.
""Both David and the team will of course co-operate with the ITA and any other authority.""
Earlier in July, the Irish Independent reported that in 2012, Rozman had exchanged messages with convicted German doping doctor Mark Schmidt.
A documentary by German TV company ARD also linked Ineos to Schmidt but did not name the staff member involved.
In 2021, Schmidt was sentenced to four years and 10 months in jail after being convicted of administering illegal blood transfusions to athletes within cycling and a number of other sports as part of Operation Aderlass.
When contacted by BBC Sport, the ITA said its investigations are ""conducted confidentially"" and ""outcomes may only be shared if and when it yields the pursuit of one or more anti-doping rule violations.""
Ineos have shared knowledge and staff between different parts of their sporting portfolio.
In June, Ineos director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford scaled back his involvement with Manchester United, having previously played a integral role in football operations.
Brailsford stepped down as team principal of Ineos Grenadiers after Ratcliffe acquired his stake in United but has returned to a key position at the cycling team and was present at this year's Tour de France.

Son Heung-min announces departure from Tottenham as he seeks ‘bit of change’ after decade at club,Spurs captain reveals intention to leave this summer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/02/son-heung-min-announces-departure-from-tottenham-as-he-seeks-bit-of-change-after-decade-at-club,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 03:38:52",Tottenham Hotspur,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"The Tottenham captain Son Heung-min has revealed he intends to leave the club this summer after a decade in north London.
The 33-year-old forward joined the Premier League side from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015 and went on to play more than 450 times for Spurs. In May he lifted the Europa League trophy but he had a poor season overall by his high standards and struggled with injury.
“Before we start the press conference I wanted to say I have decided to leave the club this summer,” the South Korean told reporters on Saturday in Seoul, where Tottenham are on a pre-season tour. “Respectfully the club is helping me with this decision.”
Son, who has scored 173 goals for Spurs, did not say where he intends to go next and cut an emotional figure. “It was the most difficult decision I have made in my career. Such amazing memories. It was so hard to make the decision,” he said, flanked by the new Tottenham manager, Thomas Frank.
“I need a new environment to push myself. I need a little bit of change – 10 years is a long time. I came to north London as a kid, 23 years old, such a young age. I leave this club as a grown man, a very proud man.”
Speaking in Korean, Son said that winning a European trophy – Tottenham’s first European crown in 41 years – played “a big part” in his thinking. “Winning a title in Europe felt like I had achieved everything I possibly could,” he said. “I spent a lot of time reflecting on whether I wanted to experience football in a different environment, and I had those conversations with myself over and over again.”
Frank, who joined Spurs from Brentford this summer, paid tribute to Son. “For me, personally, I would have loved to have worked with this fantastic person and player,” said the Dane, who took over from the sacked Ange Postecoglou.
“He is a true Spurs legend in every aspect, one of the greatest players to play in the Premier League. It is never easy to find the perfect timing and me coming in from the side, it makes it a bit easier to end on a high.”
Spurs will face Newcastle on Sunday in Seoul, and Son is guaranteed a rapturous reception in front of his home fans. It could be Son’s final appearance for Spurs, despite the Uefa Super Cup fixture with Paris Saint-Germain in Udine on 13 August.
Frank said: “It’s very clear that Sonny will start and lead the team out as captain. If that is the last game for Sonny, what a place to do it here in front of his home fans. It could be a beautiful ending.”

Newcastle’s Eddie Howe admits ‘complex’ Isak situation is ‘far from ideal’,Liverpool willing to walk away after £110m bid for Swede,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/02/newcastle-eddie-howe-alexander-isak-liverpool-transfer-football,"Sat, 02 Aug 2025 07:50:37",Transfer window,['Liverpool'],"Eddie Howe has admitted that the Alexander Isak situation is “far from ideal”, but still hopes to see the unsettled player back in a Newcastle shirt after confirming the club rejected an offer from Liverpool.
The 25-year-old Swede, one of the hottest properties in world football, has had his head turned by the Premier League champions’ interest this summer. Isak did not travel to Asia for Newcastle’s pre-season tour due to what the club called a “minor thigh injury”, only for his unhappiness to emerge along with the fact he is training at his former club Real Sociedad.
On Friday, Liverpool submitted a £110m bid but, after that was turned down, have intimated they do not intend to submit a second offer in this transfer window.
“I think from my situation, I am very much removed from everything that is happening back home,” Howe said, as reported by The Athletic. “I was made aware there was a bid yesterday. That bid was turned down before I heard about it.
“There are people back in England dealing with the situation. I really don’t know what is going to happen next, but from our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.”
Newcastle head back from Asia after Sunday’s friendly against Tottenham in Seoul, where Howe revealed he learned Isak was training in Spain through the media.
“I know where he is through the media, so I think from that perspective it’s difficult for me to go into any detail,” the said. “The situation is far from ideal. It is quite complex. I think that is all I have got to say.”

Newport’s David Hughes: ‘Let’s not look over the fence at what other people have’,"After three years at Manchester United’s academy, 47-year-old is adapting to life as a League Two manager",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/01/newport-county-manager-david-hughes-interview,"Fri, 01 Aug 2025 11:14:17",Ben Fisher,['Manchester United'],"‘I don’t want to name- drop,” says David Hughes, the Newport County manager, mindful of his reply to a question about the coaches who have shaped his career to this point, and whether he canvassed their opinion before taking the job this summer. The 47-year-old has spent the past three seasons at Manchester United, in an instrumental academy role as a development-phase coach, and prior to that worked at Aston Villa, Cardiff, clubs for whom he also played, and Southampton. This may be his first real shot at frontline management – aside from a few months in charge of Barry Town more than two decades ago – but he is anything but inexperienced.
The close season always brings change but it is hard to imagine a starker shift than Hughes swapping a global institution for Newport, with one of the smallest budgets in League Two. He has added two performance analysts to his team but it is a skeleton operation compared to United’s academy structure, where he worked closely with Nick Cox, who is moving to Everton as their technical director. “Big, big clubs have huge numbers of staff, different levels of responsibility and accountability,” Hughes says. “But we’re really pleased with our small staff. We came back for pre-season and the goals were green from last season, so we went out as staff cleaning the goalposts and I’m thinking: ‘We’ve got a team here.’ Everybody’s prepared to muck in.”
Hughes, who was born in Wrexham, calls south Wales home and acknowledges Newport has never really been a place for bells and whistles. “Supporters expect to see some sweat on the shirt,” he says. “They expect to see positive body language: don’t throw your arms in the air, get on with it. Let’s not carry anyone. Supporters will definitely forgive a mistake if there’s a willingness and intent to press and engage and get after the ball and force mistakes and errors into your opponents.”
Did Hughes anticipate the opportunity to manage a senior team? “It’s a good question,” he says. “Did I think it would come? I suppose the older you get, possibly not.” His time at United, where he coached academy players on the pitch next to the one used by the first team, only enhanced his education. “In your first week or two, you go round Old Trafford, the Munich [memorial], the museum and see the history and heritage that’s attached to the club, and the individuals that have come through, and there is a responsibility. It’s just the most fascinating, incredible place. I don’t think there’s another place like it. In my eyes, it’s the pinnacle of youth development.”
Hughes tackles the sniffy perception of managers born in academy coaching. “Like it’s a bad thing,” he says. “I’m not sure there’s anything to be ashamed of in trying to help people evolve and improve. That’s commendable, right? And I would imagine every manager is trying to help their players develop and evolve to help them win. I’m quite proud of the fact that I’ve supported people to become successful … it definitely wasn’t down to me, it was down to them. And so that’s what we’re trying to do here. We’re trying to help the team become successful.” He insists there are many similarities between the roles. “What’s different now is ‘Saturday’, I guess,” he says.
This Saturday Newport host Notts County, who also have a new manager in Martin Paterson. Talking on a bench outside Newport’s training base at the University of South Wales campus in Treforest, Hughes is at ease in newish surroundings, citing a conversation with a loan player. “I went through a presentation we shared with our players on the first day and just said: ‘This is us, this is what we’ve got, and we’re really proud of it. It might not be what you’re used to where you’ve come from, but it’s ours.’ Let’s not look over the fence at what other people have got.”
Newport have done things their way in pre-season, completing a recovery session at the lido in Pontypridd and heading to the former boxer Jamie Arthur’s gym in nearby Rhydyfelin.
“It was almost like a mental toughness, conditioning session,” says Hughes. “It was just to try and take the group somewhere else … where you think about the skill set you need to be a boxer, they definitely suffer to win. And all we’re trying to do is have a culture where we understand and appreciate that winning looks different at times. To win games of football, at times you’ve got to suffer.”
That pain was apparent on Tuesday, when Newport overcame Barnet on penalties to reach the EFL Cup first round after squandering their two-goal lead in second-half stoppage time. That triumph represented Hughes’s first match and win, and it was a game in which Newport donned their striking new away kit – commemorating the 36 children who relocated to Caerleon from Bilbao after fleeing the Spanish civil war in 1937 – for the first time. The shirt is modelled on Athletic’s red-and-white stripes and on the label, beneath the flags of the Basque Country and Wales, a message reads: “In 1937, when the Basque people needed help, Wales responded.”
As for those who have helped Hughes along the way and whether he consulted them before signing a two-year contract at Rodney Parade, the answer is yes. Hughes, who credits his youth-team coach at Villa, Tony McAndrew, as a big influence, spoke to, among others, Rob Edwards, who swapped his role with England’s age groups for Forest Green Rovers in the fourth tier, the Wales manager Craig Bellamy and Sean Dyche, whom he worked alongside at Watford.
“We all see the game differently but there are pillars that underpin performance and hard work has to be one of those,” Hughes says, referencing positive conversations with the Newport chairman, Huw Jenkins, who completed his takeover 18 months ago. “Success will look different for us compared to other teams. We’re aware of the constraints we’re under, but those constraints are definitely not excuses,” Hughes says. “We know it’s going to be tough, we know there’s going to be some turbulence along the way. But, most importantly, we’re going to enjoy it.”
