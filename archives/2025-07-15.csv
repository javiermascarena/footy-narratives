Brentford unlikely to sell both Man Utd target Mbeumo and Wissa,Brentford are highly unlikely to sell both Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa this summer amid interest from several Premier League clubs.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396552/bryan-mbeumo-and-yoane-wissa-transfer-news-brentford-unlikely-to-sell-both-amid-man-utd-spurs-newcastle-forest-interest,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 13:46:00",Lyall Thomas,['Manchester United'],"Brentford are highly unlikely to sell both Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa this summer amid interest from several Premier League clubs.
Manchester United have been in talks with Brentford for Mbeumo for some time, but there remains in a gap in their respective valuations of the forward.
United's offer of a £55m fixed fee plus £7.5m in add-ons falls short of the £65m Brentford want, including all, if not most, up front.
Meanwhile, Wissa is a target for Tottenham, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, the latter recently having a bid rejected for the Congo striker.
Whichever club agrees a deal for Wissa or Mbeumo would almost certainly rule out the sale of the other.
Brentford selling Mbeumo and Wissa would be such a significant loss of goals and attacking talent that it would be near-impossible for the club to lose them.
That has especially become the case after losing manager Thomas Frank to Tottenham and their captain Christian Norgaard to Arsenal.
Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last season while Wissa netted 19. Mbeumo joined in 2019 from Troyes for just over £4m, while Wissa signed from Lorient for around £7.2m in 2021.
Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.
Bees sporting director Phil Giles told Sky Sports News that Mbeumo would be happy to stay at the club if a deal, which has to be ""right for Brentford"", does not materialise.

Are Chelsea Premier League title contenders?,"Chelsea qualified for the Champions League, won the Conference League and became Club World Cup champions in Enzo Maresca's first season in charge.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396589/are-chelsea-premier-league-title-contenders-enzo-marescas-side-thriving-after-club-world-cup-success,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 14:54:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea qualified for the Champions League, won the Conference League and became Club World Cup champions in Enzo Maresca's first season in charge.
Can they now launch a Premier League title challenge?
Chelsea fans turned against Maresca at half-time of their fixture at Fulham in April.
Having won only once in their previous four games, their Champions League hopes were fading until Tyrique George and Pedro Neto produced a dramatic late turnaround. It proved to be the turning point of their season.
Chelsea won 13 of their final 15 matches with Maresca tweaking his system and also experimenting at the Club World Cup by using every outfield player.
Reece James has played alongside Moises Caicedo in midfield, allowing Enzo Fernandez to thrive further forward.
Full-backs Marc Cucurella and Malo Gusto stayed wide at the Club World Cup rather than coming into the middle and Cole Palmer shone playing on the right wing rather than behind the striker.
It was also noticeable how often Chelsea played longer against PSG, bypassing their trademark press, and using their pace and power to get up the pitch.
Maresca's possession style has turned exciting.
Chelsea came unstuck when Nicolas Jackson injured his hamstring midway through last season. Christopher Nkunku was unable to fill the void and winger Pedro Neto had to play as a striker. Palmer's drastic drop in form coincided with their sticky run too.
They won't have the same forward issues next season. The additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap have shown a statement of intent that the club wants to compete on all fronts. They can also call upon youngsters Marc Guiu and George.
The trio scored 32 goals between them in the Premier League last season. The bigger issue will be keeping them all happy with regular playing time. Rumours of an exit for Jackson have already started.
Robert Sanchez was jeered by Chelsea fans at times last season when he had the ball at his feet. His five errors leading to goals, the joint-most in the Premier League, didn't cost Chelsea a Champions League spot but left most thinking he needed to be replaced.
""I can't see someone winning the Premier League with that goalkeeper and without a standout centre-back,"" said Jamie Carragher in December. He followed it up a month later by saying Sanchez is a goalkeeper for a ""bottom-half"" club.
Chelsea walked away from signing AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan before the Club World Cup, which appeared to lift Sanchez ahead of the tournament.
The 27-year-old kept four clean sheets, shining in the final with six saves to earn the Golden Glove and his accurate long kicking troubled PSG on the counter-attack. This could be a turning point in his Chelsea career - it has to be if they want to challenge for the title.
Todd Boehly now has something to show for his £1.5bn spending at Chelsea.
A Champions League place, a Conference League trophy and a Club World Cup triumph have laid Gary Neville's iconic line to rest.
Chelsea are looking the real deal with a young squad that has quickly inherited the club's trophy-winning mentality.
The estimated £111m in Club World Cup prize money will help to balance the books too.
The fixture computer has handed Chelsea a favourable start to the season, beginning at home to Crystal Palace on August 17, live on Sky Sports.
West Ham, Fulham and Brentford follow before they head out of London for the first time when they visit Manchester United.
Chelsea also have the second-best set of fixtures following mid-week European matches of the nine Premier League sides involved.
They'll play away from home just twice, against Manchester United and Crystal Palace, travelling only 341 miles after playing in the Champions League.
But how will they recover from a 64-game season that finally ended in July? There are just 25 days between the Club World Cup final and their first pre-season game against Bayer Leverkusen on August 8 followed by AC Milan two days later.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Chelsea can win league or Champions League - Colwill,"Chelsea's Club World Cup proves they are ready to win the Premier League or Champions League as soon as next season, says defender Levi Colwill.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz7l2l7e7dzo,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:01:27",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea's Club World Cup win proves they are ready to win the Premier League or Champions League as soon as next season, says defender Levi Colwill.
The 22-year-old started the shock 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, which crowned the Blues became world champions for the next four years in Fifa's expanded global tournament.
Asked whether Chelsea can build on that success to win either the Premier League or Champions League, Colwill replied: ""Yeah, definitely.
He added: ""I said at the start of this tournament that our plan is to win it and people looked at me as if I was crazy. So I'm going to say the exact same thing now going into the Premier League and Champions League.
""This is the biggest trophy I've ever won. I think the Club World Cup will be bigger than the Champions League and we were the first team to win it.
""It was a statement victory and, in the future, if we keep winning trophies then everyone will give us the love that we deserve.
""But we'll only know that in he future. I think we're ready and we'll see next season.""
Chelsea finished fourth in the Premier League last season and won the Conference League in an impressive first season under the leadership of manager Enzo Maresca.
It has been a significant year for Chelsea co-owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, after they earned their first real success since buying the club in 2022.
Their signing of a large number of young players on lengthy contracts has proven unpopular with some within the football community, but Colwill believes Chelsea now have a winning team capable of emulating the past.
""We're a team and that's in the Chelsea identity. You stick together no matter what. I think players like John Terry, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, they started that and we're carrying it on,"" he said.
""They were all amazing players, the best players who won a lot but we've got the best players in our team - young players for sure - and that's our plan: to win the biggest trophies for Chelsea.
""We're definitely capable of doing it. I think we've shown that. Everyone said that PSG were the best team in the world but we won 3-0.""

Defender Tuanzebe sues former club Man Utd,Former Manchester United defender Axel Tuanzebe is suing the club for alleged negligent medical advice.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c04d25r24vyo,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 12:15:12",Nick Mashiter,['Manchester United'],"Former Manchester United defender Axel Tuanzebe is suing the club for alleged negligent medical advice.
The 27-year-old, who joined Burnley earlier this month, filed a legal claim with the High Court against United last week.
It relates to a period from July 2022 involving an unknown injury and is considered a high value claim, which is understood to be more than £1m.
Tuanzebe was out for 195 days in his final season at the club before he was loaned to Stoke in January 2023, where he made just five appearances.
He joined the club when he was eight, making his debut in 2017, and played 37 times for them before leaving in the summer of 2023, joining Ipswich as a free agent that September.
The right-back captained United at every level and his final appearance for the club was in the 2021 Europa League final loss to Villarreal, where he scored in the shootout as they lost 11-10 on penalties.
The former England Under-21 international - who now represents DR Congo - also had three spells on loan at Aston Villa, while he also spent time at Napoli in 2022.
Tuanzebe's lawyers, Simons Muirhead Burton, and United both declined to comment when approached by BBC Sport.

Following the Blues' 3-0 win over Paris St-Germain in New Jersey on Sunday, Trump presented the trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James before being invited to move aside by Fifa president Gianni Infantino.
However, Trump remained alongside James and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, and applauded as James lifted the trophy - staying in position for a few seconds before he and Infantino left at the rear of the stage.
England international James said: ""They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage, and I thought that he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay.
""He just congratulated me and the team for lifting the trophy and told us to enjoy the moment.""
Cole Palmer, who scored twice for Chelsea in the final, added: ""I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy.
""I was a bit confused, yes.""
The conclusion of the revamped, expanded Club World Cup - which included extensive pre-match entertainment and a half-time show - was attended by 81,118 people at MetLife Stadium.
Trump watched Chelsea's impressive victory in the final alongside Infantino and said in an interview with Dazn at half-time that he was ""having a really great time"".
In a longer interview broadcast later on Sunday, he added: ""Gianni is a friend of mine, he's done such a great job with the league and with soccer - or as they would call it 'football', but I guess we call it soccer. I'm not sure that change could be made very easily.
""But it's great to watch - and this is a little bit of an upset that we're watching today, isn't it?""
When it was suggested he could make an executive order so that the sport was referred to as ""football"" from now on, Trump smiled and said: ""I think we could do that. I think I could do that.""

Defender Mosquera agrees terms with Arsenal,Arsenal's pursuit of Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera moves closer with the player agreeing personal terms with the Gunners.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czey2dyr314o,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 09:29:26",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"Valencia centre-back Cristhian Mosquera has agreed personal terms with Arsenal, with a move to the Premier League club getting closer.
BBC Sport previously reported that Arsenal were in talks to sign the 21-year-old but now another element to the deal has been completed.
The Gunners have been looking to add a young defender to their squad to compete with William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes.
Mosquera can play at both centre-back and right-back and will fill the gap in the squad left by the departure of Takehiro Tomiyasu, who mutually agreed to terminate his contract.
The Spain Under-21 international has made 90 appearances for Valencia and was a regular last season, playing the full match in 37 of the club's 38 La Liga games.
Arsenal have been busy during this transfer window and have signed Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad, Christian Norgaard from Brentford and Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea.
The Gunners are also close to completing a deal with Sporting for striker Viktor Gyokeres and are hoping to complete a deal inside the next 24 hours for 73.5m euros (£63.5m).
A versatile defender who used to be a winger
Mosquera, who was born in Alicante but has Colombian heritage, started out as a basketball player before making the switch to futsal and joining local side San Blas Canavate, who were looking for an additional player to play in a youth tournament
He swapped his love of futsal for football in 2013, joining Alicante's biggest team Hercules, and playing as a pacey winger. He then joined Valencia's youth set-up as a 12-year-old in 2016.
Six years progressing through the club's youth ranks sparked his transformation into a defender, and he finally made his first team debut in a Copa del Rey fixture against CD Atletico Baleares in January 2022.
He can play at both centre-back and right-back and has now racked up 90 senior appearances for Valencia, scoring one goal along the way.
Arsenal already boast several of the Premier League's best one-on-one defenders, and in Mosquera they'd be signing a player who excels against opponents with the ball at their feet.
The 21-year-old won 70.7% of his ground duels in La Liga last season, far surpassing any other central defender to have contested at least 100 of them.
He also won possession an average of 5.15 times per 90 minutes, the third-highest figure in the division among players in his position.
A far better option for opponents is to take the aerial route against Mosquera.
Despite being 6ft 2in, the Colombian proved as suspect in the air last season as he was imperious on the grass – his meagre success rate of 45.2% in aerial duels was the fourth-worst among central defenders who started regularly.
The move for Mosquera should give Mikel Arteta formidable strength in depth at centre-back though.
In addition to the first-choice pairing of William Saliba and Gabriel, the Gunners can also call upon Jakub Kiwior, and while Riccardo Calafiori, Jurrien Timber and Ben White have mainly featured at full-back, all three had plenty of experience in central defence before joining.
Kiwior normally provides cover for fellow left-footer Gabriel and filled in successfully when the Brazilian missed the final eight weeks of last season through injury. Mosquera is therefore initially likely to serve as dedicated back-up for Saliba as the right-sided centre-back.
But one of the advantages to recruiting Mosquera is his ability to play in either channel.
The Spaniard's breakthrough campaign was in 2023-24, when 85% of his league minutes for Valencia came as the right-sided centre-back. The following year the emergence of Cesar Tarrega meant Mosquera was often moved to the left, making 62% of his appearances there.
While Arsenal released the versatile but injury-plagued Takehiro Tomiyasu this summer, the signing of 21-year-old Mosquera should mean the Gunners have more than enough defensive options available.

Man Utd fan admits slapping Grealish at derby,"Alfie Holt, 20, is given a three-year football banning order and ordered to pay a £120 fine.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdezpzp5pydo,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:20:35",,['Manchester United'],"A Manchester United fan has admitted assaulting Manchester City player Jack Grealish by slapping his face after he claimed the footballer insulted him.
Alfie Holt, 20, pleaded guilty to a single count of assault on Grealish, who he said had called him ugly and a swear word after the Manchester Derby on 6 April, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard.
Holt, a Manchester United season ticket holder in the Stretford End, was given a three-year Football Banning Order and ordered to pay a £120 fine.
The defendant, of Droylsden, Tameside, told the court: ""I did not expect [Grealish] to say what he said to me and I have reacted. I regret it. That's it.""
Shazia Aslam, prosecuting, told the court Grealish was leaving the field after the Manchester Derby at Old Trafford, which was always a ""contentious affair"".
""Both sets of fans were very vocal, shouting abusive comments to rival players,"" Ms Aslam said.
The court heard that as players left the field, heading for the tunnel, Holt stood very close by, shouting abuse at City players.
Grealish then heard Holt's comments and walked back towards him before they had an ""exchange of words"", she said.
""As the complainant walks away, the defendant slaps the complainant across the face.""
She said there was no injury and Holt had been arrested outside the stadium.
In a witness statement, Grealish told police he could not hear what the defendant was shouting due to the crowd noise, so he walked towards him and tried to engage in conversation and leaned in to speak to him.
He said he was still unable to hear, so he moved to walk away when he was slapped.
'Vulnerable players'
After his arrest, Holt told police he had been drinking before the game ""in town"" and went to the match with his father.
He said he had been shouting abuse at City players, including Phil Foden, who had ignored him.
He then shouted an insult at Grealish, who reacted and a ""verbal altercation took place,"" the court heard.
Holt told police he had ""flipped"" when Grealish had insulted him back and he reached out and slapped the footballer.
Magistrates were shown a brief clip of the incident, which had no sound.
Ms Aslam said: ""The defendant uses force against a player. Players are extremely vulnerable to this sort of conduct and need to be protected.""
Melanie Winstantley, defending, said Holt had no previous convictions and had never been arrested before, so the incident was completely out of character for him.
She said his Manchester United season ticket, which he had for 12 years, had already been revoked, which was a ""significant punishment"" to him.
""He's admitted what he's done, he's owned what he's done. It's a very minor assault,"" she said.
Ms Winstanley told the court Grealish had ""doubled back"" after going into the tunnel to speak to Holt.
She added: ""He didn't have to do that. It's not unusual for players and fans to engage in banter at football matches.
""I'm not trying to excuse the behaviour.""
Passing sentence, chairwoman of the magistrates' bench Jill Hodges told Holt she accepted he had pleaded guilty and he appeared to regret his actions, but there must be ""punishment and deterrence"" for such behaviour.
He was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a surcharge of £48.
The court heard fines could not be deducted from Holt's Personal Independence Payments, so his parents, who he lives with, agreed to pay them in full within 28 days.

Man Utd lay tribute to Jota and Silva at Anfield,Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim is joined by players Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot as they visit Anfield to pay tribute to Portuguese compatriots Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czry263e1x0o,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:41:03",Mandeep Sanghera,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim was joined by players Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot at Anfield to pay tribute to Portuguese compatriots Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva on behalf of the Old Trafford club.

"Bigger, better, more often? Infantino won’t let up on his ambition for Club World Cup","With claims of 2bn TV views, $2.1bn revenues and a push for it to go every two years, Infantino’s pet project is here to stay",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/15/bigger-better-more-often-infantino-wont-let-up-on-his-ambition-for-club-world-cup,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 07:00:50",Matt Hughes,['Chelsea'],"All that can be said with certainty about the future of the Club World Cup is that it is not going away. The 24-carat gold Tiffany trophy presented to Reece James by Donald Trump in New York, in one of the most surreal scenes seen in a sports stadium, will be up for grabs again in four years. The event could well be bigger, Fifa intends it to be better and the presentation will surely not be as brash.
Gianni Infantino was widely criticised for imposing the Club World Cup on an indifferent sporting public, against a backdrop of hostility from players’ unions and domestic leagues, but his belief that top clubs would back his vision has been vindicated, albeit largely because of the $1bn prize fund. With Chelsea banking £85m for winning seven matches, others are keen for a slice of the pie.
The Guardian reported last month that Fifa is considering expanding the competition to 48 teams in 2029, and it is facing calls from some clubs to stage it more frequently. During talks involving Fifa, the clubs and the confederations in Miami during the tournament, it is understood Real Madrid raised the prospect of holding the tournament every two years in an echo of Arsène Wenger’s abortive campaign for a biennial World Cup.
Madrid have been the Club World Cup’s biggest success in commercial terms, their fans responsible for 25% of ticket sales. The club need to service a €1.2bn loan taken out to fund the redevelopment of the Bernabéu and are determined to cash in on their global appeal.
Fifa has no plans to accede to Madrid’s wishes, because even Infantino accepts that would be overkill, but discussions over expanding to 48 teams in 2029 remain very much on the table. Infantino, in a rare public appearance at which he took questions on Saturday, at Fifa’s new office at Trump Tower, name-checked Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Barcelona, Napoli and Milan as clubs he would love to have involved in the 2029 tournament. Clubs from the old world still bring in the biggest cheques in the new.
Sunday’s defeated finalists, Paris Saint-Germain, are the only European club to have qualified for 2029, by winning this year’s Champions League. As it stands Chelsea will have to earn the right to defend their title through European performances, although that could change.
Fifa officials have privately conceded that the qualification process is up in the air, as is the venue. As revealed by the Guardian, Qatar staked its claim to bid in meetings in Miami last month, but there is a sense that Fifa would prefer a joint production from the 2030 World Cup hosts, Morocco, Spain and Portugal. Morocco and Spain, though, want to host the competition alone and Portugal has expressed no interest.
The broadcaster could stay the same, with Fifa indebted to Dazn for bankrolling the tournament with a $1bn global deal, funded by the purchase of 10% of the company by Saudi Arabia’s SURJ Sports Investment. Infantino praised “a one-of-a-kind revolutionary contract with Dazn” on Saturday, and the streaming company is happy with the results of its biggest venture yet.
Viewing figures have yet to be made public, but Dazn insiders say they are delighted with the engagement and that it brought more than 2bn views, with about 5% of viewers signing up to its premium service. The ratings have been particularly high in Brazil on the back of Fluminense reaching the semi-finals and Palmeiras the last eight, with more than 180m views. Chelsea’s first game against Los Angeles brought 8m log-ons to the Dazn app, with the global audience reaching about 25m when sub-licence deals such as Channel 5 in the UK are included.
Infantino said the Club World Cup had generated revenues of $2.1bn, an average of $33m a match, with total ticket sales of 2.5m and an average crowds of 40,000. Staging most games in huge NFL stadiums led to some ugly optics of sparsely attended games, particularly at the early kick-offs designed to appeal to a European television audience, but Fifa believes the show of ambition was worth it.
Concerns over player welfare remain unresolved amid a legal complaint from the global players’ union, Fifpro. Bayern Munich’s Jamal Musiala was the only player to sustain a serious injury but complaints about the extreme heat and playing conditions were numerous, and the real impact of the Club World Cup on the combatants will be known only during the months ahead.
By that point Infantino will have moved on to plotting the next Club World Cup in pursuit of Fifa domination.

Premier League fans in Asia want to feel valued – and not just as a source of revenue,"Pre-season trips to Asia may not be new for English clubs, but they remain a huge global engagement opportunity",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/15/premier-league-fans-in-asia-want-to-feel-valued-and-not-just-as-a-source-of-revenue,"Tue, 15 Jul 2025 07:00:51",John Duerden,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United', 'Liverpool', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Fifty years ago, Arsenal lost 2-0 to Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, with jet-lagged players struggling to deal with frogs bouncing around the Merdeka Stadium pitch as well as the legendary local striker Mokhtar Dahari.
Since then, however, many aspects of Asian tours by English clubs have changed. They have become, mostly, slick affairs. This summer, Arsenal will visit neighbouring Singapore for games against Newcastle and Milan. Then to Hong Kong for an unusual north London derby against a Tottenham team that will also travel to South Korea to face Newcastle. Liverpool visit Japan and Hong Kong just weeks after Manchester United were in action there on a post-season tour, which they finished in Malaysia.
Not all has changed, though. Arsenal received an undisclosed sum back in the mists of time and generating revenue is still the order of the day. There are millions of fans in Asia who want to see their favourite teams and if they are lucky enough to live in the continent’s richer countries – you don’t see many exhibitions in Laos or Bangladesh, by contrast – clubs are happy to oblige. Sneering at such exhibitions is easy; harder is staying up into the early hours, weekend after weekend, season after season.
“These opportunities don’t come around often,” Sawita Chuasukontip, an Arsenal fan in Thailand, says. “There’s real excitement as everyone eagerly anticipates the team’s visit to Asia, from the announcement of the tour to the ticket sales. Many fans can’t make the trip to Europe to see games. That’s why the club’s visit is so significant, it gives fans the chance to experience their favourite team up close without the long journey.”
Fans in Malaysia felt the same when Manchester United visited in May. “It’s important as most of us can’t afford to fly across the world to see them live and fans do enjoy them,” says Aysha Ridzuan, a fan and Kuala Lumpur-based sports social media consultant. “For some, it’s like a dream come true to see them up close.”
United’s time in Malaysia almost turned into a nightmare with a 1-0 loss to an Asean All Stars team and negative headlines about the behaviour and attitude of certain players. “It’s a shame the recent one didn’t go so well – arriving so soon from a tough season,” Ridzuan adds. “But I hope they don’t take a long time to come again because it’s proven that they have a huge fanbase here. Even after an awful season, over 70,000 people still turned up to see them in action.”
The verdict on the performance was not kind after the defeat, but these kinds of games are becoming less common. “Fans are bored of European teams coming in and playing against the national team or All Star teams, that’s been done to death and very rarely creates a good match,” Marcus Luer, who staged the United v Liverpool clash in Bangkok three years ago, says. There is a growing trend of big European clubs facing rivals instead of hastily assembled local sides. This may lead to higher prices but fans have shown they want the occasion to be as authentic as possible.
They also want the clubs to show they care. “I just want them to make the most of their tour, like reaching out to underprivileged fans, like children in remote areas or those with limited financial resources,” Jittakorn Srikhamkhrua, a Thai Liverpool fan and influencer, says. “I’d like the club to create more tangible opportunities for these individuals.”
The more clubs do on tour, the better it is. Fans in Asia want to feel valued and not just as a source of revenue. “It not only helps strengthen connections with the fans but might also encourage more Asian supporters to travel to Europe to watch matches in person,” Chuasukontip says. “Importantly, it shows the clubs’ commitment and care for their fans, even from a distance.”
Clubs need to work on that commitment all the time. “Asian supporters want 24/7, 365 engagement with their favourite clubs and for a club simply to visit a country, say, once every four years is simply not enough,” Simon Chadwick, professor of Eurasian sport at Emlyon Business School in Paris, says.
Manchester United’s immersive Theatre of Dreams experience and entertainment centres in China are an example of what can be done. “They give fans the opportunity to be close, even though the team is elsewhere,” Chadwick adds. “This suggests that virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital technologies are likely to be the most effective means of sustaining relationships with remote fans. The question is, will clubs be prepared to invest in them?” If so, then the visits could go to a new level. “Asian tours have never peaked because European clubs have never taken them as seriously as they should,” Chadwick says.
It is not just about engaging with current fans but winning over new ones, too. Lifting major trophies is the best way and, while it could be that gruelling trips to Asia in pre-season do not help, this is the reality in which clubs operate. “Research has always shown that the main point of engagement for many prospective fans is on-field success,” says Chadwick. “But engagement is not simply about watching 90 seconds of highlights on mobile devices, audiences want touch and feel experiences … finding a balance between success and experience is one of the big challenges European clubs face.”

"Transfer latest: Arsenal agree £16.5m deal for Mosquera, Wolves poised to sign Arias",Arsenal to pay Valencia initial £13m for defender,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/14/transfer-latest-arsenal-agree-cristhian-mosquera-deal-valencia-wolves-jhon-arias-fluminense,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 14:14:29",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal are hoping to complete the signing of Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia this week in a deal that could take their summer spending past £200m.
Negotiations with Valencia over the 21-year-old defender have been taking place since an initial offer of £14m including bonuses was rejected this month. It is understood an agreement has been struck for Arsenal to pay an initial £13m plus up to £3.5m in bonuses.
Mikel Arteta’s squad are due to fly to Singapore for the first leg of their Asian tour on Saturday and there is a chance that Mosquera – who represented Spain at this summer’s European Under-21 Championship but is also eligible to play for Colombia – could complete his move in time to join his new teammates. Mosquera was identified as Arsenal’s main target to provide competition for William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães after establishing himself as a first choice for Valencia over the past two seasons.
His deal means Arsenal have committed to spending potentially more than £200m on players since March’s appointment of the sporting director, Andrea Berta. They are also poised to announce the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea for up to £52m and have agreed a deal with Sporting for Viktor Gyökeres, with the total package for the Sweden striker potentially worth £64m.
Arsenal have confirmed the arrivals of Martín Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for about £55m, Christian Nørgaard from Brentford for up to £12m and Kepa Arrizabalaga from Chelsea for £5m. They remain interested in Eberechi Eze of Crystal Palace but have yet to make an official approach for the England forward, who has a £67.5m release clause.
It is understood Arsenal are hoping to offload some fringe players as Arteta continues to shape his squad, with Leandro Trossard attracting interest from Bayern Munich and Fenerbahce. Jakub Kiwior – who deputised for the injured Gabriel at the end of last season but could find himself down the pecking order given Mosquera’s arrival – Fábio Vieira, Reiss Nelson and Oleksandr Zinchenko are among others facing uncertain futures.
Wolves are poised to sign one of the stars of the Club World Cup in Fluminense’s Jhon Arias. The Colombia winger, who impressed as the Brazilian club exited in the semi-finals to the eventual winners Chelsea, will cost about £15m. Arias will boost Vítor Pereira’s attacking ranks after the £62.5m departure of Matheus Cunha and is in line to become Wolves’ third summer signing after the £19.5m arrival of Fer López from Celta Vigo.
Jørgen Strand Larsen, who scored 14 Premier League goals last season, has also signed from Vigo after his loan move was made permanent.
Aston Villa have agreed to sign the experienced goalkeeper Marco Bizot, with the club thought to be paying a six-figure fee to take the Dutchman from the Ligue 1 side Brest, for whom he played in the Champions League last season.
The 34-year-old has played regularly as a No 1 over the past four seasons in France and before that impressed in the Eredivisie and Belgian Pro League with AZ and Genk respectively. He is expected to be joining Villa as a backup goalkeeper, though uncertainty surrounds the long-term future of Emiliano Martínez. Bizot began his career at Ajax and won his sole Netherlands cap in 2020, playing in a friendly against Spain while with AZ.

Tuanzebe launches legal complaint against Manchester United alleging ‘medical negligence’,Player’s claim relates to injury in final year at club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/14/tuanzebe-launches-legal-complaint-against-manchester-united-alleging-medical-negligence,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:56:26",Jamie Jackson,['Manchester United'],"Axel Tuanzebe has lodged a legal complaint against Manchester United alleging “medical negligence”, with the claim by the club’s former defender relating to an injury sustained in or after July 2022.
A submission entitled “Tuanzebe v Manchester United Football Club Limited” was registered last Wednesday at the high court, with the case type described as “Clinical Negligence – Part 7 Claim – Medical Advice”. The claim is understood to relate to an injury in his final year at the club.
Tuanzebe, who joined Burnley this month on a free transfer, endured an injury-disrupted six years at United after his debut in a 4-0 FA Cup win over West Ham in January 2017, before leaving for Ipswich in the summer of 2023.
The defender made only 37 United appearances, with injuries limiting his opportunities, though he also had three loans at Aston Villa and one spel at each of Napoli and Stoke.
In September 2019 he became United’s youngest captain since 1985 when Ole Gunnar Solskjær gave him the armband for a Carabao Cup third-round tie against Rochdale. It meant that Tuanzebe, who joined United aged eight, had captained the club at every level.
When contacted by the Guardian, United declined to comment.
Darren Fletcher, meanwhile, has been appointed lead coach of United’s Under-18s. The Scot returned to the club in 2021, having been there as a player for 20 years, and has had roles including technical director and a coach with the first team.
Jason Wilcox, United’s director of football, said: “He knows exactly what it takes to be a successful academy graduate and has played a key role in shaping the pathway for so many of our young players in recent years.”

Cole Palmer’s Chelsea finally believe they are Premier League contenders | Jacob Steinberg,"Aggressive, motivated, extremely talented and now champions of the world, Enzo Maresca’s squad have the confidence and real depth",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/14/cole-palmers-chelsea-finally-have-the-belief-they-are-contenders-for-premier-league-title,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:46:28",Jacob Steinberg,['Chelsea'],"When Chelsea won the Conference League in May, a victory secured by the standard ice‑cold Cole Palmer performance in a final, the reaction was restrained and there was no internal talk of an impending title challenge. Now the vibe is different. It is hard not to dream when Chelsea perform as they did against Paris Saint‑Germain in the final of the Club World Cup.
Nobody is getting carried away. Chelsea know what the rest of us know, which is that they are not the best team in the world. They are not the finished article. They are young and still have much to learn. Yet there is a gold badge on the shirt for the next four years and if Chelsea woke up feeling $100m on Monday morning it will not only have been because of the prize money made during their month in the US.
Where does this end? Chelsea have built priceless momentum and will head into the new season with serious aspirations of winning the Premier League and going far in the Champions League. They are youthful, aggressive, motivated and extremely talented. They are champions of the world, an achievement that should not be played down. They were the second-youngest side at the Club World Cup and have benefited from treating it seriously. They have grown as a team, honing their tactical vision and hardening their mentality, and it has done wonders for Enzo Maresca’s standing as head coach after a challenging first year.
Maresca has seemed on dodgy ground at times. He wobbled during a difficult spell after Christmas and has not found it easy to convince match-going fans to embrace his patient, positional football. The players, though, are different. Maresca clearly has total buy-in from the squad. “He is building something special,” Palmer said after leading the destruction of PSG with two goals and an assist for João Pedro before half-time. “He’s a top coach,” Malo Gusto said before the final. “He’s always watching his next opponent and doing analysis. That helps us.”
Maresca’s plan was perfect against PSG. Chelsea were coherent and disciplined. “The first 10 minutes, the team was there to showed that we were there to win,” Maresca said. Chelsea were physical from the start. They went direct, beating Luis Enrique’s ferocious pressing system, and targeted PSG’s left flank. “That’s where we tried to win the game,” Maresca said. “But you can give the players a plan – in the end it’s them who have to execute it.”
Chelsea delivered, the collective combining to create conditions for Palmer’s quality to shine. It should do wonders for their confidence. They are back in the Champions League after a two-year absence and will believe they can compete with the best after doing to PSG what the French club have been doing to everyone else in Europe during the past eight months.
This is a project moving in the right direction. Palmer is the jewel in the crown – incredibly he was unwell last week but still left PSG feeling under the weather – but it is a team effort. The work conducted by the recruitment team of Paul Winstanley, Joe Shields, Laurence Stewart and Sam Jewell cannot be overlooked. They have faced external criticism but will earn more respect after this triumph.
The question is whether Chelsea can push on. They were reluctant to say that they were challengers last season, even when two points off the top just before Christmas. But something shifted when they got over the line during the run-in and finished fourth. Champions League qualification gave them belief; thumping PSG enhances it.
“I said at the start of this tournament that our plan is to win it and people looked at me as if I was crazy,” Levi Colwill said. “I’m going to say the exact same thing now going into the Premier League and Champions League. I think we’re ready.”
Chelsea look stronger. João Pedro has transformed the attack in the space of two weeks, impressing with his pressing, mobility and link play. Maresca has options. He was able to bring on Liam Delap against PSG and use the striker’s pace on the break. Chelsea have different modes of attack. They can counter with Pedro Neto’s pace on the flanks. Jamie Gittens and Estêvão Willian are joining and will provide more depth on the flanks. Another positive from the tournament? Estêvão proving he can take on English defences by scoring against Chelsea in his final game for Palmeiras.
The unknown is whether Chelsea are going to be more adept at breaking down low blocks. There was space against PSG but other sides will not be as accommodating. Chelsea are going to come up against a lot of deep defences. It is partly why João Pedro has been signed; Maresca regards the Brazilian’s versatility as a way to unlock tight games. Enzo Fernández’s development as a box-crashing midfielder is another plus.
There will be challenges, not least when it comes to dealing with the physical impact of the Club World Cup. Chelsea have three weeks off before returning for pre-season and host Crystal Palace in their opening Premier League game. It is hard to know how this plays out. They could use the positive vibes to hit the ground running but there may come a point when they crash. Or they may start slowly and find themselves in another battle for the top four. The additional demands of an expanded Champions League further complicates matters. Chelsea were able to rest their A‑listers in the Conference League but that is not an option this time. It is acknowledged that Maresca needs cover for Marc Cucurella at left-back.
But the squad does not need a lot of work. It is said that Robert Sánchez is not a title-winning goalkeeper but he was outstanding against PSG. There has been a lot of talk about a new centre-back but Chelsea gave away little against Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. There is depth in a lot of other positions.
Not that it will be quiet before the window shuts. Chelsea’s bank balance has been boosted and they are nothing if not afraid to trade. Noni Madueke is going to Arsenal and another attacker could be targeted if Nicolas Jackson or Christopher Nkunku leaves. Tyrique George has a lot of wingers in front of him. Chelsea have been fined by Uefa for breaching financial fair play rules and must generate positive income if they are to register new players in their Champions League squad. The goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic is joining Bournemouth for £25m. Chelsea have outcasts to sell; plenty of ways to bring in money. Buyers must be found for Raheem Sterling, João Félix, Axel Disasi and many more.
That element of the approach led by Clearlake Capital, the club’s majority owner, leaves some observers cold. It is important that Chelsea embrace stability and keep the core group together. “We’ve got the best players in our team, young players, and that’s our plan: to win the biggest trophies for Chelsea,” Colwill said. “No matter what, we’ve got to stick together.” He was on top of the world. Chelsea have no intention of crashing back to earth. They think this is just the beginning.

From Palmer and domes to Musiala and turf: Club World Cup winners and losers,A tournament won by Chelsea exposed international divides and sparked questions about workload and weather,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/14/club-world-cup-winners-and-losers-cole-palmer-jamal-musiala-domes-turf,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 13:12:39",Alexander Abnos,['Chelsea'],"Winners
Fifa: The world’s governing body had hoped to gain more of a foothold in the club game with the expanded version of this tournament. Now that it has taken place without major disruption or mass protest, chances are it won’t go away any time soon. In many respects, that alone is mission accomplished – Fifa now runs a property that will allow it to control the global profile of some of the world’s biggest soccer properties, which had been mostly out of its reach. There are also plenty of positive storylines Fifa can pick to tout (more than 2.4m cumulative attendance and any number of highlights on the field), even if some of those are balanced out by some less flattering realities (more than 1.5m empty seats).
Uefa: For all the talk early in the tournament about how South American sides had come to play and were giving Uefa’s big names a run for their money, the end result confirmed what the soccer world already knew: the best teams play in Europe. In 35 games against non-Uefa opposition at the Club World Cup, Uefa teams won 23, drew seven and lost five. Uefa teams were awarded more than $340m (£253m) of performance-related prize money, which is more than 70% of the total available.
Cole Palmer: The England international was electric in the final against Paris Saint-Germain, scoring twice and assisting on a third as Chelsea ran away as surprise winners. Palmer took over the No 10 shirt for Chelsea this season and it seems the pressure that number tends to bestow upon its wearer has been a benefit to him, rather than a hindrance. His performance in the final followed solid showings in the group stage and knockouts, in which he played a variety of roles behind the striker. Chelsea will hope that he will carry over his great form stateside into the next Premier League season, rather than reproduce the pedestrian showings that marked much of last season.
Roofs, domes and the Pacific north-west: Heat and weather delays were among a few hiccups that disrupted portions of this tournament, except in locations where they were rendered irrelevant. Domed venues, such as Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, were cool and comfortable even amid a mid-tournament heatwave. Seattle’s Lumen Field, which hosted six games, was naturally comfortable thanks to its location and the climate in that part of the country. Even Pasadena’s Rose Bowl, which experienced one high-heat game among the worst of them, was temperate enough most of the time, with an average temperature of 80F/26C and not too much humidity. Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, admitted to reporters in the lead-up to the final that heat was an issue at this tournament, and that it would address it by playing games under roofed stadiums at next year’s World Cup. He seemed to be suggesting that more daytime games would be played at one of the indoor or covered stadiums, but it is not yet known how Fifa would accomplish this given that the schedule has been determined (though kick-off times have not).
Losers
Most of the players involved: Fifpro, the global union for professional football players, has repeatedly pointed out that the timing of the Club World Cup could cause real harm to the players. Given the ever-increasing number of games in a grueling club season, the tournament always had the potential for unnecessary injuries – never more true than in the case of Bayern’s Jamal Musiala, who sustained a broken and dislocated ankle in a collision with PSG’s goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma that will keep him out for most of the next year. The temperatures were hot, the games intense and the players involved, other than those who came to the tournament mid-season, will have weeks fewer than usual for rest and recovery before heading back into pre-season training. The long-term effects of the Club World Cup might not be fully known until well into the upcoming season, but they’re unlikely to be good.
PSG: Luis Enrique’s side stormed through the tournament, looking every bit the team that demolished Inter 5-0 in the Champions League final. They were the odds-on favorites to win in the final after rolling through Real Madrid, which would have left no doubt about who the best team in the world are (however much of that there was to begin with). Instead, PSG are left to deal with arguably the worst possible outcome: the maximum amount of time spent extending the season, the least amount of rest before the next season, and a measly $88m or so (at minimum) for their trouble. Those winnings are nothing to sneeze at in a vacuum, and could be a help for financial fair play regulations, but the figure also does not represent a significant addition to the coffers of the owner QSI, which has a net worth in the hundreds of billions.

Any confederation other than Uefa and Conmebol: If you were a team hailing from anywhere in the world outside the two power centers of club football, chances are you had a bad time at the Club World Cup. The Asian, African, Oceanian and North and Central American teams in the tournament combined to win 12% of their games on average, with only three of them making the knockout round. Make no mistake, there were fantastic moments such as Al-Hilal’s big win over Manchester City in the last 16. But on the whole, the other confederations will hope the next four years bring about some drastic rebalancing of the club game.
The turf: In several venues, including MetLife Stadium where the final was hosted, artificial turf was overlaid by sod for the Club World Cup. The resulting surface was most certainly better than artificial turf, but it still drew complaints from players and coaches alike. (Said Chelsea’s Reece James of MetLife: “The venue is top. The pitches are not so good. Hopefully there’s some changes for the World Cup next year.”) In the final, Fifa extended cooling breaks to five minutes and brought out sprinklers to water the grass in that time, which a spokesperson said was in response to complaints about the surface becoming too dry in the sun. Next year, the turf at each venue will have a full seven weeks to bed in before it gets used in the tournament. Plenty of interested parties will hope that the extra time makes a difference.

Trump’s presence at Chelsea’s trophy lift was a fitting coda to a misguided tournament | Jonathan Wilson,"The football was at times intriguing, but the true meaning of the first expanded Club World Cup will be debated for years",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/14/the-club-world-cup-final-was-the-latest-example-of-politics-hijacking-football,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 14:50:42",Jonathan Wilson,['Chelsea'],"For the first four weeks of the 2025 Club World Cup, there had been the danger that the tournament would soon be largely forgotten. There is no danger of that after the final. There had been unease after the 2022 World Cup final at the way Qatar inserted itself into the trophy presentation by draping a bisht over Lionel Messi, but at least the Emir kept his distance. Donald Trump, by contrast, placed himself front and centre of the celebrations – and he was soon joined by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, who has a pathological fear of missing out, and must follow his great ally in all things.
And so we were presented with a grimly perfect image of this misguided tournament, a celebrating football team struggling to be seen from behind the politicians who took centre stage. The confusion of Cole Palmer and Reece James at Trump’s continued presence was clear. History, and not just football history, will not forget such shameless grandstanding, or Fifa’s complicity in allowing football to be hijacked by a national leader.
It was a day the ramifications of which will be sifted for years. As a footballing spectacle, it was remarkable, a game in which Palmer produced a performance to elevate him to global stardom, in which Robert Sánchez did much to quiet his many critics, in which Enzo Maresca announced himself as a tactician of the highest rank.
There had been plenty of intrigue earlier in the tournament – Al-Hilal’s last-16 victory over Manchester City and Real Madrid’s capitulation in the semi-final perhaps most notably – but they had always been undercut by doubts as to how seriously each side was taking it. But PSG’s determination to add the world title to the Champions League crown they won in May was obvious and, in the final, they were outplayed to a startling degree.
Luis Enrique’s side had essentially been untouchable since the turn of the year, not just winning games but looking sharper than opponents, on another tactical level. They had outclassed Madrid in the semi-final to the extent that the game was done within 20 minutes. Yet the final was lost by half-time as their left flank was repeatedly over-run. Khvicha Khvaratskelia, whose defensive work is usually so striking, didn’t make a single tackle or interception (PSG’s front three as a whole managed just one regain between them) and Fabián Ruiz was bypassed so that Nuno Mendes, who for a year has seemed obviously the best left-back in the world, was repeatedly exposed, sometimes to Malo Gusto but sometimes, more dangerously, to Palmer.
Palmer produced one of the great final performances, scoring the first with a great finish, the second with a great finish after a dummied pass of almost comical effectiveness and then setting up the third with a barrelling run and perfectly calibrated pass for João Pedro. Perhaps PSG were disadvantaged by having played in the second semi-final; perhaps in the extreme heat an extra 24 hours of rest makes a huge difference. Still, it’s been a long time since anybody has taken Luis Enrique’s PSG apart like that – even if it took two exceptional saves from Sánchez to prevent PSG getting a second-half goal that might have made the denouement more anxious than it was.
There have been plenty who have doubted Maresca’s tactical approach, his apparent over-caution, his obsession with avoiding risk. But on Sunday, he clearly got the gameplan right. Using Pedro Neto as an auxiliary wing-back helped negate the forward surges of Achraf Hakimi but it was on the other flank, the way space was created for Palmer, that the game was won. These were moments that will define careers and, in so doing, offer legitimacy and prestige to the Club World Cup. As world champions, after a performance like that, with a squad of such depth, Chelsea have to be considered serious contenders for the Premier League title.
But in the end, the football seemed an afterthought. There is always something uncomfortable to the European mind in the militarism of US sporting fanfare (which has begun, regrettably, to seep into the FA Cup final). Why was the Star-Spangled Banner played before kick-off? When has the host’s anthem ever previously been played like that at a Fifa event? Why was there a fly-over of military planes?

By the trophy presentation, that had become something much more sinister.
Was the US hosting football, or was football hosting the US? Or rather a particular vision of the US represented by Trump? Fifa has just opened offices in Trump Tower: Infantino’s alliance with the president is both committed and alarming. And having pushed through his vision of the Club World Cup with all its flaws without meaningful consultation, what next for Fifa? Checks and balances simply don’t apply any more.

Chelsea show rest of Europe how to stop PSG in the Champions League,Luis Enrique’s team were starting to look superhuman but Enzo Maresca has found a few chinks in their armour,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/14/chelsea-europe-psg-champions-league-luis-enrique-enzo-maresca,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 19:00:35",Club World Cup 2025,['Chelsea'],"Paris Saint-Germain games often have a Groundhog Day feel: they start with a rugby punt into the corner, fall into a pattern of PSG domination and, invariably, end in victory for Luis Enrique’s side. Be it in Ligue 1, the Champions League or at the Club World Cup, their opponents tend to deploy unambitious low blocks to break the inevitable pattern. But the tactic rarely stifles PSG’s forwards.
PSG have lost just three games in 2025; two of those defeats came in the league, after the title was already secured and attention had shifted towards a maiden European title. A low block against a side so fluid, liberated and technically gifted is submission masquerading as resistance.
Chelsea subverted the trend. So used to exerting territorial and possessional dominance, PSG were immediately put on the back foot. “We won the game in the first 10 minutes. It set the tone,” Enzo Maresca said after his London side lifted the trophy in New Jersey.
Chelsea’s aggressive, man-to-man, high-pressing approach produced a 3-0 win, but they did not dominate all phases of play. The new “world champions” were limited to 33% possession, conceded eight shots and were reliant on Robert Sánchez to produce brilliant saves, notably from Ousmane Dembélé early in the second half.
Chelsea lacked the in-possession structure to fully stifle Luis Enrique’s side, but they kept the dangermen – Dembélé, Désiré Doué, and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – out of the game. By pushing so many players deep into the PSG half, Chelsea managed to stifle the influence of the swashbuckling Vitinha and sever the production lines. Chelsea’s persistent, intense and organised pressing did not limit PSG’s possessional dominance, but it did prevent them from establishing territorial dominance.
“It was difficult for us from the opening minutes,” Luis Enrique said. “I said that Chelsea are a good team. They showed it.” Chelsea unsettled PSG, giving them a taste of their own medicine. And for once, it was the Champions League winners who could not match that energy without the ball.
Kvaratskhelia’s lethargy in pressing and reluctance to recover down his flank was the source of Chelsea’s third goal, a lovely dinked finish from João Pedro. Sánchez, sometimes shaky when pressed, had the time to sweep the ball out to Malo Gusto, who set up Cole Palmer for his first goal. Levi Colwill too had ample time to set up Palmer to get his second, a mirror-image of his opener as he switched the play out to his right. Luis Enrique’s side lacked their characteristic verve and they were punished for it on three occasions as their chances of completing a clean sweep of trophies evaporated inside the first half.
Weaknesses not previously perceived or recognised as such were exploited. Nuno Mendes has been the best left-back in Europe this season. As well as bombing forward, he has also stifled players such as Mohamed Salah and Bukayo Saka in the Champions League. Against Chelsea he provided a reminder of his defensive fallibility and vulnerability to long balls played into his zone.
Lucas Beraldo, positioned next to Mendes in the PSG defence, would have been perceived as a target before the game. He was only starting in the absence of Willian Pacho, whose red card against Bayern Munich ruled him out. The Brazilian, who has now reportedly made a transfer request, has struggled when given chances, and it was no different against Chelsea. All three goals happened within his zone, even if he was not always directly responsible. “We used Cole and Malo on that side to create a little bit of an overload,” Maresca said.
End-of-season fatigue has been cited as a factor, as have the searing temperatures and the fact Chelsea had an extra day to prepare for the final. The PSG players have expended a lot of physical and mental energy over this 65-game campaign, but Chelsea’s season has lasted 64 games and they had to contend with the same conditions, described as “dangerous” by Enzo Fernández before the match.
Luis Enrique was not in search of excuses. “Over the course of the match, they deserved the win,” said the Spaniard, who recognised his opponent’s superiority on the day. “We aren’t losers. We didn’t fail. There was a champion. We fell but the loser is the one who doesn’t get up.”
The Spaniard had, nonetheless, lost his cool moments earlier, involved in what he described as an “avoidable” altercation with Pedro post-match. He, like his players – notably João Neves, who was sent off for a pull on Marc Cucurella’s hair – were all suddenly bereft of the composure that characterised their serene run to the Champions League trophy, superhumans rendered human once more.
So have Chelsea set the blueprint of how to beat PSG? Champions League-level sides may be wise to ditch the passive, defensive and submissive approach adopted by many last season. Fight quality with quality, if you can. But there is a quality imbalance in Ligue 1 and one that is only being widened. PSG are the only team truly immune to the financial problems gripping the domestic game and the €116m earned over their Club World Cup run only strengthens their financial situation.
Ligue 1 sides have spent only €160m so far this summer and more than half of that has been on signing players who were already at clubs on loan last season. PSG are yet to make their move in the transfer window, but they soon will – Nasser Al-Khelaifi has confirmed as much.
Ligue 1 sides cannot fight quality with quality; low blocks, the likes of which Les Parisiens face week-in week-out, will still be seen as the way to attempt to level an uneven playing field. While their French rivals may not lick their lips at the flaws laid bare in New Jersey, their European rivals will.

Football Daily | Cole Palmer conquers the world with a ‘so what’ shrug,Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now?

Not far from Football Daily Towers, nestled away on a quiet London street just around the corner from both the old Highbury and the new-ish Emirates Stadium, there once stood an Irish pub. It was a good one, named the Auld Triangle. It wasn’t a ‘beautiful’ place by any traditional yardstick, but still had original wood panelling dating back to its Victorian inception. It wasn’t particularly busy, apart from Arsenal matchdays, but its steady flow of regulars and opportunists convinced by its pretty exterior to step inside still created an atmosphere. It didn’t do food, but a friendly, monosyllabic man behind the bar would allow you to bring whatever takeaway grub you wanted into the pub, so long as you were drinking his fare. As recently as 2021, the Auld Triangle had Sky Sports, BT Sports, screen dedicated to GAA and horse racing, daily newspapers splayed out over a table in the corner and as recently as 2021, sold pints for less than a fiver. It never shouted, never made any TimeOut lists or went viral but it was, in many ways, the perfect pub and a 10/10 experience on almost every occasion.
The Auld Triangle is now a trendy gastropub named the Plimsoll. Admittedly, it is a very good gastropub, with those smoky interiors still intact. The smash burger there, ‘The Dexter’, is famous and means the place has been reviewed by almost everyone worth their salt, including Big Website and Grace Dent, who gave it an excellent write up. The Plimsoll is achingly hip but the thing is – and Dent and co won’t know this – it is definitely an inferior place to the Auld Triangle, with Guinness that takes an age to fetch from the busy and understaffed bar, full of patrons who are absolutely desperate to split the G. The point to this indulgent and rather overwritten intro is that things don’t have to be showy to be the best. Cole Palmer is the embodiment of that, somehow both elite and low-key, the sort of man who looks like he came into this world shrugging his shoulders, as if to say, “so what”. There is no image or branding just an understated man who is both an awkward customer and one of the best footballers on the planet.
Prior to his match-winning two goals and one assist against PSG, Palmer started the Copa Gianni final weekend by solo scooting through New York City in a hoodie, trying to keep a low-profile in rolling through a packed Times Square like he was still a teenager on Wythenshawe high street and, after putting in another player-of-the-match performance against PSG, finished the weekend by attempting to elbow the president of the USA USA USA out of the way during Chelsea’s trophy presentation. In a moment of unassuming comic timing, Palmer appears to mouth “What’s he doing?!” as Donald Trump refuses to get off the stage, obscuring Palmer from view as Reece James hoists the trophy aloft. “I was a bit confused, yeah,” sighed Palmer afterwards.
Low-key off the pitch, then, and low profile on it, as PSG consistently struggled to identify just where Palmer had got to during the final. Against a team famous for their pressing, Palmer found space time and again, and was typically modest in crediting Enzo Maresca for Chelsea’s success. “The gaffer put a great gameplan out,” Palmer said. “He knew where the space was going to be. He tried to free me up as much as possible and I just had to repay him and score some goals.” Two identical no-fuss finishes put Chelsea 2-0 up, with Palmer beating the best goalkeeper in the world, Gianluigi Donnarumma, with a side-footed finish from 20 yards like it was the easiest thing in the world. No stepovers, no flicks, no tricks. And so, at a football tournament that felt very much like an expensive gastropub, here’s to Cole Palmer, here’s to understatement. Football Daily is sure he would have loved the stripped-back, world-class basics of the Auld Triangle, not making smalltalk with the man behind the bar, eating his Chinese takeaway and Chippy Chips with his reasonably priced drink.
QUOTE OF THE DAY
What was presented as a global celebration of football was nothing more than a fiction created by Fifa, promoted by its president, without dialogue, sensitivity, and respect for those who sustain the game with their daily efforts. A grandiloquent staging inevitably reminiscent of the ‘bread and circuses’ of Nero’s Rome, entertainment for the masses while behind the scenes inequality, precariousness, and the lack of protection for the true protagonists deepen” – Fifpro president, Sergio Marchi, sharpens his studs and takes a two-footed leap at Gianni Infantino.
FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS
I read Arsène Wenger’s comments about the Club World Cup with a mixture of laughter and increasing incredulity. As a Spurs fan of 78 years and counting I was well accustomed to his poor eyesight at red card incidents and your quoted ‘dubious decisions’ but this latest effort takes the biscuit. To think that he is trousering a considerable amount of money as Fifa’s so called director of world football development merely confirms my opinion of the [snip]show that is Fifa” – Stewart McGuinness.
Well I, for one, am glad of the Copa Gianni. I have managed to prove to myself (if no one else) that I am not obsessed with football and there are some tournaments even I would not stoop to watch” – Alex Folkes.
Looked at livesoccertv.com for friendlies on Saturday. There are THREE HUNDRED of them. That’s 600 different teams named on the list, mostly European. Amazing!” – Jim Geissman.
‘At the same time, there is now a penumbra of leagues outside the elite’. Penumbra! Never change Jonathan Wilson, never change …” Noble Francis.
