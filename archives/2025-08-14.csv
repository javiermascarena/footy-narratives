Frank: Spurs showed we can take on anyone,"Thomas Frank vowed Spurs showed they can take on ""anyone in the world"" after their penalty shoot-out defeat to PSG in the Super Cup.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13411363/thomas-frank-says-tottenham-can-take-on-anyone-in-the-world-after-narrow-super-cup-defeat-to-psg,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 23:14:00",Ron Walker,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Thomas Frank vowed Spurs showed they can take on ""anyone in the world"" after their penalty shoot-out defeat to PSG in the Super Cup.
Spurs had led the Champions League winners 2-0 with five minutes remaining before a painful late collapse which culminated in Nuno Mendes' winner from 12 yards after Micky Van de Ven and Mathys Tel had missed their spot kicks.
PSG had shown the full effect of only returning to training last week following their Club World Cup exploits in July but Spurs' resilience and work off the ball, as well as their impact from set-pieces - which produced both their goals - put them on the verge of a second trophy in three months until that capitulation.
""I think we played a very good game against one of the best teams in the world, maybe the best,"" Frank told TNT Sports after the match.
""We had them exactly where we wanted them for 80-somethimg minutes until 2-1. Then it shifted the momentum but I'm so proud of the team, players, club and fans.
""We showed we can be adaptable and pragmatic. We needed to be that against a team like PSG, with the way we wanted to defend with both high pressure and a low block. The first half was almost perfect and the set-pieces were very dangerous.
""In one game, I think we have shown we can play against any team in the world. I'm not in doubt about that and that's a positive to take away from this.""
The manner of Spurs' defeat may prove more chastening for Frank's players than the result itself, with PSG clear favourites going into Wednesday's game in Udine.
The Spurs boss championed a '24-hour' policy at former club Brentford where players and staff had a day to get a result out of their system before moving on to the next game.
In Tottenham's case, that begins less than three days after full-time in Italy when they host Burnley in their Premier League opener at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, kick-off 3pm.
""I have a rule for 24 hours, it's a short turnaround but there'll be a bit of disappointment for 24 hours,"" he confirmed.
""Then tomorrow [Thursday] afternoon we'll be ready, Friday we'll be more ready and then we make sure we're ready to come flying out at the weekend.""
Analysis from Sky Sports' Adam Bate in Udine:
""The Tottenham supporters had shuffled out by the time that Paris Saint-Germain lifted the trophy. But the Spurs players had to stand and applaud knowing that they were close to claiming it themselves. Painfully close.
""There was so much to admire about Tottenham's determined performance in a game that pitted them against the Champions League winners - and now UEFA Super Cup winners.
""Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero did more than just shackle the formidable PSG attack for much of the match, they scored the goals that put Spurs on the brink of a memorable victory in Udine.
""Thomas Frank's fingerprints were all over it. Two goals from set-pieces. Kevin Danso hurling in long throws from right and left.
""Ahead of them, Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and particularly Pape Sarr worked constantly to protect the defence. Pedro Porro's positioning allowed Spurs to shift from a back four to a back five.
""Supporters will be encouraged by what they saw from Mohammed Kudus too but this was never going to be a game to showcase the more expansive side of their game.
""In truth, Frank does not have the players to do so right now. It was only weeks ago that fans were weighing up how to accommodate Morgan Gibbs-White and James Maddison. Now they are without a natural No 10.
""The best that they could hope for after a humbling pre-season defeat to Bayern Munich was to show some resolve and they certainly looked like a team playing for each other. The great pity for Tottenham is that PSG just beat the clock to beat them.
""Fabian Ruiz brought real balance in midfield after coming on, dictating proceedings thereafter, while Lee Kang-In showed the composure that was needed in the final third. Ousmane Dembele's change of position was also key to the equaliser.
""Even the shoot-out mirrored the match, with Spurs racing into a 2-0 lead only to see it wiped out. It was a performance full of heart even if the fans in Udine will feel frustrated that their team were pushed so deep that they could not control the final minutes.
""It is a quick turnaround before facing Burnley on Saturday in what will be a game that will test Frank in very different ways.
""Players and supporters could be forgiven for feeling a little flat going into it. This trophy was almost theirs, after all. But unlike Inter in the Champions League final, they were close to beating PSG. Painfully close.""

Liverpool agree deal to sign defender Leoni,Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Parma defender Giovanni Leoni.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13411305/giovanni-leoni-transfer-news-liverpool-agree-deal-to-sign-parma-defender,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 20:31:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Parma defender Giovanni Leoni.
An agreement was reached late on Wednesday night and the fee for the 18-year-old defender is £26m plus add-ons.
Leoni now has permission to travel to Liverpool to agree personal terms and undergo a medical, which is expected to begin on Thursday.
Liverpool saw off competition from elite Italian clubs and Premier League sides, with the player adamant his choice was a move to Arne Slot's side.
Leoni will also immediately join the first-team set-up for this season, with any suggestion of a loan move completely ruled out.
Liverpool were targeting reinforcements at centre-back with Ibrahima Konate entering the final year of his deal at Anfield.
It is looking likely that Marc Guehi will stay at Crystal Palace and leave on a free transfer next summer.
Liverpool are still in talks for Palace's captain, but there is a gap in valuation.
Palace will not let their captain go on the cheap and Liverpool know they can wait until next summer to sign him on a free transfer. The question is whether Liverpool can negotiate a fee now or wait until next year.
Guehi, meanwhile, is happy to stay at Palace and play in Europe. If Palace were to agree a fee with Liverpool then he would be happy to talk to them but that has not happened.
Multiple big clubs in the Premier League and across Europe are aware that Guehi may be available as a free agent next summer.
Liverpool's £26m deal to Leoni is set to take the Reds' spending above £300m this summer.
Leoni will be the sixth major signing for Arne Slot's Premier League champions this season - with their business set to come to £321.5m in paid transfer fees so far.
That fee is currently the third-biggest transfer outlay from a Premier League club in a single window.
And if Liverpool complete a deal to sign Alexander Isak, which could cost well above £100m - then the Reds could become the biggest summer transfer spenders of all time.

"More depth, fewer excuses: Arsenal and Arteta have nowhere to hide now","Mikel Arteta was asked this summer what his long-term plans for Arsenal are. ""There is no long,"" he replied. ""It's short, it's now.""",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13410557/arsenal-are-more-prepared-for-the-premier-league-season-but-can-mikel-arteta-finally-deliver-a-title,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 22:30:00",Sam Blitz,['Arsenal'],"Mikel Arteta was asked this summer what his long-term plans for Arsenal are. ""There is no long,"" he replied. ""It's short, it's now.""
For so long the Spaniard had deemed his tenure as a drawn-out design. 'Trust the process' became the slogan around Arsenal - especially in the tougher times. ""This project will go bang,"" said Arteta in at the start of 2021.
Even last season, Arteta admitted they were in phase four out of his five-phase plan to create a dynasty at the north London club. Process, project, plan - the end goal was always a little further away from view.
Not anymore. Rival fans rejoice in their shortcomings, Arsenal fans are running out of excuses and, as above, even Arteta now recognises one simple thing: the Gunners are now in the endgame when it comes to this era. This season could well define how this Arsenal team is remembered.
""They have to bring trophies next season,"" said Gary Neville back in May. ""There is no hiding place."" And with Arteta's Arsenal being compared to Maurico Pochettino's Spurs or Gareth Southgate's England - both eras entertaining yet trophyless - there is no more margin for a lack of silverware.
Arsenal have spent three years sitting as one of the top two teams in the country but have nothing to show for it. It has provoked an aggressive transfer window that the club has not seen in the modern era. They even went and signed a striker.
Under new sporting director Andrea Berta, Arsenal made six summer signings overall before the end of their pre-season tour of Asia. Since the Gunners started going on regular, marquee pre-season camps every year - which began in 2010 - it is the most signings they have ever made before the end of their travels.
The only times Arsenal made more than three signings before the end of a tour came three years ago - when they propelled themselves from top-four hopefuls to title contenders - and the summer after Arsene Wenger's departure, which needed a rebuild.
It could be argued that Arsenal are more prepared than ever before for a new season. That Berta has delivered on the 'win now' mentality that many thought he would bring. And if those arguments are fair, it means the excuses are now minimal for Arsenal. If not that, then non-existent.
Arsenal have fixed a depth issue that has plagued them in recent seasons, including the last one. Bukayo Saka was an irreplaceable cog on the right wing but when he picked up a near-four-month injury last season, the Gunners most successful deputy in that position was then-17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri.
The teenager was also the only like-for-like back-up to Martin Odegaard when the Arsenal captain picked up a six-week injury last September.
""Let's be real, last year we hardly had any depth in any areas,"" said Declan Rice while on Arsenal's pre-season tour.
""We played half the season, pretty much, with so many injuries, so to now be able to rotate and push in different competitions with different players is going to be really good. That's key for us.""
But barring another injury crisis, a Saka setback for Arsenal would now allow Noni Madueke to slot in on the right. Odegaard's back-up is still Nwaneri - on paper - but a more experienced Nwaneri after last season's emergence into the first-team.
Viktor Gyokeres' arrival also means Kai Havertz could also drop into attacking midfield without losing a key cog up front, while Mikel Merino and Declan Rice being exposed to more attacking roles last season means Odegaard has more cover - no matter if a move for Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze is completed before then.
""Now we're going to have the capacity as well to decide who is in the best condition to play this game hopefully,"" added Arteta on Arsenal's Asia tour. ""Because last year? No.
""Last year the line up was: 'Give me five players who can finish 90 minutes.' Those five? Ok, those I have to play. 'Now give me another five who can do [less] and then…' and we played like this for seven months.
""We need to get away from that, because those restrictions have limited our capacity to perform and then have the freshness that we need at the end of the season.
""Hopefully this season is going to be very different, and we can decide what is the best team with the best players to play against this opponent. And then if we want to change the game or the team - whatever the context is, winning, drawing or losing - we can change it immediately and have those players that can impact the result.""
Liverpool may have stolen all the transfer window headlines with one of the biggest spending Premier League sprees of all time, Arsenal have had an unprecedented summer themselves.
Not only have they made more signings than ever before but they have addressed what Arteta and the wider football community wanted from them. The Arsenal manager wanted numbers to fill up a ""short"" squad.
""The manager needs arming with a couple of really good forwards,"" said Neville. ""If he gets that they've got a real chance."" In come Gyokeres and Madueke. ""They need someone of high quality to go in that midfield area,"" he added. Zubimendi looks a talent in that role.
Arsenal have answered a lot of cries this summer. The only question is whether a summer like no other can bring a season like none of the last 20 years.

Multiple big clubs in the Premier League and across Europe are aware that Guehi may be available as a free agent next summer.
Newcastle are not expected to be in the race for Guehi after signing centre-back Malick Thiaw with AC Milan.
Tottenham, who had a bid for Guehi rejected in the winter window, are in the market for a defender this summer, but their priority at this stage is bringing in a winger and a No 10.
Liverpool are also closing in on the signing of teenage centre-back Giovanni Leoni from Parma.
The Premier League champions are expected to pay an initial £26m for the 18-year-old.
Liverpool need more experience at centre-back and Ibrahima Konate is entering the final year of his deal.
Sky Sports' Paul Merson on further transfer business for Liverpool: ""If I were Liverpool, I'd be looking more for a centre-back than signing Alexander Isak. Arne Slot has enough options going forward without needing Isak.""Hugo Ekitike looked very good against Crystal Palace. They desperately need another defender.""I hear a lot of people saying that if Liverpool get Isak, it's game over in the Premier League. It's finished. I don't see that at all.""It causes more problems, if anything. Where does Cody Gakpo play? There's Florian Wirtz, Mo Salah and then Ekitike.""If Isak arrives, they can't all play. Slot will have to mix things up and change things constantly to keep everyone happy and that causes problems.""
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
Marc Guehi has established himself as one of the Premier League's elite centre-backs. The 25-year-old is first-choice for England and, after leading Crystal Palace to back-to-back trophy successes at Wembley, looks like an absolute bargain signing at around £40m.
Liverpool have opened talks with Palace, whose chairman Steve Parish admitted it makes sense to cash in if the one year left on Guehi's contract can't be extended. Guehi is also believed to be open to an Anfield switch and Reds boss Arne Slot is in need of defensive reinforcements.
But while that all adds up, where Guehi would actually fit into Liverpool's team is not quite so straightforward.
Guehi plays on the left of a back three at Crystal Palace. He has shown with England he can play on the left side of a back four - the preferred set-up at Liverpool and of Slot - but that is where captain Virgil van Dijk plays. The Dutchman started 37 of 38 Premier League games last season.
The assumption seems to be that Guehi would play alongside Van Dijk, in place of Ibrahima Konate, who only has a year to run on his own Liverpool deal. Being a right-footer, it's not a huge leap for Guehi but does require some adaptation - and breaks up a championship-winning partnership.
With Van Dijk aged 34 and Konate's contract situation uncertain, Guehi would future-proof the Liverpool defence. But does he want to risk being a back-up or rotation option at Liverpool in a World Cup year?
A creative alternative could be for Slot to turn to an unfamiliar back three, with Guehi remaining in his favoured left-side role, Van Dijk orchestrating affairs from the centre, and Konate protecting the right channel, as he is skilled to do.
That could also help rebalance a Liverpool defence which Slot admitted needed ""adjustment"" after they were opened up through pre-season, with the adventurous new signings Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong leaving the centre-backs vulnerable.
Any which way, it requires a shift from Guehi or Liverpool - but it could be a conundrum both the player and Premier League champions believe is worth taking on.

Work to do as Spurs collapse - but promising signs for Frank,Tottenham were left feeling low after the Super Cup slipped from their grasp against Paris St-Germain - but there are still reasons for new head coach Thomas Frank to be upbeat.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c70xjww01pjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 22:46:38",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"It looked like being a dream debut for Tottenham boss Thomas Frank.
Leading 2-0 with little more than five minutes remaining against European champions Paris St-Germain, surely the Super Cup was on its way to north London.
Not so. A stirring comeback from the Parisians and a shootout win stopped Spurs from becoming the first Europa League winners to lift the Super Cup since 2018.
But the Dane's fingerprints were all over this Tottenham performance, which showed promising signs for 85 minutes.
Set-pieces? Check. Pragmatism? Check. Efficiency? Check.
""I think we played a very good game against one of the best teams in the world, maybe the best at this moment in time,"" said Frank, who replaced Ange Postecoglou as manager this summer.
""We had them exactly where we wanted them for 80 or so minutes. Then the momentum changed with the 2-1 goal. The team and fans have a lot to be proud of.
""The first half was almost perfect and obviously set-pieces were very good and we were very dangerous.
""At times I think we showed that we can play up against any team in the world.""

What did we learn about Frank's Tottenham?
There's work to be done for Tottenham; their late collapse was evidence of that.
Indeed, it should concern Frank that his team wilted at the first sign of pressure against a side who have had just two pre-season training sessions in the bag.
But for the vast majority of this Uefa Super Cup meeting that ultimately ended in penalty heartache, there were enough signs to suggest Frank has the basis of a system and approach that can be built on.
His 3-5-2 formation was certainly a move away from last season's set up but you get the feeling Frank will be flexible depending on the challenge in the coming months, something his predecessor was often accused of not being.
Inside the opening 10 minutes, the approach was entirely noticeable. Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario kicked long five times as Tottenham opted to keep their shape higher up the pitch rather than collect the ball deep inside their own half and pass their way up the field.
Ange Postecoglou's high-risk approach was easy on the eye but the final 18 months of his reign at Tottenham - despite that euphoric Europa League win in Bilbao last May - told us the Australian's methods weren't working.
This was a Tottenham performance less to do with capturing the imagination than capturing the victory.
For example, Postecoglou was maligned for a perceived lack of attention to detail in regard to preparing for set-pieces.
It was significant, then, that both of Tottenham's goals arrived via dead balls.
Expect Frank's Tottenham to excel at set-pieces in their own penalty box, too.
His Brentford side conceded only three Premier League goals from set-pieces (excluding penalties) last season - three fewer than any other team in the division.
Offensively, Brentford were also one of the strongest. Only four teams - Arsenal (14), Crystal Palace, Aston Villa (both 16) and Nottingham Forest (17) - scored from more Premier League set-pieces last season.
Here in Udine, there were clear indicators that Spurs will develop such strength in the coming months.
This was an effective Tottenham display rather than an enchanting one.
Frank said: ""I knew we had to do something different against PSG. It was a special operation. And 2-2 against PSG, I think you take that - that single result is good.
""In spells, we went more direct as we knew we could hurt them. There was focus on set-pieces, but there will always be a focus on set-pieces.
""High pressure is a non-negotiable. We went man for man in some aspects.""
There was a time when the style of play mattered to Tottenham fans. Ask Jose Mourinho. Ask Antonio Conte.
Both received criticism from supporters for their pragmatic styles. Tottenham's traditions for producing attacking teams still carries weight to this day. It will be interesting to see if supporters get on Frank's back for his tactical approach if things start to falter.
But winning football matches, regardless of style, will be his priority, as it will be for the chairman Daniel Levy.
Spurs seek more in transfer market
Tottenham debutants Joao Palhinha and Mohamed Kudus both showed promising signs in Italy.
Kudus, in particular, was excellent - his pace and power created problems for PSG's rearguard throughout.
Yet Tottenham still have work to do in the transfer market before the window closes on 1 September.
Spurs are looking at offensive reinforcements. They are in club-to-club talks over moves for Manchester City winger Savinho and Crystal Palace attacking midfielder Eberechi Eze.
They are also after a centre-back before the deadline, but their first choice target Marc Guehi seems out of reach at the moment.
If Tottenham can sign two high-quality attackers and a defender before the window closes, then that would represent a successful summer in the market.
There are holes in Frank's squad that still need plugging. Tottenham are trying to rectify that.
If they don't, then expect disgruntled supporters, irked by the club's lack of business so far, to make their thoughts heard.
'A real blow' - what did the pundits say?
Former Tottenham and England keeper Paul Robinson, talking to BBC Radio 5 Live: In the next 24-48 hours, Thomas Frank has to go back to the training ground, unpack it, show the players video of everything they did well and put the belief back into them.
I think this will be damaging for Tottenham, I really do. You can see the players standing on the pitch separately in little huddles and on their own. They are absolutely devastated.
They got the trophy that they had been longing for last season and this could have been a real step forward for Tottenham. Instead it's a real blow.
Former Spurs winger Aaron Lennon on BBC Radio 5 Live: You can see that the Tottenham players are hurting. As a player you know games you should win and this was one of them.
Five minutes to go, 2-0 up, see it out. Even when it goes to 2-1, you've got to know how to see a game out.
Tottenham didn't handle that well enough.
I still think Tottenham need a few players in. There are links with Eberechi Eze and Savinho. Losing James Maddison [to injury] and Son Heung-min is huge for this football club - two big players and big characters and leaders, and lots of goals and assists.
Former Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy talking to BBC Sport: Tottenham went man for man and gained control with their discipline. It has to be done perfectly and you can see they have worked on it.
The good thing for Tottenham was even when they dropped deep they were OK. There were a lot of good things for Tottenham fans from that first half.
Set-plays were a big part of Frank's Brentford last season and I think that will be a good thing for Tottenham this season.
I think to get back into the European places and have a good run in the Champions League, that would be realistic. I think there is lots to look forward to: better competition for places, younger players with more experience and there are still a few weeks left in the window.

Spurs condemn 'cowards' for racially abusing Tel,"Tottenham say they are ""disgusted"" by the racial abuse received by Mathys Tel following their defeat by Paris St-Germain in the Uefa Super Cup.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cly6gw46504o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Thu, 14 Aug 2025 06:52:28",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have said they are ""disgusted"" by the racial abuse received by forward Mathys Tel following their defeat by Paris St-Germain in the Uefa Super Cup.
The club, who lost 4-3 on penalties after letting slip a two-goal lead, said people who had sent abusive messages to Tel on social media were ""nothing but cowards"".
Tel, 20, came on as a substitute in the 79th minute and was one of two Spurs players who failed to convert from the spot in the penalty shootout.
""Mathys showed bravery and courage to step forward and take a penalty, yet those who abuse him are nothing but cowards - hiding behind anonymous usernames and profiles to spout their abhorrent views,"" Tottenham said.
""We will work with the authorities and social media platforms to take the strongest possible action against any individual we are able to identify.
""We stand with you, Mathys.""
Spurs' statement comes after England defender Jess Carter revealed she had been the target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 last month.
As a result, the Lionesses stopped the anti-racism gesture of taking a knee before matches as they argued it was ""clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism"".
On Tuesday, Carter said she feared her England team-mate Lauren James would suffer ""astronomical"" racist abuse if she had been the only player to have missed a penalty in their Euro quarter-final shootout against Sweden.
Europa League winners Tottenham led 2-0 after 84 minutes and were minutes away from claiming their second trophy in three months before PSG fought back, levelling the match when Goncalo Ramos headed in a 94th-minute equaliser.
Spurs defender Micky van de Ven saw his spot-kick saved before Frenchman Tel sent his shot wide. Nuno Mendes held his nerve to convert the winning penalty for PSG.
Tottenham signed Tel on a permanent deal, worth around £30m, in June after he joined the club on loan in January.
He made 20 appearances for the club last season, scoring three goals and was an unused substitute for their victory over Manchester United in the Europa League final.

Liverpool closing in on £26m deal for Parma teenager Leoni,Liverpool are closing in on the signing of 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee of about £26m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9wyvjl2ky4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 20:19:43",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool are closing in on the signing of 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee of about £26m.
The centre-half has emerged as a key target for Arne Slot's side and is now set for a move to Anfield.
The Italy Under-19s international began his career at Padova and had a short spell at Sampdoria before joining Parma last summer.
Liverpool could further bolster their defensive ranks and remain in talks with Crystal Palace for England centre-back Marc Guehi.
FA Cup winners Palace are believed to want £40m for their captain, who only has 12 months left on his contract, but Liverpool want to pay less than that.
Eagles chairman Steve Parish said earlier this week Guehi might be sold to avoid him moving on a free transfer next summer.
If the clubs do agree a deal, the level of playing time he would be afforded at Liverpool will be a crucial consideration for Guehi in a World Cup year.
The Reds have already spent about £270m this summer, though they have recouped about £170m through player sales.
They have also had a £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle, though sources have told BBC Sport the Swede remains determined to move to the Premier League champions.
Signing Leoni, Guehi and Isak would take Liverpool's summer spending past £400m.
'A huge opportunity' for Leoni - analysis
Giovanni Leoni is very strong in the air. He's a technically gifted player as well. He can come out from defence and start building from the back, but he's obviously at his most impactful in the air. He's improved a lot in that area too.
A couple of big clubs in Italy, including AC Milan and Inter Milan, were also after him. So I didn't expect a bold move from a Premier League club so early, to be honest. But Liverpool put the money on the table - probably even a bit more than Parma were originally asking for.
Who wouldn't fancy playing Anfield? I think any player would be happy to join Liverpool - and, of course, the Premier League, which is the most entertaining and attractive league in the world right now.
I would have loved to see Giovanni join a big Italian club before moving abroad. But that's football - the market is open. If a club like Liverpool comes in with 30m euros plus bonuses, it's difficult to turn down such an offer.
It will be difficult for him to start regularly - he knows that. But I don't think that's a major problem at his age.
Having the opportunity to be part of such a strong squad and play alongside great players, especially someone like Virgil van Dijk, is a huge opportunity.

'A brutal call' - why Chevalier replaced 'best in world' Donnarumma,Lucas Chevalier passes the test as he replaces Gianluigi Donnarumma in the Paris-St Germain goal in their Super Cup victory against Tottenham.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1jnz3p2xr2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 23:08:23",Charlotte Coates,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Paris St-Germain head coach Luis Enrique made a ""brutal call"" in replacing Gianluigi Donnarumma with Lucas Chevalier as the European champions move away from an ""older-style goalkeeper"".
Despite his heroics last season as the club won the Champions League, Italian Donnarumma was dropped for Wednesday's Super Cup meeting with Tottenham - and made available for transfer with one year left on his contract.
Chevalier, signed from Lille earlier this week, has been handed the starting role and helped PSG overcome Tottenham on penalties following a dramatic 2-2 draw in Udine.
Luis Enrique said the decision was ""100%"" his as the PSG boss opted for a ""different profile"" of goalkeeper in the 23-year-old Chevalier.
While Donnarumma's saves were crucial in helping the French side to glory in May as they thrashed Inter Milan 5-0, he has often been criticised for his ability with the ball at his feet.
French football journalist Julien Laurens said ""without Gianluigi Donnarumma, I don't think PSG win the Champions League"".
Yet he also understood why they went ""with someone different"" as he told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""They have made a call, a brutal call. Lucas Chevalier is better on the ball, better in the air, better with distribution, but he doesn't have the experience.
""All eyes were on him as he replaces probably the best goalkeeper in the world right now.""
Who is Chevalier & what does he offer?
In making a decision that has surprised many in world football, Luis Enrique believes Chevalier will improve PSG even more, especially with his team's playing style.
The French keeper has been likened to a five-a-side player because of the quality of his touch, vision and ability to break lines with his passing from the back.
Chevalier can effectively turn into an outfield player for PSG when in possession as they look to build an attack from their own defensive line.
Replacing Donnarumma will be tough, but he stepped up successfully as Lille's first choice in the 2022-23 season after just a season in Ligue 2 with Valenciennes. Pressure should not be an issue.
Chevalier was named Ligue 1's best goalkeeper last term with 11 clean sheets as his side finished fifth, while earning a call-up to France's senior squad.
Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The goalkeeper situation is a huge decision from Luis Enrique. Gianluigi Donnarumma is the best shot stopper and he is the best version of the older-style goalkeeper, but they have been replaced by the modern-day keeper who play in the defensive third.
""Luis Enrique is leaning into the way that modern teams want to play and build from the back. PSG are looking for that ninth degree, that tiny little bit of percentage of advantage and with Lucas Chevalier they feel they can further refine their style.""
Signs of what Chevalier will bring were seen during his debut against Spurs, with PSG opting to go short on goal-kicks and showing no fear when using him in general play.
He should have done better with Cristian Romero's header that put the Premier League side 2-0 ahead, but showed great reflexes in a stunning save to push Joao Palhinha's effort on to the bar, although Micky van de Ven netted the rebound for Spurs' opener.
Chevalier then stopped Van de Ven's penalty in the shootout as PSG won after a superb comeback in normal time from 2-0 down.
It was a bold move by Luis Enrique to turn to the Frenchman, but one that could prove a masterstroke in the future if Chevalier lives up to great expectations.
Why is Donnarumma going?
But why would a goalkeeper, favourite to be crowned the world's best this year, be frozen out like this?
Luis Enrique has said he wanted a ""different profile"" to what Donnarumma gave his side.
Before the Super Cup, the PSG boss clarified it was ""100%"" his decision to cut Italy's first-choice stopper from his squad, with Donnarumma ""disappointed and disheartened"" by the outcome.
The 26-year-old arrived from AC Milan on a free transfer in 2021 and enhanced his reputation in Paris.
But with football continuing to evolve, goalkeepers are not just shot stoppers, but are also used as deep-lying playmakers to open up a new dimension of play. This is why Ederson has proved so valuable for Manchester City.
Pep Guardiola's side have been linked with Donnarumma, but Laurens said he is ""not a Pep Guardiola-type of keeper"".
""Manchester City are the only club in for Gianluigi Donnarumma at the moment,"" he added. ""I'm amazed by it. But he is not good in the air and not great on the ball.""

'High stakes game of poker' - Newcastle 'together' despite Isak saga,"Alexander Isak remains determined to leave Newcastle United to join Liverpool but Eddie Howe hopes to ""use any adversity or challenge to our benefit"".",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gjj0jgy5eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 18:12:30",Ciaran Kelly,['Liverpool'],"It is not every day that Mickey and Minnie Mouse rock up at Newcastle United's training ground.
But this was not your typical afternoon at the club's Benton base.
A barbecue had been arranged for the players and their young families before the new season.
The words ""better together"" may have been signposted inside the canteen, but there was a notable absentee.
Alexander Isak was nowhere to be seen.
'A high stakes game of poker'
As much as Eddie Howe would love to be able to call upon Isak, the Newcastle head coach said it was ""clear at the moment that we can't involve him in the group"".
Isak remains determined to leave Newcastle and join Liverpool.
But Newcastle have stood firm, rejecting a £110m bid from the champions earlier this month.
Should that come as a surprise?
After all, what sort of message would it send to sell Isak to Liverpool?
What precedent could it set for other Newcastle players given that Isak still has three years left on his contract?
How would Newcastle even go about finding a worthy replacement, particularly so late in the window?
But could Isak really be reintegrated one day?
This situation is a ""complicated mix of employer/employee relations and the specificity of sport"" in the words of Dan Chapman, the partner and head of employment and sports teams at Leathes Prior.
""Contractually Newcastle are likely to be well within their rights to insist that Isak trains away from the first team and are absolutely entitled to hold him to his contract and reject any advances from Liverpool,"" the lawyer said.
""However, balanced against that is a compelling commercial reality which is that he is a very expensive player to be paying if not involved with the first team - and if they refuse to sell him this window and do not play him, his market value will only diminish.
""For that reason, we often see that the so-called player power will be perceived to win out in the end, though Newcastle will be trying to ensure that, if they are going to end up selling the player, they absolutely maximise the value they receive.
""They will also want Isak to recognise that if he did end up spending this season as no more than a fringe player, he would be harming his own value and, potentially, entering a World Cup year in less than ideal conditions.
""Though legally Newcastle hold most of the cards here, in practical terms, the player in a situation like this will often believe he also maintains a very strong hand, and how these situations finally play out resembles a very high stakes game of poker.""
Group has been disrupted
High stakes, indeed.
There has been an acknowledgement behind the scenes that a tight-knit group have been ""disrupted"" ""during an ""unsettling"" period without their talisman.
But experienced defender Kieran Trippier vowed ""we are together"" and those words have been echoed by Howe.
""The group has been together,"" the Newcastle head coach insisted. ""Since the moment I stepped through the door, we had our challenges.
""We had big mountains to climb on the pitch, but we were always united off it. It's been one of our biggest strengths and that's why we have been successful.
""It doesn't mean that we can't overcome this and come back even stronger. I have to work really hard with a group of players who will fight and give everything for the football club so that we use any adversity or challenge to our benefit.""
It will likely fall to winger Anthony Gordon to lead the line against Aston Villa on Saturday because of a lack of senior alternatives up front.
That had never been part of the plan, but the same could be said of these past couple of months in general on Tyneside.
Last summer was challenging enough after Newcastle had to dash to raise funds to avoid a breach of profit and sustainability rules (PSR).
But it is rather telling that club insiders believe this has been an even more difficult window.
'Anything can happen when Howe is in charge'
Where do you even begin?
There has been further boardroom upheaval following the departure of sporting director Paul Mitchell while chief executive Darren Eales is serving his notice.
Newcastle have also missed out on several transfer targets, including Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and James Trafford.
These pursuits have highlighted the challenge Newcastle face to compete with clubs such as Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United, who have superior wage bills and a greater legacy of success.
It has left fans concerned.
Thomas Concannon, who helps plan the huge flag displays before home games, admitted it was ""hard not to be a little bit nervous and down"" particularly with the Isak situation ""adding a big cloud of doubt over the whole project"".
But the Wor Flags volunteer still retains hope after the bulk of the squad helped the club qualify for the Champions League and end a long wait for silverware last season.
""The one thing you have learned with this team is that anything can happen when Eddie Howe is in charge,"" he said.
""Newcastle still have St James' behind them and a lot of things in their favour. I still think they can definitely do something.
""So many things have to go right to have a good season, but there's nothing to say it can't happen - especially if they finish the transfer window on a high.""
That remains a big if before the window shuts on 1 September.
But Newcastle have made progress this week.
Newcastle announced the arrival of AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw and the club are in advanced negotiations with Aston Villa to sign midfielder Jacob Ramsey, having brought in Anthony Elanga and Aaron Ramsdale.
Newcastle also remain interested in Brentford striker Yoane Wissa, who would be viewed as a replacement for Callum Wilson, rather than as a successor to Isak.
It does not feel like all hope is lost. Not yet.

Will Man City replace Ederson with Donnarumma?,Will Manchester City move for Paris St-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma if Ederson leaves the club?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2xpzln34xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 13:54:31","Shamoon Hafez, Simon Stone and Nizaar Kinsella",['Manchester City'],"Gianluigi Donnarumma's career at Paris St-Germain appears to be over after he was left out of Wednesday's Uefa Super Cup final against Tottenham, following the signing of Lucas Chevalier from Lille.
So where does it leave a goalkeeper favourite to be crowned the world's best this year?
Manchester City sources are describing reports they are currently in talks with Donnarumma as speculation. They haven't completely ruled out a move - should City's current number one Ederson leave - and sources at PSG say they would not be surprised if that is where the Italy international eventually ends up.
The European champions did offer Donnarumma a new deal this summer, but on Tuesday head coach Luis Enrique explained that he is now looking for a ""different profile"" of goalkeeper.
The 26-year-old's agent Enzo Raiola explained that the Italy international offered to reduce his salary to stay in Paris.
That is a claim denied by those at the Parc des Princes, who believe the salary offered would have made Donnarumma one of the highest paid goalkeepers in the world.
Both sides now hope a transfer away can avoid any escalation in tension, and the French champions will want a fee to profit on what was a free transfer four years ago.
Will Ederson leave Man City?
City have four senior goalkeepers on their books, which is one too many, so it is somewhat of a surprise that they are being heavily linked with Donnarumma.
Reports suggested Pep Guardiola's side have agreed a deal to sign him, but sources close to Donnarumma have told BBC Sport this is not the case and that they have not spoken to City.
Ederson has been heavily linked with a move to Galatasaray but City sources have said they want the Brazilian to stay in Manchester and there have, so far, been no bids or interest.
The 31-year-old is entering the final year of his contract at Etihad Stadium and said at the Club World Cup in June that his ""future is here"".
That could change if the club were to receive an offer that is worth considering.
City's competition for the goalkeeping jersey is extremely healthy, with James Trafford coming in from Burnley and Marcus Bettinelli signed as third choice this summer.
It means Stefan Ortega's career at the club appears to be over, with City open to offers for the German goalkeeper, which would mean they would need to sign a replacement should Ederson depart too.
That road leads back to Donnarumma and although there has been no contact between the parties so far, it may change by the end of the month.
Does Donnarumma to Man City make sense?
How does Donnarumma compare to City's current crop of goalkeepers and would he fit in Guardiola's system?
His exclusion from Luis Enrique's plans is thought to be related to his ability with the ball at his feet, but Guardiola also requires his goalkeepers to be secure on the ball and initiate attacks.
Ederson is considered a great passer and has contributed a Premier League goalkeepers record eight assists in his time at the club, with four of those coming in the season just gone.
Donnarumma is yet to provide an assist but his passing accuracy in the French top flight stood at an impressive 85.4% last season, just below Ederson's Premier League percentage and above that of Ortega.
It is Donnarumma's save percentage of 66.2% that is perhaps surprising given his 6ft 5in frame. He kept only four clean sheets in 24 league starts and conceded almost four goals more than he should have according to Opta, with his goals prevented total -3.6.
He has posted better numbers in previous seasons and also during the 2024-25 Champions League campaign, in which he kept out more than 70% of shots faced. He has also kept out almost one in four penalties he has faced over his career.
Spanish football expert Guillem Balague said on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I am surprised Pep [Guardiola] considers Donnarumma as one of the top three goalkeepers in the world, because in the six-yard box he no doubt has something special, he sees things before the forward kicks the ball.
""But with his feet he is not the best, unless he thinks 'I can change that', which would be a Pep Guardiola way of thinking. It would be something he has to do as he saves and earns points for the team. I don't see him at that level, obviously Pep does, so if the opportunity arises they will get him.""
Man Utd or Chelsea for Donnarumma?
Manchester United always knew it was impossible to address all the shortcomings in Ruben Amorim's squad in one transfer window.
There were initial soundings around Aston Villa's World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez early in the summer but that didn't go anywhere and since then, United have maintained their focus on attacking positions.
Heading into the summer few expected the club to make three big-money signings without selling anyone significant. But now they have managed it, they do need to look at off-loading – and have essentially decided at present, any available finance will be directed at addressing the central midfield situation, not a new goalkeeper.
That situation is interesting anyway. Andre Onana is expected to be fit for Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal but his deputy Altay Bayindir has not made a move as anticipated after he was left out of the Europa League final starting line-up.
Veteran Tom Heaton has signed a one-year contract, so Amorim has experienced cover, while 21-year-old Radek Vitek and 19-year-old Elyh Harrison are very highly rated at Old Trafford and have just started loan spells at Bristol City and Shrewsbury respectively.
Meanwhile, sources deny speculation that Chelsea could look at signing Donnarumma this summer.
That's despite brief interest in AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan in June with Chelsea insistent that they will go into next season with Robert Sanchez as the number one option - as well as Filip Jorgensen as a capable back-up able to provide serious competition.

Why has the Man City 115 charges case taken so long?,BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team explains why the legal case between Man City and the Premier League is ongoing.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgvrz8zpvro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:08:17",Jonty Colman,['Manchester City'],"Manchester City and the Premier League are awaiting the verdict after a hearing into the 115 charges the club have faced since February 2023.
The charges relate to a number of alleged rule breaches by City between 2009 and 2018.
In an interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan on Wednesday, Premier League CEO Richard Masters said he stands by the legal process despite the costs involved and complexities of the case.
""There is no happy alternative to enforcing the rules, it goes to the integrity of the competition - it goes ultimately to value - and that principle shouldn't be defrayed in any way by being too difficult, too complex, or too costly,"" said Masters.
The number of charges and severity of the accusations are among the reasons the case has taken as long as it has.
""The word 'unprecedented' is often used more than it should be in the footballing world, but in this case it really is justified,"" said lawyer Simon Leaf, head of sport at Mishcon de Reya.
City's hearing started in September 2024 and lasted 10 weeks. In February 2025, manager Pep Guardiola said the club expected to learn the verdict ""within one month"".
Six months on, the outcome is yet to be made public.
""We have never seen anything like this type of case in the history of English football and arguably in world football,"" added Leaf.
""Given the scale of the allegations, the nature of the charges and the approach to handling the matter that each side has taken, most experts are not surprised that we are still waiting for a decision.""
What are Manchester City's 115 charges?
The 115 charges have been broken down to five different categories.
• 54x Failure to provide accurate financial information 2009-10 to 2017-18.
• 14x Failure to provide accurate details for player and manager payments from 2009-10 to 2017-18.
• 5x Failure to comply with Uefa's rules including Financial Fair Play (FFP) 2013-14 to 2017-18.
• 7x Breaching Premier League's PSR rules 2015-16 to 2017-18.
• 35x Failure to co-operate with Premier League investigations December 2018 - Feb 2023.
The lengths City went to in their defence appear to have prolonged matters.
""The legal teams involved... I'm pretty sure the Premier League has never come up against anything like this,"" said Yasin Patel - barrister at Church Court Chambers.
""The team of lawyers Manchester City have assembled... call it a super team if you want.
""There's a lot riding on it for the Premier League as well as Manchester City.""
There have been suggestions by the Times and football finance expert Kieran Maguire the number of charges is as high as 130.
""I think the Premier League will have been taken aback, as well as the arbitration panel really, how Manchester City have come with their defence,"" added Patel.
""They've been defending from right up front, attacking the Premier League in terms of their defence and making sure they've been aggressive in terms of what they've said the Premier League is wrong on.""
Why has the case taken so long?
A lot of football fans have drawn comparisons to the cases brought by the Premier League against Nottingham Forest and Everton respectively over breaches to Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).
During the 2023-24 season, both clubs were docked points for making more losses than they were permitted to for the three-year period from the 2020-21 to 2022-23 seasons.
Those cases were of a single charge, were easier to decipher and involved significantly less evidence.
""The Forest and Everton cases were, to a certain extent, very clear-cut. They were an open-and-shut case,"" said Maguire.
""There was 50,000 pieces of evidence put forward by both parties.
""In the case of Manchester City, you're going to have to multiply that by probably a factor of 10, so we could be looking at half a million pieces of evidence, which have to be reflected upon by the three people in the commission.
""They're also in demand in their own jobs so trying to get them around a table on a regular basis isn't necessarily easy and that's why eight months later we're still not really further down the road in terms of a conclusion to the evidence referral and then making a verdict.""
Earlier this month, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the process had ""gone on for far too long"".
In response, Masters told BBC Sport: ""The only point where I can speak publicly about it is when a decision has been handed down.
""I can't speculate about why or when, that's all I can say really. Daniel is not in the same position as me and I can't talk about it.""
When could we hear a verdict?
While there is frustration among many football supporters that a verdict has not been made public, those involved will know the importance of getting it right.
""The latest rumours, and they are nothing but rumours, is we could be waiting until around about October before a verdict,"" said Maguire.
""There has been a complete lockdown. There are no leaks. I think this is indicative of the level of professionalism of the people who are on the commission.""
Patel was clear a verdict would not be rushed.
He said: ""I suppose the public message from the panel will be: 'We are trying to get this decision as quickly as possible so we can get this over and done with.'
""None of the fans are going to believe that.
""No matter how much the fans jump up and down all around the country, I'm afraid no panel is going to be rushed.""
Patel also thinks the longer the wait, the ""better it is for Manchester City"".
""We all know what some of the potential penalties are, in particular points deductions, and I would have thought they would have given them by now,"" he added.
""The fact they haven't might suggest it's not as bad for Man City as people are predicting.""
Why the verdict will not be the end
Whoever comes out on top - be it the Premier League or Manchester City - it is almost certain the verdict will not bring the saga to an end.
If the Premier League wins, clubs who have perhaps lost titles or in cup competitions to City during the period covered by the charges may claim for loss of earnings, be it through prize money or competitions they failed to qualify for.
If City win, they could claim for damages caused as a result of the case.
""Whatever comes out of it, I'm afraid that's not the end of the title race for both parties here,"" said Patel. ""This is a two-horse race that's going to carry on.""
""Whatever verdict comes out, I wouldn't think that's the end of it. I would appeal, whether I was on one side or the other.""

"‘Very, very proud’: Thomas Frank hails Tottenham players after PSG defeat",Spurs take PSG to penalty shootout in Super Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/very-very-proud-thomas-frank-hails-tottenham-players-after-psg-defeat,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 22:58:18",Nick Ames,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Thomas Frank described himself as “very, very proud” of a Tottenham team that came within two minutes of a famous Uefa Super Cup win over Paris Saint-Germain. They were ultimately defeated on penalties after squandering a two-goal lead and their new manager was left to rue an inability to bend the outcome to their will in the shootout.
Goals from Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero appeared to have rocket-launched Frank’s tenure before Lee Kang-in and Gonçalo Ramos curtailed the celebrations. But the Dane saw plenty of encouragement in the way his players dominated their star-studded opponents for the first three quarters of the match.
“Very, very proud of the players, the team, the club, the fans,” he said. “I think the players gave everything against one of the best teams in the world, maybe the best. I think for 75 to 80 minutes we were perfect, almost ­giving nothing away.”
Tottenham were decisively undone when Van de Ven and Mathys Tel missed in the shootout but Frank was in no mood to apportion blame. “It’s down to the smallest of margins, like the flip of a coin,” he said. “I’d like to thank all the players who stepped up, were brave and took responsibility.”
Frank had set Spurs up with a back three and placed a heavy emphasis on set pieces, which they practised in the warm-up and deployed effectively for both goals. It recalled some of his best work with Brentford but he said the tactics had been honed specifically to trouble PSG. “It was a special operation,” he said. “In medical terms the operation succeeded but the patient died, so not that good in the end. But we worked on a gameplan that was a little bit different and very close to succeeding.”
There were signs of a greater flexibility than Spurs had tended to exhibit under Frank’s predecessor, Ange Postecoglou. “We showed that we can be adaptable and pragmatic, and we needed to be against a team like PSG,” he said. “The way we wanted to defend, high pressure and low defending, was top, almost perfect, and also the set pieces were very good and dangerous.”
A Premier League opener with Burnley awaits on Saturday and, in the meantime, Spurs are attempting to sign the Manchester City forward Savinho and the Crystal Palace ­talisman Eberechi Eze. “We’d like to strengthen the squad, no doubt about that,” Frank said. “We do work very hard to see if we can do that. In general I am very happy with the squad but in any transfer window we try to see if we can make the squad stronger before the window closes.”
The PSG manager Luis Enrique praised Lucas Chevalier, the debutant goalkeeper, who replaced the seemingly outbound Gianluigi ­Donnarumma. Chevalier should have done better for Romero’s goal but saved from Van de Ven in the shootout.
“He’s shown personality and we want him to integrate with the team immediately,” he said. “Everyone was talking about the situation, his wasn’t easy, but he showed great character.”

In which case, relax. This is actually a column about sport: what it is, what it isn’t, how we watch it, where it’s going. Most important, you can rest assured I shall not be relating any details of my Fantasy Premier League exploits, for the same reason I will not be sharing my dreams, my Wordle stats or the contents of my belly button. However fascinating you may find your own, it is genuinely no excuse for wasting anybody else’s time.
At which point, we may just have lost the other half of the audience. Because there does seem to be a weird cultural divide over this stuff: a kind of snobbery/infantilism binary. So you get the increasingly prevalent view that obsessing over made-up teams in a made-up game is basically trite nonsense, the stuff of civilisational downfall, a parasite on the body of football. Often these accusations will be levelled by the very same people who argue that shouting at horses to run faster somehow constitutes the highest form of sporting endeavour.
And then at the other end of the scale you have the argot and arcana of the self-styled “FPL community”: a weird, idiosyncratic and above all deeply obsessive place, a rabbit hole of game theory and sprawling colour-coded spreadsheets, where grown men are brought to the brink of insanity by late fixture rearrangements, where Eddie Howe press conference footage is parsed in microscopic detail. Did he say Anthony Gordon “is being assessed” or “has been assessed”? Please. My family is dying.
People earn their living from fantasy football these days. People write PhDs on it. There are interminable FPL podcasts, FPL YouTube channels, bespoke analysis tools, live events. Younger fans, who we constantly hear have little appetite for 90-minute games, will spend many multiples of that watching a bloke on a webcam in his mum’s kitchen weighing up the merits of Murillo v Ola Aina, or whether Cody Gakpo constitutes a rotation risk.
Even traditional media have begun to take the hint. FPL content has infiltrated the Sky Sports News ticker, the BBC Sport website, the Google search algorithm, player interviews, radio commentary. Celebrities play it. Footballers play it. Ange Postecoglou dolefully admitted on arriving at Tottenham that he’d been forced to leave his friends’ fantasy league for the first time in 20 years. Gradually, insidiously, fantasy football has seeped into the way we cover and consume football: a shadow game that has become almost inimical to the real thing. In a way this is a development that has taken place in parallel with the Premier League itself. Frank Skinner’s and David Baddiel’s Fantasy Football League was first broadcast in 1993, the Daily Telegraph introduced its seminal play-by-mail game in 1994, and in hindsight these were the first evolutionary twirls of what we now have to describe as the EPL global cinematic universe. Games, jokes, daydreams and deep dives, idle chatter and hot takes: an empire of content centred on the weekend fixture list but slowly rumbling into every corner of our lives.
For the Premier League itself, the game and its 11 million players constitute not so much a revenue stream – the game is free to play and always has been – as a kind of awesome soft power. In an age when viewers are increasingly selective about the football they watch, fantasy football gives every minute of every game a certain relevance. Whether Bournemouth claim a late consolation while losing 3-0 at Manchester City has almost zero relevance in the real world. But if you’re counting on a Josko Gvardiol clean sheet, you may just carry on watching to the very end.
And so fantasy sport occupies a kind of strange middle status: utterly contingent on the action while somehow entirely detached from it. In this regard it is not a million miles from the fan fiction and user-generated narratives that populate so many youth-oriented subcultures, a way of putting your own stamp on the game, a vehicle for expression and cognition, a way of being an active participant rather than a passive consumer.
Naturally the whiff of condescension will always follow fantasy football, in the same way video games have always been regarded as a lower and more banal form of cultural output. But frankly, is it any less valid a way of consuming Premier League football than the other forms of obsession associated with it? Is it any more trivial or frivolous than living vicariously through transfer gossip, or writing long boring threads about football accountancy, or taking an interest in who Morgan Gibbs-White’s partner has decided to unfollow on Instagram, or where referees come from?
Like all forms of mass culture, football generates hinterlands in abundance. Perhaps in a certain light it is possible to see fantasy football as the least toxic of them: not as aggressive as social media discourse, not as socially harmful as gambling, not as demented as conspiracy theory. For its most devoted practitioners it offers a form of community and agency, a weekly microdose of triumph and disaster, an emotional stake in a game that so often regards its fans as raw consumers.
At least, for now. As with anything wildly popular, the explosion of FPL has been accompanied by the usual agents of greed and grift, exploitation and opportunism. Money leagues, while theoretically banned, continue to flourish. The market in artificial intelligence tools and insider knowledge, paywalled by premium subscriptions, has gone through the roof. In recent years professional poker players have increasingly begun to migrate to FPL.
Meanwhile the passageway from fantasy sport to problem gambling is smoothed by the numerous betting companies targeting FPL content for advertising and partnerships.
And perhaps none of this has ever moved you in the slightest, never has, never will. But on some level FPL does articulate what has always been one of the great unexplored tensions in football. To what extent do the ephemera and subcultures of a sport enrich the true essence of the game, and to what extent do they dilute it? What happens when the sideshow dissolves into the main show? Established as a harmless bit of fun, built through community, grown through popular demand, and now under assault by big money and big tech: on reflection, perhaps fantasy football is a pretty good model for the game itself.

"‘I don’t want to be Gary’: Kelly Cates on Sky, Match of the Day and social media","Presenter on mixing Sky and BBC duties, the benefits of a conversational style and replacing a legend",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/match-of-the-day-kelly-cates-gary-lineker-bbc,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:00:21",Paul MacInnes,['Liverpool'],"Kelly Cates is about to begin the busiest year of her career. That, to be fair, is an estimate, because the football presenter and broadcaster has always been a grafter. From Setanta Sports to Channel 5 there are few places where she has not applied her blend of deep knowledge and emotional warmth, and as of this weekend she will be the face of the BBC’s and Sky’s coverage of the Premier League.
The action gets under way at a second home, Anfield, from where Cates will host Sky’s Friday Night Football coverage of Liverpool v Bournemouth. This follows two preview shows for the BBC, and precedes her first shift on Match of the Day.
Asked whether her schedule might be daunting, Cates appears almost bemused. “I’ve just got busy weekends, but I work in sports so I expect to have busy weekends,” she says. “It’s not as complicated as you think – there’s a very fast train to Manchester.”
Cates, speaking at Sky’s HQ, says she doesn’t want to sound cliched but “it’s good to keep doing new things”. Her new roles are a chance to “keep things fresh”. Having worked in the industry for 27 years, starting with a presenting role on the opening morning of Sky Sports News, “to get a chance to do something new and still have the live football and have so many live games, it’s just really lovely to have that balance”.
For many years Cates had to endure questions that her colleagues don’t; from being a woman in a man’s world to being the daughter of a football legend, Sir Kenny Dalglish. She has long since carved out her own place in sports broadcasting, however, so when she was approached for the role of Match of the Day host, alongside Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan, Sky immediately brokered a deal that would keep her on its roster too.
While her male colleagues may get more attention, usually adjacent to some controversy, Cates’s less combative approach has helped to shape contemporary coverage of football on TV (and radio). Her more approachable and conversational style is suited to the age of podcasting and long‑form interviews.
“I think that the tone generally has changed to become more conversational on air, and I think that’s probably because that’s come from digital,” she says. “A lot of that was fan-led and a lot of it was just people starting up on their own at the beginning. But I think you can have a conversational tone without having a conversation, and you can still interview somebody while having a conversational tone.”
Cates offers another distinction from many of her peers; she is not an avid user of social media. She has no account on X and tends to use Instagram to promote her work rather than share her worldview. “I haven’t ever really used my social media for that, so it isn’t something that I’m going to have to change,” she says.
“I think that in a lot of cases, I’m not the best-placed person to talk about some of those issues. And I think there’s a tendency to believe that if somebody isn’t talking about something they don’t care about it. I think it’s perfectly possible to care about something and keep quiet and let experts talk about it, which I think is a lot of the time better. I always feel like if I couldn’t cope well with being challenged heavily on it, then I shouldn’t be putting my opinion out publicly.”
That she should be asked about her posting reflects the Gary Lineker-shaped presence in the room. Cates, Chapman and Logan are being asked by the BBC to team up to replace a broadcasting legend, with all the public scrutiny that entails. Cates says she has not spoken to Lineker about the job, but defends his reputation despite his being a “controversial” figure.
“He hasn’t got in touch and I haven’t got in touch with him, but not because we’re avoiding each other. We just don’t know each other that well. I think [Chapman] was saying that Gary said: ‘Why would I tell three broadcasters how to do their job?’ Which is very lovely of him because he was brilliant at the job. And as much as he was a controversial character at times, any focus group that researched these things would tell you how much he was adored in that role.”
On how she will approach following in the footsteps of yet another football legend, Cates is matter of fact.
“I don’t want to be Gary. I think there’s a temptation to try and be someone else, and I think that you get a job because of yourself. If then you try to be someone else, it can all just get a bit confused. I don’t need another thing to think about. I don’t need to be sitting there thinking: ‘What would Gary do?’”
Cates has enough talent and experience to help her adapt to her new prominence. Britons will see a lot more of her on their screens and she will be watching even more football. Is there any possibility that more could become too much? “If it was going to happen, it would have kicked in by now,” she says with a smile.

Manchester United show patience and hope for big things from Benjamin Sesko | Andy Brassell,"After the club’s two previous attempts to sign the forward, Ruben Amorim will be hoping they have found the real deal",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/manchester-united-benjamin-sesko,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 19:00:02",Andy Brassell,['Manchester United'],"It has, for a while, appeared to be destiny. Benjamin Sesko’s arrival at Manchester United was third time lucky for last season’s Europa League finalists, having attempted to make a deal for the Slovenia striker when he was leaving Domžale in 2019 and again when he agreed to fly the Red Bull Salzburg nest in 2022, eventually joining up with RB Leipzig a year down the line.
Now United have their still-only-22-year-old man and if Sesko has been feted in the inner circles of European football since his mid-teens, one could suggest the wait has not only be worthwhile but that it could work in favour of Ruben Amorim as he attempts to author a dramatic uptick in the fortunes of the English game’s premier fallen giant.
And now, the time for talking and for contemplating is done. United have wanted their headline No 9, and Sesko has wanted his chance to shine in England. Both have had their wishes come true and both need to prove that their partnership can be a fruitful one because, beyond the hype, club and player have a lot staked on this, and really need it to work. Sesko’s debut is expected to come at home to Arsenal on Sunday.
Ever since Sesko arrived at Leipzig in 2023, it was strongly suspected this moment would come. From even earlier, perhaps. Sesko arrived in the Red Bull universe in 2019, signing his Salzburg deal a few days after turning 16, less than a year after Erling Haaland had done the same.
Haaland is a figure who frequently comes up when discussing and describing Sesko; not just because of entrusting his development to Red Bull’s finishing school but because of their comparative athletic profiles. Both men are 6ft 5in, both have the build that would suggest they would be traditional target men and both have lightning pace that one doesn’t expect from a player of that stature.
Yet from there, they diverge. If the physical characteristics of Haaland and Sesko are slightly misleading, so is the suggestion that they are similar players. The Norwegian, from his first steps in the Salzburg first team, had looked like the goal machine he has proved to be so emphatically in Dortmund and Manchester. Sesko, his successor, never really looked like doing the same, even if he struck 16 times in 30 Austrian Bundesliga games in his final Salzburg season.
What Sesko lacked in sheer goal volume, though, he made up for in his all-round game, which outstripped that of Haaland when he was in Austria (or Germany for that matter). In terms of running the channels, linking with teammates in the final third and being an authentic part of the team rather than just a penalty box predator, Salzburg-era Sesko was clearly the brighter bet. It was entirely legitimate, however, to wonder how regularly he might score in Germany after making the move to Leipzig.
The big success of his time with Leipzig was his arrival as a consistent goalscorer in a top European league. A pair of six-week droughts, one in autumn, another in early spring, meant he ended up with a lower Bundesliga tally last term than in his debut season, 13 compared with 14, but his ability to be decisive and make proper use of his natural gifts – strength, speed, a thunderous shot, the ability to peel away from defenders with the adroitness of a smaller man and ability in the air when required – has been clear.
Sesko’s spell in the Bundesliga, like Haaland’s, always felt like a loan in all but name and contractual detail. More than a finishing school, it was more a waiting room until an inevitable move to the Premier League.
Mikel Arteta’s longstanding interest in Sesko was no secret but the arrival of Andrea Berta at Arsenal (with his record of going big on established centre-forwards) shifted the club’s focus to Viktor Gyökeres, which opened the door for United to try again for Šeško.
The past two young forwards with hoped-for big futures who were lured to Old Trafford – Rasmus Højlund and Joshua Zirkzee – have hardly been resounding successes, so there must be real scrutiny on whether United can be the right club for Sesko and whether the player has made a wise choice.
If some have questioned his decision to join a club without European football this season – which would have been the same had he stayed at Leipzig – it is really about the medium term. Højlund and Zirkzee are two among countless examples of talented players who have arrived at Old Trafford and not become the players they were expected to be.
One could argue that Newcastle were Sesko’s safer bet, given that his aim will be for his Premier League trajectory to mirror that of Alexander Isak, transforming strong potential into all-conquering product. Amorim has successfully developed players beyond their wildest dreams (Gyökeres being the most famous example) so perhaps he can do so again, with a pre-season behind him and a squad more shaped to his liking.
Sesko’s temperament gives him a great chance; throughout this summer’s transfer saga he behaved in an exemplary fashion at Leipzig, with the sporting director, Marcel Schäfer, underlining this week that “his move is a loss both from a sporting and a personal perspective”. His success in the Premier League would be a significant corner turned for this latest United rebuild.

Transfer roundup: Liverpool close on £26m Leoni deal to boost Slot’s defence,Calvert-Lewin undergoing medical at Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/dominic-calvert-lewin-leeds-transfer-latest,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 21:24:10",Andy Hunter,"['Manchester United', 'Liverpool']","Liverpool are close to signing Parma’s teenage centre-back Giovanni Leoni for an initial fee of £26m. The 18-year-old was a target for several Italian and Premier League clubs after impressing for Parma last season but Liverpool look to have beaten off the competition as they attempt to increase Arne Slot’s defensive options.
Manchester United were among the Premier League clubs to register interest in the defender. Inter had hoped to reunite Leoni with the former Parma coach Cristian Chivu but were unable to match the financial offer from Liverpool.
Liverpool consider Leoni one of the most promising young defenders in Europe and, having agreed a package with Parma, he is expected to go straight into the first-team squad. A deal for the 6ft 5in defender would not end the Premier League champions’ interest in Marc Guéhi. Negotiations with Crystal Palace over the England international are continuing.
Dominic Calvert-Lewin is undergoing a medical at Leeds with a view to sealing a free transfer to the promoted Premier League club. The 28‑year-old centre-forward has been a free agent since leaving Everton in June after nine years. He scored 71 times in 273 appearances for the club and described his departure as “incredibly difficult”.
Moving to Elland Road, where he is poised to become the eighth recruit of a busy summer, would bring the former Sheffield United player back to his native Yorkshire. Calvert-Lewin would compete with the former Wolfsburg forward Lukas Nmecha and Joël Piroe, the Championship top scorer last season, for a place in Daniel Farke’s XI.
Calvert-Lewin’s arrival would be expected to accelerate Patrick Bamford’s exit from Leeds. Farke has told Bamford he has no future at the club. His fellow forward Mateo Joseph has joined Mallorca on loan. Calvert-Lewin, like Bamford, has struggled with injuries in recent seasons. He has 11 England caps, scoring four goals, but last played for his country in 2021.
Newcastle are among a clutch of clubs who had considered Calvert‑Lewin, scorer of three goals last season, but they decided he was too injury‑prone.
The Fulham striker Rodrigo Muniz had ranked high on Farke’s attacking shortlist but, providing Calvert‑Lewin’s medical proceeds as planned, Leeds seem unlikely to continue that pursuit.
Fulham are anxious to retain Muniz but he has recently been the subject of a near-£35m bid from Atalanta and is another option considered by Newcastle as Eddie Howe reshapes his frontline.
Bournemouth have signed Bafodé Diakité from Lille to replace Illia Zabarnyi, who joined PSG on Tuesday. The south coast club have paid an initial £30m for Diakité and will bank almost £40m profit on Zabarnyi, who was sold in a £57m deal.
Bournemouth, who are interested in the Bayer Leverkusen winger Amine Adli, still want another centre-back after the sales of Zabarnyi and Dean Huijsen. They are another club who have tracked Parma’s Leoni.

Gary Neville’s row with Nottingham Forest unresolved as new season beckons,Sky pundit was banned from final game of last season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/gary-neville-row-nottingham-forest-unresolved-sky-ban-assurances,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 11:46:24",Matt Hughes,['Manchester United'],"Nottingham Forest have not resolved their dispute with Gary Neville before the new Premier League season and want assurances from the Sky Sports pundit before welcoming him back to the City Ground.
The former Manchester United captain was banned by Forest from the final game of last season after an intervention from their owner, Evangelos Marinakis, who had taken exception to Neville’s criticisms of his conduct.
Although Neville is not formally banned, the Guardian has been told Sky should not expect Neville to be accommodated as things stand. Forest want to resolve the issue but will demand assurances Neville will be more careful in his language when discussing Marinakis before confirming he can attend.
Neville’s claim in April 2024 that the club were behaving like “a mafia gang” particularly angered Marinakis and led to the owner threatening legal action against Sky. In a statement three months later, the broadcaster said: “Sky Sports have discussed with Gary the language used and its potential to cause offence.” Sky also apologised “for any offence caused”.
Neville has not been to Forest since he made those comments. He had been due to be part of Sky’s team there on the final day of last season for the visit of Chelsea but the broadcaster was forced to change its plans at the last minute, after Neville was denied media accreditation. It used its studios to present coverage of a game that decided the European fate of both clubs.
Sky described Forest’s ban as “an unprecedented and unwelcome step”. Neville wrote on social media at the time: “I’ve dished out my fair share of criticism and praise in the last 14 years of doing this job and have never come close to this unprecedented action. Personally, I think it’s disappointing that a great club like Nottingham Forest have been reduced to making such a decision. Whilst they have every right to choose who they let into their own stadium, it’s symptomatic of things that have happened over the last 12 months with the club.”
Two weeks earlier Neville had criticised Marinakis for walking on to the pitch and remonstrating with Forest’s manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, after a 2-2 draw with Leicester. Marinakis said he was frustrated that the injured forward Taiwo Awoniyi had been allowed to play on after colliding with a post. The striker had abdominal surgery the next day.
Neville described Marinakis’s conduct as “scandalous” and said Nuno should “negotiate his exit” over the way he appeared to have been spoken to by the owner.
Neville said the club had acted like a “mafia gang” in issuing a statement that criticised the video assistant referee Stuart Attwell after a 2-0 defeat at Everton. Forest were fined £750,000 by the Football Association for “an attack on the integrity of a match official on an unparalleled scale” but, after threatening legal action, secured the apology from Sky.
Forest did not breach any regulations by denying access to Neville but the league was unimpressed at the treatment of its main domestic broadcast partner. Sky will broadcast live coverage of Forest’s opening game against Brentford at the City Ground on Sunday, but Neville will be at Old Trafford for Manchester United v Arsenal.
Sky is understood to have assumed Neville’s ban was a one-off and that the matter was closed, but further talks will be required to resolve the standoff.
Forest and Sky Sports declined to comment.

Marcus Rashford claims Manchester United are stuck in ‘no man’s land’,Forward says club paying for lack of clear direction,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/marcus-rashford-manchester-united-no-mans-land-plan,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 08:28:15",Andy Hunter,['Manchester United'],"Marcus Rashford has offered a withering assessment of Manchester United’s decline, claiming a lack of identity since Sir Alex Ferguson retired has marooned the club in “no man’s land”.
The on-loan Barcelona striker insists the club’s predicament hurts him as a United player and fan, and laid the blame firmly at Old Trafford’s door. Too many managerial changes and different strategies had undermined the playing principles established under Ferguson, said Rashford, and prevented any meaningful transition. He believes United will not be serious contenders for the Premier League again unless they keep faith with a clear plan.
United endured their worst top-flight campaign since being relegated in 1973-74 when finishing 15th last season. Ruben Amorim, who sidelined Rashford before his loans to Aston Villa and Barcelona, is United’s sixth permanent manager since Ferguson stepped down in 2013, the last time the club won the title. Rashford came through United’s academy while Ferguson was in charge.
“Show me a successful team that just adapts,” Rashford told the Rest is Football podcast with Gary Lineker and Micah Richards. “When Fergie was in charge, not only the principles for the first team, the whole academy set-up so you could pick players from 15 years and over – that’s a full generation. And they’d all understand the principles of playing the Man United way, right?
“You see it with any team that’s been successful over a period of time: they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles. Whereas at times I feel like United have just been … we’re hungry to win, so we’ll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it’s reactionary.
“If your direction’s always changing, you can’t expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it’s because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team – you’re not there by accident. This is what some people forget.
“So yeah, we’ve been way below where we deem United to be. But then if you take a step back, which I’ve been able to do, especially over the last six months – what do you expect? People say we’ve been in a transition for years. To be in a transition, you have to start the transition. So it’s like the actual transition’s not started yet.”
No United manager in the post-Ferguson era has been given three years. Rashford said the club could learn from their fierce rivals Liverpool, who ended a 30-year wait for a top-flight title under Jürgen Klopp in 2020. Klopp joined in October 2015 and secured his first trophy in 2019.
“When Liverpool went through this, they got Klopp, they stuck with him,” Rashford said. “They didn’t win in the beginning. People only remember his final few years when he was competing with [Manchester] City and winning the biggest trophies – he certainly didn’t win for three years.
“To start a transition, you have to make a plan and stick to it. So this is the thing that I feel – it’s not easy. But this is where I speak about being realistic with what your situation is. I feel like we’ve had that many different managers and different ideas and different strategies in order to win … you end up in the middle of – you end up in no man’s land.”

Football transfer rumours: Gianluigi Donnarumma to Manchester City?,Today’s rumours are celebrating a new Sorry album,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/football-transfer-rumours-gianluigi-donnarumma-to-manchester-city,"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 08:31:14",Rob Smyth,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester City']","If you had suggested, as Gianluigi Donnarumma’s Brobdingnagian hands were extinguishing Arsenal’s Champions League hopes in May, that Paris Saint-Germain would bundle him out the door marked Do One a few months later, you’d have been laughed out of the football WhatsApp group faster than you could say “Toxic Hipsters”.
Who’s laughing now? You are! Or at least you would be had the above scenario been a representation of reality rather than the Rumour Mill’s exhausted imagination. Luis Enrique wants a different profile of goalkeeper – imagine if someone had used that phrase within earshot of Brian Clough or Bill Shankly – and Donnarumma may well be using his giant frame and even bigger aura in the Premier League this season.
Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United are among the sides unable to believe their potential luck. If Pep Guardiola draws the 6ft 4in straw, Ederson will be offloaded to Galatasaray faster than you can say “we need a different profile of goalkeeper, Brian”.
Real Madrid are considering cutting out the middle man, known in some cultures as Liverpool Football Club, by buying Adam Wharton direct from Crystal Palace. Any move is unlikely to happen this summer.
Liverpool have eyes on a different Eagle, the Palace captain, Marc Guéhi. Parma’s teenage centre-back Giovanni Leoni also gives good data and is a potential back-up.
Palace immortal Eberechi Eze is still being courted by Spurs and Arsenal, with Thomas Frank’s manic charisma putting Spurs in pole position.
Newcastle’s windus horribilis will improve a bit if they secure the signing of Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa, who in turn would like to re-sign Marco Asensio on loan from PSG.
Bayer Leverkusen have their peepers trained on Brighton’s Facundo Buonanotte, while their forward Amine Adli could be on his way to Bournemouth.
Christopher Nkunku wants to leave Chelsea for Bayern Munich, while Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho has reportedly (OK, OK, someone said so on Twitter.com) told his nearest and dearest that Chelsea are the only club he wants to join.
Manchester United, meanwhile, are dreaming of Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano. Aren’t we all?
