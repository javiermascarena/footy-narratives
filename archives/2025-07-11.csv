Arsenal close to agreeing £50m deal for Chelsea's Madueke,Arsenal are close to finalising a &#163;50m deal to sign Chelsea forward Noni Madueke.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13395213/noni-madueke-transfer-news-arsenal-close-to-agreeing-50m-deal-for-chelsea-winger,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 21:00:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Arsenal are close to finalising a £50m deal to sign Chelsea forward Noni Madueke.
It was thought that discussions between the clubs would start following the FIFA Club World Cup.
However, talks have progressed, with Madueke understood to be open to the move across the capital.
Personal terms on a five-year contract have been agreed in principle.
Arsenal have been looking to sign a left-sided forward this summer, although Madueke featured 33 times on the right side of Chelsea's attack during the 2024/25 season and on only seven occasions on the left, contributing no goals or assists in that time.
The Gunners, who have also looked at a number of other players in the forward positions, including Real Madrid's Rodrygo, have both Bukayo Saka and Ethan Nwaneri to fill the right-winger spot.
Chelsea signed Madueke from PSV Eindhoven for £29m in January 2023, and he has five years left on his contract. However, the Blues have strengthened significantly in attacking areas this summer.
Strikers Liam Delap arrived for £30m from Ipswich Town and Joao Pedro joined from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m.
The west London club also added Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for an initial fee of £48.5m, plus £3.5m in potential add ons.
Real Madrid forward Rodrygo is the other top target Arsenal have for that position. It appears unlikely they are going to sign both players, but it is unclear at this stage which deal the club are prioritising.
Rodrygo would certainly be the more exciting signing given his profile and pedigree, being a two-time Champions League winner.
Reports in Spain indicate he is valued at around £69m (€80m) which is likely to be a lot more than Chelsea demand for Madueke.
Rodrygo's future at Real is up in the air under new boss Xabi Alonso, who has given him a limited role at the Club World Cup. The Brazil forward has not started a match since their opener against Al Hilal.
The 24-year-old has become known for being a right-winger at Madrid, but his preferred position is on the left, which would suit Arsenal's needs.
Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:
Arsenal's pursuit of Noni Madueke has been a surprise - and a significant transfer fee put towards the Chelsea winger would split opinion in the Gunners fanbase.
Arsenal are looking for a new winger to refresh their wide options but many expected the No 1 target to be Real Madrid's Rodrygo or Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams.
Both have the status and talent to match what Bukayo Saka does on the opposite flank.
As a right-winger, Madueke would provide the Gunners with suitable cover for Saka - but is he the answer for Arsenal as a first-choice left winger?
The 23-year-old played most of last season on the right but it is worth noting that eight out of his last nine appearances for club and country have come on the left wing.
In his seven starts for Chelsea on the left last term, Madueke failed to get a goal, an assist or create a big chance in any of them. Looking at the numbers and his overall play, he seems more comfortable on the right.
However, it is worth noting that Chelsea did win six of those seven games where Madueke started on the left - the only defeat was the 2-0 loss at Newcastle, where Nicolas Jackson was sent off and Madueke was sacrificed at half-time.
Madueke did get an assist for England's winner against Andorra after starting on the left wing. But is Madueke going to significantly improve Arsenal's options in that position, even though he may be cheaper than Rodrygo?
Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:
""We've been telling you for the past couple of weeks that there were question marks about Madueke's future at Chelsea and we've also been telling you that Arsenal are very, very interested in signing him. Arsenal have now made their move to sign him.
""I think it's a bit of a complicated situation regarding Madueke because he's played well for Chelsea since they signed him two and a half years ago from PSV Eindhoven for £29m. But it's been well documented that Chelsea have spent a lot of money in the transfer window already this summer and they need to balance their books.
""Last week they came to an agreement with UEFA that basically said that if they want to register new players for the Champions League next season, they have to make sure that their transfer spend this season is balanced out this summer by the players they sell as well. So they've signed players like Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. That means they also have to sell players.
""When clubs like Arsenal ring them up asking about Noni Madueke, I think Chelsea's position has to be that players are not officially for sale, but obviously if you want to put in an offer, put in an offer and we will judge it on its merits.
""I get the feeling that Noni Madueke is going to be an Arsenal player this summer. The timing probably is not great for Chelsea because they're on a high after winning their semi-final at the Club World Cup. They're preparing for the final on Sunday against PSG or Real Madrid.
""To be fair to Noni Madueke, and this is a point that Enzo Maresca has made out here in the US, he's got his head straight even though there's all this speculation swirling around about his future and the fact that he may well be an Arsenal player. He still performed for Chelsea when he's been called upon.
""He came on as a second-half substitute on Tuesday against Fluminense. He came on as a second-half substitute in the quarter-final against Palmeiras and played very, very well. So to be fair to him, he's not letting all these reports affect him, but I get the feeling that his days at Chelsea are numbered because they need to balance their books.""

Spurs trigger Gibbs-White's release clause,Tottenham have triggered a &#163;60m release clause in Morgan Gibbs-White's Nottingham Forest contract.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13395095/morgan-gibbs-white-transfer-news-tottenham-hotspur-trigger-60m-release-clause-for-nottingham-forest-midfielder,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 16:25:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have triggered a £60m release clause in Morgan Gibbs-White's Nottingham Forest contract.
The 25-year-old is now expected to undergo a medical in the coming days.
The England international scored seven goals and registered 11 assists as Forest qualified for Europe last season.
Earlier this year, Sky Sports News reported Gibbs-White was on Manchester City's shortlist of attacking options. Pep Guardiola's side have already moved for AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki as new attacking midfield options.
News of Spurs' pursuit of Gibbs-White comes a day after last season's Europa League winners agreed a £55m deal with West Ham for Mohammed Kudus.
Kudus is undergoing his medical with Spurs on Thursday ahead of signing a six-year contract.
The two transfers - the first of the Thomas Frank era - are set to cost Spurs a combined £115m.
It represents another loss for Forest, who are also set to lose Anthony Elanga to Newcastle after a deal worth up to £55m was agreed this week.
Latest from Sky Sports News' Michael Bridge:
""This is a huge boost for Thomas Frank, who is a huge fan of Morgan Gibbs-White, when he was Brentford manager, and it looks like Spurs could be spending over £100m over the next couple of days as we await the confirmation of Mohamed Kudus.
""Frank has said in the past, at football clubs, it's got to be the right environment. He can have no complaints about what he has had so far in terms of signings. Kudus is very exciting, and Gibbs-White has been an absolute pleasure to watch for Nottingham Forest.""
Cristian Romero is the subject of long-term interest from Atletico Madrid but the Tottenham vice-captain, also the player of the match in the Europa League final win over Manchester United, is considered a very important member of Thomas Frank's side
Sky Sports News understands that it would take a huge bid for the club to even consider selling a key player.

Spurs complete £55m deal for West Ham's Kudus,Tottenham have completed the signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for &#163;55m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13394694/mohammed-kudus-transfer-news-tottenham-complete-55m-deal-to-sign-west-ham-forward,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 21:30:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have completed the signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for £55m.
Kudus - who also attracted interest from Chelsea and Newcastle - has joined Spurs on a six-year deal.
The Ghana international scored 13 goals and set up 12 in 65 Premier League games for West Ham, after arriving from Ajax in 2023.
This is the first transfer between Tottenham and West Ham since Scott Parker's move to Spurs in 2011. Spurs were looking to sign a forward who can play across the front line and Kudus fits that bill.
Spurs also remain interested in Brentford's Yoane Wissa.
Sky Sports News' Michael Bridge:
""Kudus was identified as a priority signing for Thomas Frank.
""It's usually unthinkable a transfer between the two clubs but the Ghanian international only wanted to sign for Spurs.
""A fee of around £54.5m also means Spurs avoid 'the Tottenham tax' that was widely reported given West Ham's reluctance to do business with the north London side in the past.
""West Ham will reinvest a chunk of the Kudus money for Graham Potter to bring in his own players but there will be huge pressure to get it right given most of the West Ham supporters feelings on the Kudus deal to Spurs on X this week: ""Anyone but them.""
Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth:
""Tottenham are after one of Thomas Frank's former players, Yoane Wissa. That pursuit, I'm told, will not be impacted by Kudus' imminent arrival.
""There's been no club-to-club contact between Tottenham and Brentford as of yet, but we expect that to be pretty soon.
""Wissa is into the final year of his contract and turns 29 in September, with those ingredients, Tottenham may feel that there is a deal to be done.""
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
Kudus is an exciting signing. Spurs rarely do business with West Ham - the Ghanaian is the first purchase from their rivals in 14 years - but Kudus was deemed talented enough to be the exception.
Kudus is just about to turn 25, adds much-needed depth to Spurs' wide attacking positions and, after two seasons in east London, is well aware of the demands of the Premier League.
But how much of a concern should his second season for West Ham be?
Kudus was named as the division's best newcomer by Sky Sports' Gary Neville in the Monday Night Football awards at the end of the 2023/24 season. A £38m purchase from Ajax looked like a bargain for West Ham, with Kudus scoring 14 times across all competitions, setting up nine more goals and bringing excitement to the London Stadium with his lightning, direct dribbles.
But there were just five goals in all last term. As well as one at Spurs, his only other goals came home and away against Brighton and Ipswich, with his final strike of the season arriving with just three minutes to play against relegated opposition at Portman Road.
Statistically it was a disappointing dip from the promise of that first campaign. There were, though, caveats around West Ham's form and also the positions Kudus was asked to play during the 2024/25 season, plugging gaps across the frontline as injuries struck.
Will a Tottenham team that finished three places below the Hammers but scored 18 more goals provide the environment to help Kudus fire like he did in that first year in England?
The approach of new Spurs boss Thomas Frank will be significant. Bryan Mbeumo, a left-footer like Kudus, starred on the right side of Frank's attack at Brentford, scoring 20 times last season. Could Frank help Kudus get near those levels?
Spurs believe the answer is yes to both of those questions and now Kudus has a fresh platform to reignite the buzz which came with his first campaign in England.

Arsenal complete Norgaard signing,Arsenal have completed the signing of midfielder Christian Norgaard from Brentford in a deal worth up to &#163;15m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13389106/arsenal-sign-christian-norgaard-from-brentford-in-15m-transfer-deal,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 12:00:00",,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have completed the signing of midfielder Christian Norgaard from Brentford in a deal worth up to £15m.
Norgaard has signed a two-year deal with the option of the third and is the club's third signing of the summer.
Sky Sports News reported last month that they agreed a £15m deal with Brentford to sign the defensive midfielder. That deal is broken up into a guaranteed £10m plus £5m in add-ons.
The prospect of playing in the Champions League was a big factor in Norgaard making the switch across London to Arsenal.
He said: ""You can get almost emotional because maybe it was a dream that I've given a little bit up on coming towards the later stage in my career.
""I've just turned 31 and had signed a new deal with Brentford. Of course, there's always a little chance that a miracle could happen with Brentford, but it was probably unrealistic to play Champions League with them.
""Now, I get to hear the anthem and be a part of a Champions League campaign. It's a childhood dream and something I didn't think would be possible. So it's something I'm really, really happy about.""
Brentford captain Norgaard follows the arrivals of Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and Real Sociedad midfielder Martin Zubimendi.
The Gunners have also made Chelsea winger Noni Madueke a top target, while they are advancing on a move for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres.
Arsenal are also interested in Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Crystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze in what is turning out to be a pivotal summer for Mikel Arteta.
On Norgaard's arrival, Arteta said: ""We're delighted to welcome Christian to Arsenal. He is an international player with a wealth of experience of the Premier League. He has proven leadership skills and a strong character which will be invaluable to our squad.
""He is a strong midfielder with excellent tactical awareness and versatility. He also has physical presence and intelligence which will give us added depth and balance.""
Analysis from Sky Sports' Nick Wright:
Norgaard is an atypical Arsenal signing in terms of age. At 31, he offers little resale value. He does, though, help mitigate the loss of Jorginho's experience. He heads to the Emirates Stadium having racked up 122 Premier League appearances for Brentford.
His age means he also comes for a relatively low fee, reducing the financial risk of the deal and allowing Arsenal to hold back funds for the attacking recruits still needed.
Some supporters would have liked Arsenal to go for a younger, more exciting option with a higher ceiling. The club reportedly considered Sevilla's 23-year-old midfielder Lucien Agoume as an alternative.
But Albert Sambi Lokonga, Agoume's team-mate while on loan at Sevilla last season, offers a cautionary tale having failed to make the grade at Arsenal. The club now stand little chance of recouping the £15m spent to sign him from Anderlecht in 2021.
Together with Fabio Vieira, a £34m signing from Porto sent back to his old club on loan last season, and Nuno Tavares, an £8m signing from Benfica who also struggled, Lokonga helps to explain why Arsenal now favour Premier League-ready additions such as Norgaard.
Read more analysis from Nick's feature here...
Norgaard's move to Arsenal has brought an end to his six-year spell at Brentford.
He joined the west London club from Fiorentina in May 2019 and became a key player for the Bees in their promotion to the Premier League.
Norgaard was hugely influential under Thomas Frank, who left in June to become Tottenham head coach after seven impressive years at Brentford.
Brentford could see star player Bryan Mbeumo follow their manager and captain out of the door.
Manchester United remain optimistic of agreeing a deal to sign Mbeumo in time for the forward to be part of their pre-season tour of the United States.
There remains a gap in valuation, but United are not far away from the overall fee Brentford want - believed to be £65m - however there is still work to do on the structure as the west London club want the majority, if not all, of the fee to be paid up front.
A summer of change at the Gtech Community Stadium has seen Keith Andrews appointed as the club's new head coach.
Brentford spoke to a number of high-profile managers from across Europe but opted for someone who knows the club and their systems, and they believe Andrews can become a top head coach, having joined as an assistant to Frank last year.

Why Norgaard? What next for Rice? Arsenal's midfield rebuild explained,Arsenal are yet to complete the striker signing fans crave but progress is being made on other areas of the squad as Christian Norgaard becomes their third recruit of the summer.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13388836/arsenal-transfer-news-christian-norgaard-to-the-gunners-brentford-captain-can-bring-experience-and-set-piece-threat-in-midfield-overhaul,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 12:01:00",Nick Wright,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal are yet to complete the striker signing fans crave but progress is being made on other areas of the squad as Christian Norgaard becomes their third recruit of the summer.
The former Brentford captain arrives for an initial £10m, signing a two-year deal with an option for a further year, and joins fellow new arrivals Martin Zubimendi and Kepa Arrizabalaga at the club.
The 31-year-old's signing has split opinion but what makes Norgaard appealing? Does it make sense to target a Premier League-ready player in his position? And what's next on the to-do list?
News of Arsenal's move for Norgaard came as Thomas Partey was exiting the club. The 32-year-old, who has subsequently been charged by police with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault, was released at the end of his contract on June 30.
Partey's departure clearly prompted Arsenal to accelerate their plans to sign another midfielder but Norgaard should be viewed as a replacement for Jorginho, who departed on a free transfer to Flamengo in early June, rather than Partey.
The two players held very different roles in Arteta's squad.
Partey was his first-choice in the No 6 position, starting 31 Premier League games last season and playing 3,927 minutes in all competitions. Jorginho was his back-up, starting only nine Premier League games and playing just 1,452 minutes in total.
Norgaard was of course a key player for Brentford, playing an almost identical number of Premier League minutes to Partey last term. But with Zubimendi, a £51m signing from Real Sociedad, earmarked to replace Partey, the Denmark international will play a supporting role at Arsenal.
Norgaard is an atypical Arsenal signing in terms of age. At 31, he offers little resale value. He does, though, help mitigate the loss of Jorginho's experience. He heads to the Emirates Stadium having racked up 122 Premier League appearances for Brentford.
His age means he also comes for a relatively low fee, at an initial £10m, reducing the financial risk of the deal and allowing Arsenal to hold back funds for the attacking recruits still needed.
Some supporters would have liked Arsenal to go for a younger, more exciting option with a higher ceiling. The club reportedly considered Sevilla's 23-year-old midfielder Lucien Agoume as an alternative.
But Albert Sambi Lokonga, Agoume's team-mate while on loan at Sevilla last season, offers a cautionary tale having struggled to adjust to the demands of the No 6 role in the Premier League as a young player. Arsenal now stand little chance of recouping the £15m spent to sign him from Anderlecht in 2021.
Together with Fabio Vieira, a £34m signing from Porto sent back to his old club on loan last season, and Nuno Tavares, an £8m signing from Benfica who also struggled, Lokonga's plight helps to explain why Arsenal now favour experienced, Premier League-ready additions such as Norgaard.
The importance of reliability and durability cannot be underestimated. Norgaard has started nearly 80 per cent of Brentford's Premier League fixtures across the last four seasons.
He has a reputation as an exemplary professional and his work ethic shines through in tracking data which puts him among the Premier League's top 20 players for distance covered last season. At 31, he clearly has a lot left to offer physically, even in a demanding position.
Arteta regards commitment and combativeness as non-negotiables and Norgaard, a tigerish presence at the base of midfield who excels out of possession, brings both qualities, as well as leadership.
According to Opta, he ranked eighth in the Premier League for interceptions last season, with 49. He ranked second for possessions won in the middle third of the pitch, with 112 putting him behind only Chelsea midfielder Moises Caicedo.
Norgaard's ball-winning ability is one of his biggest strengths. Another is the threat he offers from set-pieces, something which no doubt forms a major part of his appeal to Arteta, who puts a significant emphasis on dead-ball situations with Nicolas Jover.
Norgaard is an imposing aerial presence at 6ft 1in. He has sharp instincts inside the box and excels at timing his runs to meet corners, free-kicks and even flick-ons from long throws.
Arsenal and Arteta have experienced it first hand. Norgaard scored from a Mads Bidstrup long throw in Brentford's very first Premier League game against the Gunners in 2021. He smashed home a loose ball following a free-kick in the reverse fixture that season.
He has caused problems for opponents consistently. Since Brentford's promotion, Opta data shows Norgaard has generated set-piece shots worth a whopping 10.26 expected goals.
It is the third-highest total in the Premier League in that timeframe, behind only Arsenal's Gabriel and Newcastle's Fabian Schar, and just ahead of Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk.
Norgaard is of course replacing a player with outstanding ball-playing ability in Jorginho. He will need to contribute to Arsenal's passing game, not just defensively and on set-pieces.
Arsenal averaged 57.1 per cent possession last season compared to Brentford's 47.7 per cent, so he will need to get used to seeing a lot more of the ball in his new surroundings.
It remains to be seen how he will adapt to that switch of emphasis but his former boss Thomas Frank described Norgaard as the player who ""made Brentford tick"". His technical quality might not be at the level of Jorginho's but it is an underrated aspect of his game.
Norgaard is a proficient passer over short and long distances. It is also worth noting that, like his new team-mate Zubimendi, he is forward-thinking with his distribution.
Last season, he directed 35.29 per cent of his passes forward in the Premier League, a significantly higher ratio than either Jorginho, Partey or Declan Rice. Arsenal are making a concerted effort to add more penetrative passers at the base of midfield.
Norgaard also ranked among the Premier League's top 10 players for passes completed between the lines last season. His ability to progress the ball up the pitch could help Arsenal remedy their issues with breaking down compact defences.
Some Arsenal fans might feel the club should be pursuing an offensive midfielder rather than a holding midfielder, given they already have Rice as well as the newly-arrived Zubimendi.
But the move for Norgaard is effectively confirmation that Rice is now seen by Arteta as a No 8. Although initially used as a No 6 following his arrival from West Ham two years ago, he has adapted impressively to a more advanced role on the left-hand side of Arsenal's midfield.
Last season, he played roughly 85 per cent of his minutes at No 8, producing a career-high total of nine goals in 52 games and also contributing 10 assists. The numbers help to explain why his future lies further forward than many anticipated when he joined.
Arsenal frustrated their fans with a perceived slow start to the transfer window. Confirmation of new contracts for Gabriel and Myles Lewis-Skelly were welcomed but rivals Liverpool and Manchester City were quicker to announce new arrivals.
Clearly, though, work has been done behind the scenes. The signing of Zubimendi was a year-long operation. With Norgaard expected to follow him and Kepa, Arsenal have effectively done half their business in time for the start of pre-season.
At the same time as negotiating a deal for Norgaard with Brentford, Arsenal have been in talks with Valencia over the signing of 20-year-old centre-back Cristhian Mosquera.
Of course, the most pressing requirements are at the other end of the pitch but things appear to be progressing on that front too.
Arsenal remain in talks to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting as their new striker. They are also negotiating a move for Chelsea winger Noni Madueke and remain interested in Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze.
With the start of the Premier League season still over a month away, and with progress to strengthen the squad accelerating, Arsenal might be in a better position than many think.
Sky Sports will broadcast a record minimum of 215 Premier League matches a season from 2025/26 after finalising a new four-year agreement for TV rights.
From the 2025/26 season, Sky Sports' exclusively live coverage will increase from 128 Premier League matches to at least 215 games.

Why Spurs made Kudus their first signing from West Ham in 14 years,BBC Sport looks at why new boss Thomas Frank wanted to add him to his squad – and why the transfer is a rare move for the north London outfit.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czxwg9qvv7no,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 21:50:41",Matthew Howarth,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"After a frustrating final season at West Ham, new Tottenham signing Mohammed Kudus is looking to rediscover the glittering form that made him one of European football's hottest properties just two summers ago.
The Ghanaian completed his £55m move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on a long-term contract on Thursday.
BBC Sport looks at why new boss Thomas Frank wanted to add him to his squad – and why the transfer is a rare move for the north London outfit.
From 'best newcomer' to Potter struggles
Kudus was the subject of huge interest from Premier League clubs in summer 2023 after a string of eye-catching displays in Ajax's 2022-23 Champions League campaign.
The Dutch giants were eliminated at the group stage but Kudus set up six goals in as many appearances - including a stunning effort off the underside of the bar in a 2-1 defeat against Liverpool at Anfield - catching the eye of Chelsea, Arsenal and Brighton, among others.
It was West Ham, though, who won the race to sign the Ghanaian, who wasted little time in recapturing the form of his final year in the Netherlands, plundering eight goals and six assists in the league in an excellent debut season under David Moyes.
Named the Premier League's best newcomer by Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville at the end of the campaign, Kudus also won West Ham's goal of the season award for his magnificent solo effort against German club Freiburg in the Europa League.
His second season with the Hammers, however, was underwhelming to say the least.
Kudus struggled to adapt to Graham Potter's wing-back system after the Englishman succeeded Julen Lopetegui in January 2024, his final-day effort against already-relegated Ipswich Town one of only two efforts under the former Brighton boss.
He was often deployed as a striker by Potter and only rarely featured wide on the right, arguably his best position but one in which West Ham already have skipper Jarrod Bowen.
The Ghanaian attempted the most dribbles in the Premier League for the second season running in 24-25 - 198 compared to 281 the season before - but his success rate dropped from 55.9% to 47%.
He was also much less effective off the ball last term, winning back possession on 148 occasions compared to 298 times in his debut campaign.
Perhaps his most telling contribution - if you can call it that - in his final year with the Hammers came in a 4-1 defeat against Spurs last October, when he was sent off for kicking out at defender Micky van de Ven and raising his hands to both the Dutchman and midfielder Pape Sarr.
Kudus, who was subsequently handed a five-match ban, later said he was ""deeply embarrassed"" by his actions.
'He can be a game-changer'
""Kudus can add attacking threat to Spurs either from the right flank, cutting inside, or from a more central position,"" explains former West Ham assistant Edu Rubio.
""He is very versatile and like Bryan Mbuemo - who became a very effective and important player for Thomas Frank at Brentford - can add goals, pace and work-rate when pressing high.
""Kudus can add an aggressive high-press style, since his approach to closing down the man on the ball is exceptional. He is rapid, intense and effective with it. He can add goals into the squad, too.
""He can be a game changer. He just needs to find that consistency needed at the top. He fits Thomas' 4-3-3 and 3-5-2 and also the manager's desire to have quick and direct attacks when possible; therefore I believe Kudus can reach his potential and the consistency under a manager like Frank.
""He may need to improve his variation on decision-making when on the ball, especially when playing centrally as he tends to get more exposed there and lose more possession easily.
""Overall he can add goals, work-rate off the ball, uniqueness and pour desire and  character into the squad. He is a very exciting player.""
Hitting form in Amsterdam after injury-hit start
Kudus is perhaps the most notable graduate of Ghana's Right To Dream academy, which was founded in 1999 by Manchester United's former head scout in Africa, Tom Vernon.
The academy, which purchased Danish top-flight side FC Nordsjaelland in 2015, also counts former Southampton winger Kamaldeen Sulemana among its alumni.
Kudus, who was just 12 when he started his journey at Right To Dream, used to idolise former Bayern Munich and Liverpool midfielder Sadio Mane as a youngster, telling West Ham's official website in 2019: ""I like players who entertain the fans and want to score.
""I know there's a lot at stake, but it's a sport at the end of the day, and it's entertainment, so I like players that get fans off their seats.""
One of three Right To Dream prospects to make the move to Nordsjaelland in 2018, Kudus was handed his senior bow just three days after his 18th birthday.
His first goal against Brondby in March 2019 - a smart finish at the near post after the youngster had started the move by chasing down a long ball - was a sign of things to come.
Nine efforts in 21 league appearances the following season earned him a move to Ajax, but knee and rib injuries restricted him to only 33 league appearances – and five goals – in 20-21 and 21-22.
He started the following campaign with a point to prove - and he made it impressively with 25 goal involvements across 42 appearances in all competitions, convincing West Ham to part with £38m for his services.
Despite a disappointing second season at London Stadium, new Spurs boss Frank clearly feels the 24-year-old will prove a valuable addition to an attack which scored 64 times in the league last term - as many as fourth-placed Chelsea and the seventh highest tally in the division.
First since 2011: Kudus makes rare move across capital
Daniel Levy has often been criticised by Tottenham fans for a perceived lack of investment in the playing squad, but when the chairman does do business it is rarely with the club's London rivals.
Kudus is the first player to move between West Ham and Tottenham since August 2011, when Scott Parker signed for Spurs following the Hammers' relegation from the Premier League.
You have to go back even further for the last transfer between Spurs and Chelsea, who have not struck any deals since goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini moved from Stamford Bridge to White Hart Lane in January 2009.
Former France international defender William Gallas was the last player to move across north London from Spurs' fierce rivals Arsenal, joining on a free transfer in August 2010.
The only other West Ham player to join Spurs in the past 20 years was back-up goalkeeper Jimmy Walker, who failed to make a first-team appearance under then-manager Harry Redknapp after signing in 2009.
Former England internationals Michael Carrick and Jermaine Defoe both moved from Upton Park to White Hart Lane in 2004, while striker Frederic Kanoute joined Tottenham from the Hammers in 2003.

Gibbs-White set for £60m Spurs move medical,Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White is set to have a medical at Tottenham on Friday before completing a £60m move.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c15wx34g94vo,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 17:10:44",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White is set to have a medical at Tottenham on Friday before completing a £60m move.
Well-placed sources have told BBC Sport the 25-year-old has a £60m release clause, which Spurs are set to trigger with the formalities of his switch to accelerate in the next 24 hours.
Gibbs-White, who has four England caps, was on Manchester City's radar this summer but Pep Guardiola's side have cooled their interest.
He scored seven goals and added eight assists in 34 Premier League games last season, and has attracted interest from a number of England's top clubs in recent months, but Spurs have stepped up their efforts to sign him.
Gibbs-White is set to follow Anthony Elanga out of the City Ground with Forest agreeing the latter's £55m sale to Newcastle earlier this week.
Spurs, who appointed Thomas Frank as new head coach last month, also signed Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for £55m and have an interest in Brentford attacker Yoane Wissa.
Gibbs-White joined Forest from Wolves for a then club-record fee of £25m plus add-ons in August 2022, on a five-year deal. He has made 118 appearances in three years at Forest, scoring 18 goals and providing 28 assists.
He made his England debut as a substitute in the Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in September under interim manager Lee Carsley, with his most recent appearance coming off the bench in the 3-1 friendly defeat by Senegal at the City Ground under new boss Thomas Tuchel.
Flair players with Premier League experience - analysis
Sami Mokbel, Senior football correspondent
So that will be £115m spent in 24 hours for Tottenham. It's all very un-Daniel Levy-like, isn't it?
With Kudus and now Gibbs-White on the way to north London, both are flair players that live up to Tottenham's attacking traditions. But crucially are players who have Premier League experience.
Indeed, that was the remit for Tottenham's recruitment team this summer.
The Spurs squad is already packed full of exciting young potential, what Thomas Frank believes it needs is experience.
While Kudus and Gibbs-White are relatively young - 24 and 25, respectively - they are well-versed in the rigours of England's top-flight.
Kudus has two full seasons for West Ham under his belt, making 80 appearances across all competitions, while Gibbs-White has played in the last three Premier League campaigns for Forest and had prior experience as a teenager at Wolves.
Spurs' interest in Brentford duo Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo is further illustration of Tottenham's recruitment remit.

Tottenham sign West Ham midfielder Kudus for £55m,"Tottenham complete the signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for £55m, subject to a work permit.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr793e22k2no,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 21:34:34",Lorraine McKenna,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham have completed the signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for £55m, subject to a work permit.
The Ghana midfielder, who had an £85m release clause, has joined Spurs on a six-year contract until 2031.
West Ham rejected an initial £50m from Tottenham last week.
Kudus, 24, made 65 Premier League appearances for the Hammers, scoring 13 goals and providing nine assists.
Speaking to the club's social media,, external Kudus said he has ""always wanted to play at the highest level.""
He added: ""How big the club is, the history and the Champions League as well, so it's a big moment. I'm very happy and can't wait to start.""
He could be joined by Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White, who is set to have a medical at Spurs on Friday before completing a £60m move.
Kudus has been a key member of West Ham's squad since he signed in a £38m deal from Ajax in August 2023. He made his top-flight debut as a substitute in a win over Luton Town a month later before scoring his first goals for the Hammers during the Europa League group stage shortly after.
In his first season at West Ham he scored 14 goals, including nine assists.
Sources told BBC Sport that Kudus had prioritised a move to north London despite at least six top clubs enquiring about him.
He cited head coach Thomas Frank, who replaced former Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou last month, as one of the main reasons for joining Tottenham.
""From where [Frank] has come from, and seeing the amount of talent he has developed to become great players, it's a big sign as to why I wanted to work under him as well,"" said Kudus.

Arsenal sign Brentford midfielder Norgaard,Denmark midfielder Christian Norgaard joins Arsenal on an initial two-year contract in a deal worth up to £15m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g8wnxg0mmo,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 12:01:59",Paul Battison,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have signed Denmark midfielder Christian Norgaard from Brentford in a £15m deal.
The 31-year-old has joined for an initial £10m - with a possible £5m in performance-related add-ons - on a two-year contract with the option of a third year.
Norgaard joined Brentford from Fiorentina in 2019 and became a key player, captaining his side and making 196 appearances.
He is Arsenal's third signing of the summer after deals for Spaniards Martin Zubimendi and Kepa Arrizabalaga.
Norgaard said he got ""almost emotional"" because signing for Arsenal means he will live his ""dream"" of playing Champions League football.
""I've just turned 31 and had signed a new deal with Brentford,"" he said.
""There's always a little chance that a miracle could happen with Brentford, but it was probably unrealistic to play Champions League with them.
""Now I get to hear the anthem and be a part of a Champions League campaign. It's a childhood dream and something I didn't think would be possible. So it's something I'm really, really happy about.""
Norgaard helped Brentford win promotion from the Championship in 2021, before making 122 Premier League appearances.
Midfielder Zubimendi joined Arsenal from Real Sociedad last week in a deal worth almost £60m, and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga moved from Chelsea for £5m.
Arsenal are also in talks to sign Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres for £70m and have made a formal approach for Chelsea winger Noni Madueke.
What will Norgaard bring to Arsenal?
Arteta said, external he is ""delighted"" to sign Norgaard because of his ""proven leadership skills and strong character"".
""He is a strong midfielder with excellent tactical awareness and versatility. He also has physical presence and intelligence, which will give us added depth and balance,"" said Arteta.
Norgaard was linked with a reunion with former manager Thomas Frank at Tottenham this summer.
Since his Premier League debut in 2021, Norgaard has made 201 interceptions - the most of any Premier League player during this period - and he ranks second for recoveries (844) and third for tackles won (189).
Six goals in all competitions in 2024-25 was the best return of his career in one season.
'He can be a great addition'
Edu Rubio, former West Ham, Crystal Palace and Wolves coach
Norgaard is a modern defensive-anchor player. He can break up play, intercept, tackle, block and win aerial duels. He can let Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice do their thing while he protects their backs.
He can also recycle the ball and play forwards effectively. In a league where there are so many transitions, a player who senses danger and has a great ability to regain the ball can be a must-have in your team.
His physicality, and the fact it has been tested in the Premier League, also makes him a very sensible signing. He can be a great addition to Arsenal.
Norgaard will fit perfectly with Zubimendi. They can even play together if Arteta opts for two holding players and one 10, instead of one anchor and two number eights.
Zubimendi is more of a passer and creator. Norgaard is more a break-up-play midfielder who can regain possession, secure possession and stop the opposition from easily breaking into the final third.
Arteta is making sure he will have enough strength in the midfield area to compete in all four competitions.

Real Madrid’s PSG thrashing shows Xabi Alonso true size of rebuilding job,"New manager faces tough questions before next season, with the biggest just how to find the right fit for superstar striker Kylian Mbappé",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/10/real-madrids-psg-thrashing-shows-xabi-alonso-true-size-of-rebuilding-job,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 21:11:22",Sid Lowe,['Arsenal'],"This is the end. For Real Madrid, the best thing that could be said about their last game of the 2024-2025 season was that it was their last game of the 2024-2025 season. So in the makeshift marquee set up by the MetLife Stadium, Xabi Alonso said exactly that, and repeatedly. He had watched his team, who aren’t entirely his team yet, be taken apart by Paris Saint-Germain; now he wanted to get home and “reset”, forget about it. Well, not forget exactly: the hurt might help, lessons learned. “I want this to have an impact but not drag us down,” he said. “In August we start 2025-26, which will be different.”
The way they fell was familiar, back to their recent past, their reality. “We suffered the way others have suffered against them,” Alonso said, and that was true, but it is not only PSG; it is Madrid too. This was their 68th game of the season and their 15th loss. They won only the Uefa Super Cup, a world away now, and the Intercontinental Cup against Pachuca in Qatar. In the league, Barcelona beat them twice, scoring four each time. In the cup, Barcelona put three past them; in the Super Cup, five. Arsenal scored three in the Champions League. PSG stopped at four because they didn’t need more.
The Club World Cup was a tournament and a testing ground. Alonso hadn’t been keen to take over in the US, but once it was made clear that he must, he described it as an opportunity to accelerate the processes he had planned, implement ideas early. The demand is always to win, exposed before the eyes of the world, but at least to begin with games were analysed as much through what was new, what was coming, as whether they lifted the trophy. The discourse from the new coach was recurring, all about collectivity, spirit, a structure. Every time he was asked about an individual, he turned to the group. Everyone must work, without exception.
There were details too, something developing: a shifting attitude and new formation that sometimes featured three at the back, Aurélien Tchouaméni playing what Alonso called a “hybrid” role, stepping in and out of the defence. Gonzalo García was a revelation. Dean Huijsen can really play. Fran García was good. Fede Valverde was released. Arda Guler may be a deep playmaker, occupying the position for which Madrid had no one else. The spaces between them narrowed. They were actually pressing sometimes.
They reached the semi-finals. Yes, they might have expected that. And no, they hadn’t beaten truly great teams. But Juventus and Borussia Dortmund are decent tests and, apart from a mad last 10 minutes in the latter game, were eliminated with an authority not seen for too long. Madrid had a manager. It was startling, and pretty grubby, how quickly Carlo Ancelotti – the coach who won it all – was condemned and the team considered fixed.
And then came PSG, and it all fell apart. That’s not pressing; this is pressing. Can you really say that a goal was coming, overdue even, when it is scored inside six minutes? You can when it is like this: by the time Fabián Ruiz scored the first, it was PSG’s fourth clear chance. Madrid couldn’t get to the ball or PSG’s players. “We didn’t manage to apply the manager’s plan,” Thibaut Courtois said. “We couldn’t press like them; from my point of view, we always arrived a little late, everyone out of position and that’s how they beat you. We weren’t close to them.”
The mistakes that led to the opening two goals were truly absurd from Raúl Asencio and Toni Rüdiger. There were other conditioning factors: Trent Alexander-Arnold and Huijsen were missing, one injured, one suspended. Valverde had to play at right-back. The formation was changed. And Kylian Mbappé was back. Now, it would be far too easy to say that Madrid lost the first time that Mbappé started but: Madrid lost the first time that Mbappé started. No, it wasn’t about him. But, yes, it kind of was. Which is the way it has been all season, his first in Spain. There’s something quite bizarre about wondering if a striker who scored 44 goals, the best debut campaign a Madrid player has ever had, was a success, but it’s not an entirely illegitimate question. “I came to win trophies,” he said, and he hasn’t.
Mbappé came to a team who malfunctioned in multiple ways and his significance is always magnified, distorted, for good and bad. Against PSG, the team that went and won it all as soon as he left, all the more so. Here it hit everyone, hard. There’s a symbolism that goes beyond his actual performance, but that doesn’t make it purely symbolic and there is something systemic there, too. Madrid hadn’t found a fit for him and Vinícius Júnior, whose form has not been the same and collapsed almost completely since he didn’t win the Ballon d’Or. Defeat in New York brought that, and other flaws, back to the surface.
“Today is a hostia that could help us learn, correct things and keep improving,” Courtois said. The hostia is the consecrated bread; in this context, it is a kick in the teeth, a massive blow. In its clarity, in how much it hurt, it could be helpful, no place to hide. Lessons came from both teams on the pitch, from what Madrid are and what, looking at PSG, they aspire to be. That this was no one-off but cruel confirmation of what has been seen all season may help. It cannot be ignored. No, things are not fixed so fast; they have to be dealt with properly, not patched over.
“Sometimes it is good to see the errors, for that to help you in the future. If you keep tripping on the same mistake, it’s not intelligent,” Alonso said. And if he was already given an authority not always conferred on coaches, his ideas engaged with, so far at least, this was a reminder to keep listening. Often it is an excuse to turn on a coach but not here, not yet: only six of the 68 matches this season are his, after all. “He hasn’t had time to do anything,” Luis Enrique said in his defence.
“This is the last game of 2024-25, not the first of 2025-26,” Alonso said, and it was a recurring line. There might have been some self-preservation in saying so but there was also a message, a reminder of where they are coming from and how far they have to go, that there can be a new beginning, that failure can be left behind. If it’s not forgotten entirely. A reminder that there must be changes: in culture, dressing-room dynamics. At board level, the word “ego” is being discussed, an easy excuse perhaps, a handy distraction from failures higher up, but not insignificant. Alonso talked about wanting to “build a team that plays with unity, all together, that has feeling and spirit”.
He also talked for the first time about changes in personnel too, if briefly. Some will depart – Luka Modric, Lucas Vázquez, almost certainly Rodrygo – and additions must be made. Some positions are not adequately occupied while others are overbooked. Asked about signings, Alonso replied: “We haven’t talked much about the composition of the squad during the World Cup but now we are always open to talking about making improvements and there is space for that.
“Our new era is just beginning, there is still a lot of margin, lots of things we have to do better. Today hurts, we have to be self-critical, but this shows us things. We will take things from this match and from this World Cup. We leave here a better team, even if it is hard to say that right now. It can be a starting point for us, a way of beginning next season better. Today is the end of this season, not the start of next. This competition has told me a lot of things about what we are and what we have to improve. I leave here with many certainties. We will start from zero in August, when 2025-26 begins. Not from the 95th minute of today, but from zero.”

The England winger has already agreed terms on a five-year deal and is likely to complete a move to the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal, who are also expected to ramp up their pursuit of Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze, have been looking to add more depth on the flanks and have acted quickly after identifying Madueke as a key target.
The 23-year-old’s appeal lies in his ability to provide cover for Bukayo Saka on the right and offer an option for Mikel Arteta on the left. Madueke has decided to seek a new challenge with his hopes of regular football at Chelsea limited by them adding Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens, Estêvão and João Pedro to their attack this summer. Geovany Quenda is due to join from Sporting Lisbon next year.
Chelsea need to generate revenue through sales after being fined by default for breaching financial fair play rules last week. Selling Madueke, who joined from PSV Eindhoven in January 2023, for a profit will boost their financial position.
Chelsea believe that Madueke has not progressed enough. He has had a bit part role at the Club World Cup and us unlikely to be involved in Sunday’s final against Paris Saint-Germain.

"In the stands with my son, the Club World Cup was as human as it could possibly be","Unexpectedly cheap tickets gave my boy an overwhelming soccer experience, and me a jolt of faith in a flawed tournament",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/10/club-world-cup-attending-chelsea-fluminense-metlife-stadium-neurodivergent-son,"Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:00:16",Leander Schaerlaeckens,['Chelsea'],"My son had never been to a professional soccer game.
Soccer is, shall we say, not really his thing. It’s also never been particularly important to me that he likes soccer, that he likes what I like. Our sons will be their own men, come what may.
But the sport has brought me untold joy, not to mention paid a good chunk of our mortgage. So I have tried to gently expose him to it here and there. He played a single season of low-stakes rec soccer. I must confess that I lightly bribed him into that by letting him pick out his own cleats – he chose neon green ones, for his favorite color then, even though I warned he wouldn’t be able to see his own feet in the grass. He made a gamely effort every week. On the drive home after the final session, he announced his retirement as a player. Literally. “Mama, Papa, I’m retired from soccer.” Oh well.
Lukie, who turns nine in two weeks, is kind, social and bright. He possesses a soaring curiosity and creativity. He is neurodivergent, too – ADHD. When he was younger, loud noises spooked him. A train pulling into a station. A solid round of applause. Loud music. Thunder. But he seemed to have grown out of that, although he still hates hand dryers in public bathrooms.
I’d been toying with the idea of taking my family to a Club World Cup game. I am on the record with my skepticism of this steroidal, money-munching monstrosity, while I have also acknowledged that the soccer on show – and the fans, perhaps more pertinently – have been redeeming.
But there was nonetheless an appeal in the chance to see some of the world’s biggest clubs playing for something competitive, and so close to home. So I looked for tickets and discovered that the dynamic prices for Tuesday’s semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense had utterly collapsed from nearly $500 a few days earlier, just to get into New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, to as little as $13. At those prices, who could resist?
I snagged three tickets in the lower bowl for a comical $40 apiece for Lukie, myself and my wife. Lukie was excited about going to see a high-stakes game in good seats at the big stadium. We’d go right after he finished his morning robotics camp. We were entrusting Lukie’s maiden experience of the sport at the highest level to Fifa president Gianni Infantino and his fever dream for what he thinks soccer should be.
On the drive down, I expounded on the virtues of soccer, on the magic of not knowing whether the theater you had bought a ticket to would give you nine goals or none. There was no plot; certainly no script.
“Oh, listen to Mr. Soccer Man,” Lukie said, teasing me. “Bragging about soccer.” Then he put on his headphones and streamed a dino show on his Kindle. (Lukie, who has read and approved this column, wants you to know he is “deeply into dinosaurs right now.”)
We paid the extortionate parking fee of $65, which was apparently not prone to market fluctuations and, in fact, has risen by $5 for each subsequent round of Club World Cup games held at MetLife. I checked my phone. 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36C). Feels like 98.
Lukie was charmed by the competing music and scents of grilling meats around the parking lot, as other children doused themselves with water. He stood and watched the dancing and singing Fluminense fans for a while. We weaved through the various human funnels of the security checks and exclusion zones.
Once inside, he got to feel the child’s awe at walking into a mega stadium for the first time, laying eyes on the colossal rings of stands framing the verdant field. His mouth fell open.
After that, it was just too much of everything. A DJ blasted the same old stadium tunes, suggesting there was no need for a DJ at all (Except to occasionally shout “Fifa Club World Cup 2025, here we gooo!”) Michael Buffer, better known as the “let’s-get-ready-to-ruuumbleee” guy from boxing, was there doing his thing for some reason. Flames burst skyward, sparks shot into the air, fireworks boomed. Players ambled into the broiling heat amid overcooked introductions. Explosions of smoke in the clubs’ colors wafted through the air.

All of it assaulted Lukie’s senses at once. In his seat, he tucked his legs into his chest and covered his ears. João Pedro’s first Chelsea goal, and the ensuing roar from the crowd, finally fried his circuits. He burst into tears.
My wife took him out on to the concourse for an $11 ice cream and found MetLife Stadium staff. Peter and Christine, American heroes both, convinced Lukie to give the game another try, handing him noise-canceling headphones, some sunglasses, and all of us new seats up on a platform in a quieter and roomier area for people with disabilities.
These MetLife Stadium workers spoke to a child with empathy and enthusiasm, even as madness swirled all about them. Among the 70,556 fans – the ticket price dump had evidently worked – they managed to make one scared boy feel seen and heard. Humanity shone through in amid the artifice and the avarice.
When João Pedro scored again, sealing Chelsea’s place in the Club World Cup final against PSG on Sunday, Lukie saw it clearly. But the goal entered his consciousness without the same noise or brightness. His brain got a chance to process what it had seen, without getting drowned out by sound and sight. He cracked a smile.
Soccer, in the end, was still not for him. That’s OK. He got to try it, on his terms.
To me, someone who tends to observe the sport from up in the press box, away from the maelstrom of the masses, it was a helpful reminder of what soccer feels like on the ground level. And that for all the commercialism and corporatism we rightly cover and criticize in the media, even sport at the highest level is still played by people, attended by people and put on by people who are trying their best.

When Real Madrid refused en masse to turn up for last year’s Ballon d’Or ceremony because they knew their man on the shortlist hadn’t won the main award, their snub was widely and correctly perceived to have been an act of the most extreme petulance. And while their players and coaching staff did deign to attend last night’s Copa Gianni semi-final at the MetLife EnormoDome, they certainly didn’t turn up in any meaningful sense of the word and were duly humiliated by Paris Saint-Germain, the Bigger Cup holders Kylian Mbappé famously abandoned last summer to pursue his dream of … winning Bigger Cup. Subjected to the footballing equivalent of being attacked by a swarm of angry bees, Real simply had no answers for PSG’s terrifyingly energetic onslaught across 90 minutes.
By the time nine of them had elapsed, Thibaut Courtois had already made two world-class saves but was helpless to prevent Fabián Ruiz and Ousmane Dembélé spanking two shots past him after capitalising on some comically slapstick defending by Raúl Asencio and Tony Rüdiger. As the German was harried into an embarrassing air-hoof in the face of mild pressure from Dembélé, Football Daily could only hazard a guess at the thoughts going through the famously self-aware Mbappé’s mind. Perhaps a blissfully unironic: “Why weren’t they this tenacious when I played for them?” In the end PSG booked their place in the final courtesy of a 4-0 win that, if anything, flattered their exalted opponents. As the hoary old saw goes, Real Madrid always find a way … even if, on this occasion, it was one that made themselves look like a set of stationary white cones laid out for a PSG training session.
“I leave here with lots of certainties and next year will be different,” said Xabi Alonso, who after just six games in charge of Real knows that in Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior he is both blessed and cursed with two extraordinarily gifted players who steadfastly refuse to do their share of the grunt work. Compare and contrast with each and every member of the PSG squad, who never have to be reminded to clip the hedge, do the laundry or put the bins out. “We didn’t put the brakes on but of course with the heat, with the final in three days’ time, with cramp and the risk of tiredness, you act,” said Luis Enrique after the game, as he appeared to simultaneously confirm and deny that his team had actually taken it easy on Real in the second half.
Asked to explain the key to his team’s success, he highlighted its “insuperable” play. And while it’s not often that the post-match musings of a football manager prompt Football Daily to reach for its trusty Oxford English Dictionary, it came as no surprise to see the definition in question illustrated by a swarm of angry bees. The Spaniard went on to laud the manner in which his players “give everything at the service of the team”, in praise as pointed as a tungsten needle. In a fairytale final pitting two of Europe’s pluckiest underdogs together, PSG must now beat Chelsea to complete an impressive and unprecedented quadruple. “We are going to try,” said Luis Enrique. “One more step against a good team like Chelsea. They perform the whole competition and now it is time for us to prepare, try to recover. [We are] almost there. We want to make history in our club and then take our holidays.” Having consigned so many elite teams to the beach in the past couple of months, it seems only fair PSG get their turn on the deckchairs.

Chelsea did offer me another contract, but I decided to go to Aston Villa because they were in the Championship. And I had an agreement with Villa that if we got promoted that year – we lost in the playoff final to Fulham – that I wouldn’t play against Chelsea the following year in the Premier League. So the two games I would have missed the next year would have been Chelsea, it just wouldn’t have felt right” – Plain Old John Terry tells TalkSport that his Aston Villa contract included a ‘won’t play against Chelsea’ clause.
FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS
“Re John Muller’s story, I was the first head coach of the USL’s Columbus Xoggz in 1994. That year Fifa experimented with the game’s laws and decided that each regional division in the USL would play with its own two modified laws. We played 1993 USL champs Atlanta, at their place, where all throw-ins were now kick-ins! With no offside for throw-ins, we unsurprisingly thumped every one into their box. I believe the final score was 4-2 to the good guys” – Christophe Brown.
“Luis Enrique denied that PSG took their foot off the gas as his side schooled Real Madrid in the art of attacking football. But it seems someone may have been inclined to spare Real from further punishment. We saw 10 substitutions in the second half. That ought to mean a few minutes of added time (not to mention more time being added for injury stoppages and a cooling break). Yet the referee blew his whistle right on the 90-minute mark. I hope it wasn’t aimed at preventing Madrid’s brand from suffering further embarrassment” – Mark McFadden.
“Perhaps Bryan Evans should also have pointed out to Frankie Dodds and the aforementioned Mr Glendenning that the M1 (Republic of Ireland version) does not ‘become’ the A1 at the border but terminates several kilometres to the south, near the village of Ballymascanlan.
