Slot admits 'adjustment' needed to attacking-but-vulnerable Liverpool,"Arne Slot masterfully tweaked Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool to deliver a Premier League title last season. Now his new-look side may require some more adjusting to repeat that feat, on the basis of their Community Shield display.&#160;",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13409916/liverpool-community-shield-defeat-to-crystal-palace-shows-arne-slot-must-find-balance-between-attack-and-defence,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 21:20:00",Peter Smith,['Liverpool'],"Arne Slot masterfully tweaked Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool to deliver a Premier League title last season. Now his new-look side may require some more adjusting to repeat that feat, on the basis of their Community Shield display.
Liverpool - powered by the attacking attributes of summer signings Hugo Ekitike, Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong - were impressive on the front foot at Wembley, slick in their combinations and eye-catching with their progress up the pitch.
But they were also vulnerable defensively, twice conceding equalisers to Crystal Palace to undo their good offensive play and then beaten in the shoot-out. Palace could have scored more, with Alisson sharp to deny Eberechi Eze and Alexis Mac Allister fortunate to not give away a late penalty.
""It needs maybe a little bit of adjustment defensively,"" was Slot's post-match assessment on his side's reimagined set up.
Liverpool supporters and followers of their pre-season campaign won't be surprised by that. It has been a recurring pattern in recent weeks: the Premier League champions looking more effective than previously with the ball yet leaving themselves exposed when they lose it.
""A lot of the goals conceded by Liverpool have come from going man-to-man, really aggressively, and leaving space in behind,"" explained Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher on social media.
Against counter-attack experts Palace that was a problem. But it could become a greater one if a solution isn't found swiftly. Bournemouth come to Anfield on Friday to kick off the Premier League season - another team able to break quickly - and then it's Newcastle away, before a big early clash with title rivals Arsenal.
While Kerkez and Frimpong add thrust down both flanks, their adventures forward can leave the centre-backs and holding midfielder exposed when there is a turnover.
With Ryan Gravenberch set to return after missing Sunday's game because of the birth of his child, albeit he is suspended for the season opener with Bournemouth, and an off-colour Virgil van Dijk - who did give away a penalty - likely to improve after just recovering from illness, Slot is confident he can find the right mix.
There were three clear-cut chances in all for Palace on Sunday, compared to Liverpool's two. Palace also had more shots than Liverpool. But Slot played down the volume of big chances Liverpool were giving up, even if the goals against tally is higher than he'd like.
""We've replaced four players,"" said Slot of Liverpool's £265m summer overhaul, which has seen Trent Alexander-Arnold, Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez and Caoimhin Kelleher leave the club.
""You need some time, either to adapt offensively [or] to adapt defensively.
""But against [Athletic Club, in the 3-2 win], we didn't concede one chance at all. Maybe one, I don't know. But we conceded two set-pieces, which are also a big part of football, but that's not from open play.
""I don't feel we conceded that much today, but again, conceded two goals because the first big chance they got resulted in the penalty. And maybe I forget a few chances, but it felt to me that in the 78th minute that was their second big chance of the game. But in general, there were not many chances because they went to a low block.
""We don't concede a lot of chances, but we do concede goals at the moment.""
Liverpool were the top scorers in the Premier League last season and had the second-best defensive record.
""What made us really strong last season was we only won mostly by a margin of one goal and that had mostly to do with us keeping a clean sheet or as a maximum conceding one goal,"" added Slot.
""Today we scored twice against Palace, last season we were not able to do that once - we beat them 1-0 and we had a 1-1 draw at Anfield. That's the positive.""
It appears they still have the firepower - perhaps even more. But finding out how to balance that off with defensive solidity looks key to whether Slot and Liverpool can become back-to-back champions.

Jota tribute cut short after Wembley boos,A minute's silence held in tribute to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva was interrupted by a minority of Crystal Palace fans before being cut short ahead the Community Shield against Liverpool.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13409727/diogo-jota-tribute-cut-short-ahead-of-liverpools-community-shield-match-with-crystal-palace,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 15:20:00",,['Liverpool'],"A minute's silence held in tribute to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva was interrupted by a minority of Crystal Palace fans before being cut short ahead the Community Shield against Liverpool.
Reds forward Jota died in a car crash along with his brother Silva in Spain in July.
The moment of silence at Wembley was disturbed by a minority of fans from the Palace end, eliciting a strong response at the other end of the pitch, as well as other Palace supporters, who tried to silence those not respecting the tribute.
Referee Chris Kavanagh opted to cut the minute short, with the tribute ending after just 20 seconds.
Liverpool fans also booed the national anthem ahead of kick off.
Sky Sports' Peter Smith at Wembley reported: ""Unsavoury moments there, as a few Crystal Palace fans called out 'Eagles' during the minute's silence for Diogo Jota, which drew boos from the Liverpool end.
""It followed Liverpool fans booing the national anthem, which drew an angry response from some in the Palace end.""
Liverpool boss Arne Slot said of the incident: ""I'm a positive person. If I look at the respect that's been paid to them both from around the world, that's what I have in my head.
""I don't think this was planned or this was the idea of the fan who made some noise, maybe he wasn't aware it was the minute of silence. Then the fans of Palace were trying to calm that person down, but that was a bit noisy as well and then our fans reacted on what's happening.
""I don't think there's a bad intention to it.""
Sky Sports News has contacted Crystal Palace for comment.
Before kick off, Liverpool supporters paid respect with a rousing rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' as the wreaths were brought out, raising a white banner reading 'Diogo J' and featuring the forward's image and number 20.
Liverpool great Ian Rush, Palace chairman Steve Parish and Football Association chair Debbie Hewitt laid the wreaths in the Liverpool end as fans from both clubs expressed their respect with a standing ovation as the late siblings' images were displayed on the big screens inside the stadium.
After the game ended 2-2, Palace won the Community Shield by beating Liverpool on penalties.
Liverpool boss Slot said on Thursday he was immensely proud of how his Premier League champions had dealt with the tragedy.
He said: ""This summer has been a difficult for everybody connected with the club. The passing of Diogo Jota had a big impact on all of us and is something that we are still coming to terms with.
""We cannot imagine the pain that Diogo's family, his wife, children and friends are going through, and the club will continue to give them all the support they can going forward.
""Diogo's passing has had a big impact on us all, but what has been so important has been the love and care shown from the football world, and in particular of course the Liverpool FC community.
""I also want to mention the strength and the courage of my players here. They have found themselves in one of the toughest positions imaginable, but the way they have come together and the way they have conducted themselves, on and off the pitch, is a credit to them and to this football club.
""We really couldn't have asked more of the boys and I am extremely proud of them all.
""We will always carry Diogo with us in our hearts, in our thoughts, wherever we go.""

Liverpool 2.0 launched at Wembley - and Slot has bugs to fix,Arne Slot's new-look Liverpool got their grand unveiling in the Community Shield defeat by Crystal Palace at Wembley - and the reviews are in.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czjmm30l87no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 19:56:16",Emma Smith,['Liverpool'],"Arne Slot's Liverpool 2.0 got their grand unveiling at Wembley on Sunday and the reviews are in. Occasionally brilliant, occasionally shambolic, with improvements needed.
Four of Liverpool's summer signings made their first competitive starts for the club in the Community Shield, which they lost on penalties to Crystal Palace.
Record £116m acquisition Florian Wirtz started in attacking midfield, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez formed a new-look full-back pairing, while Hugo Ekitike led the line as the central striker.
The only new face not in the starting XI was goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, who was on the bench as Alisson kept his place.
And there were some clear signs the revamp may lead to spectacular results. The game finished 2-2, with the goals coming through Ekitike and Frimpong. It is the first time Liverpool have had two players score on their competitive debuts since August 2006, when Craig Bellamy and Mark Gonzalez netted against Maccabi Haifa.
But Liverpool 2.0 have bugs. They twice had leads pegged back, were often sloppy in defence, and were on the ropes towards the end.
""We have four new players - we need time to adapt,"" Slot said at his post-match media conference at Wembley.
In this regard, the Community Shield was not an isolated incident. In Monday's 3-2 friendly win against Athletic Bilbao, Liverpool conceded twice from set-pieces.
Palace arguably had only two big chances in this game - Jean-Philippe Mateta's 13th-minute penalty and Ismaila Sarr bursting through with 12 minutes to go. They scored both.
As Slot pithily said: ""We don't concede chances, but we concede goals.""
New full-backs, new style of play?
Let's start at the back. For years, especially under Jurgen Klopp, one of Liverpool's defining traits was the attacking impetus brought by full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson.
Frimpong and Kerkez are, in many ways, in a similar mould - much more attacking than traditional full-backs.
But, while Kerkez is near identical to Robertson in how he plays, Frimpong stays far wider than his predecessor. Don't expect many Alexander-Arnold-like adventures into central midfield - but do expect some good, old-fashioned overlapping runs.
This attacking sense led directly to Liverpool's second goal when Frimpong jinked into the area and chipped Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson. Whether he meant to score or not, the dash into the box was a spectacular and impudent piece of skill.
However, in defence, issues remain. Liverpool will have hoped that Frimpong would bring the defensive solidity they sometimes lacked with Alexander-Arnold, but the Dutchman played Sarr onside for the second equaliser.
And it was not only at full-back where Liverpool looked defensively suspect. They were opened too easily before the first-half penalty - Mateta was set free by a through ball, leading to the attack which ended in Virgil van Dijk fouling Sarr.
There was not a recognised centre-back on Liverpool's bench. Jarell Quansah has departed for Bayer Leverkusen and Joe Gomez ""has a minor injury"".
Slot expects him to be back soon, but Liverpool need to sign at least one more central defender before the transfer deadline on 1 September.
The one they would like to sign captained the opposition at Wembley. Marc Guehi - subject of transfer speculation as he enters the last year of his contract - once again laid everything on the line for Palace before being subbed in the dying seconds because of cramp.
Is 'dominant' Wirtz missing piece?
Moving into midfield, Wirtz was the outstanding Liverpool player at Wembley. Slot has clearly tweaked the system to suit their record signing - and the early signs are positive.
Wirtz has been given a role freer and further forward than Liverpool had previously from an attacking midfielder - they had nobody to do that role last season.
He almost formed a strike partnership with Ekitike at times, so close together were they. Indeed by the time he was substituted, Wirtz was playing as a false nine with Ekitike already taken off.
This freedom allowed the German to float wide left after four minutes, to pick up the ball and play in Ekitike for the opener.
There were 22 passes in the build-up to Liverpool's first goal, a move that lasted 66 seconds and involved nine players.
Until being taken off in the 84th minute, Wirtz looked perfectly balanced, always in control, never flustered. His influence all over the pitch for Liverpool is already clear.
At the point of his substitution, Wirtz led Liverpool for passes and entries in the final third, crosses and touches in the Palace box. He had the third most touches in total. Everything went through him.
""It has been a really impressive performance for Wirtz,"" former Palace striker Glenn Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Very dominant.
""He was tiring by the end of it and that is something he will need to get used to. But he is looking like a very good signing.""
This does put a question on Mohamed Salah's role in the team. The Egyptian has now not scored in eight Wembley appearances, had only one shot on target and in the shootout blazed his penalty over. But that is a question for another article.
How much of a difference did Ekitike make?
In front of Wirtz, Ekitike has the makings of a genuine, out-and-out centre forward Liverpool simply did not have before because of Darwin Nunez's shortcomings.
His goal was well taken, and his cross with the outside of his boot in the first half that found Cody Gakpo in an offside position was sumptuous.
But one should remember that Nunez's debut also came in the Community Shield - the 2023 win over Manchester City. The Uruguayan scored, looked streets ahead of Erling Haaland - and never hit those heights again.
And there was a touch of Nunez about Ekitike spurning a header inside the six-yard box less than a minute into the second half, and another chance he blazed over from 12 yards. Take one of those, and Liverpool win.
""Always nice to score a goal, but it would have been even nicer to win a game,"" Slot said of his new frontman.
""Ekitike had a good impact, but he came two weeks ago during the Asia tour. But he had a good game for sure.""
So who will Liverpool add in the final three weeks of the transfer window? One name is on everyone's lips - Alexander Isak.
At times on Sunday, it looked as if the last thing Liverpool needed was another first-choice striker. But as Palace celebrated in the sun, the appeal of the wantaway Newcastle forward became clearer.
""Liverpool want another striker,"" former Reds goalkeeper Chris Kirkland told BBC Sport after the game. ""We're all greedy. Every team wants as many strikers as they can.
""Liverpool want Isak, they have bid for him, and he wants to go. Normally, when that is the case, a deal gets done. I'd want a centre-back and a forward because we are all greedy in this world!""
A long way to go, Liverpool fans...
There were also weaknesses deeper in midfield for Liverpool, but they are a cheaper fix.
Ryan Gravenberch was absent because his partner was giving birth, while Alexis Mac Allister was only fit enough for a cameo off the bench.
Curtis Jones lined up alongside Dominik Szoboszlai in holding midfield, and completed all 53 of his passes.
""Gravenberch was a massive miss today - he was my player of the season last year,"" said Kirkland.
There can be no question Liverpool will be disappointed to miss out on a trophy, especially against the side who finished 12th last season and have several injury issues, with Eddie Nketiah and Cheick Doucoure among those set to miss the start of the season.
But Reds fans should not take it too harshly. For starters, only one of the past 14 winners of the season opener have gone on to lift the Premier League trophy - Manchester City in 2018-19. In the Premier League era, only eight of the 33 winners of the Charity or Community Shield have gone on to win the title.
And in more relevant terms, Slot 2.0 is still at the troubleshooting stage - there are 38 product launches to come.

'We celebrate' - Glasner would not swap Wembley win for Europa bid,Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner says would not swap the Community Shield win over Liverpool for a spot in the Europa League before their appeal result.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce933n7enylo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 18:50:30",Charlotte Coates,['Liverpool'],"Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner says he would not swap their Community Shield victory for a spot in next season's Europa League.
The FA Cup holders claimed their second trophy in three months - and first Community Shield - by overcoming Premier League champions Liverpool on penalties after the match ended 2-2 at Wembley.
Palace will find out on Monday whether they will be allowed to play in Europe's second-tier cup competition in 2025-26.
The Eagles were demoted to the Uefa Conference League as punishment for breaching multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor owns a stake in the club and is the majority owner of Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League.
An appeal was submitted against their demotion with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).
The appeal is against Uefa, which issued the punishment, French club Lyon and Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest - with a decision expected on Monday.
When asked whether he would swap the Wembley win for a successful appeal, Glasner replied: ""No. The players were not scared of noise around us.
""Tomorrow we have no influence, so we celebrate tonight, meet tomorrow for lunch then training. We can't think about it.""
'It would devalue the competition'
Penalty shootout hero Dean Henderson added Palace's potential demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League would ""devalue the competition"".
""I think you will see by today, we don't take too much notice of it at the end of the day,"" Henderson told BBC Radio 5 Live at Wembley. ""We win the FA Cup, we are justified to be in the Europa League.
""For football purposes we deserve to be in the Europa League. I think it would devalue the competition unfortunately if we weren't in the Europa League.
""Things that are won on the pitch should be rewarded and I think every neutral football fan would agree with that. Let's see. I know the chairman [Steve Parish] has fought hard against it and fingers crossed we are in the Europa League like we deserve to be.
""I know Crystal Palace fans have waited 120 years, maybe even longer, for the first trophy and chance to go on a European tour.
""To have that taken away from us is just not right for football and I think everyone would agree with that. I am sure they will see sense and put us back in the Europa League.""

Fans disrupting Jota silence had 'no bad intention' - Slot,Liverpool manager Arne Slot does not believe that Crystal Palace fans intended to disrupt the minute's silence held in remembrance of Diogo Jota and Andre Silva before the Community Shield.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93ddqwvx33o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 18:13:12",Alex Brotherton,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool manager Arne Slot does not believe that Crystal Palace fans intended to disrupt the minute's silence held in remembrance of Diogo Jota and Andre Silva before Sunday's Community Shield.
Referee Chris Kavanagh cut short the silence after supporters at Wembley booed shouts coming from the east end of the stadium, where the Palace fans were located.
Former Liverpool forward Jota and his brother Silva died in a car crash in northern Spain last month, aged 28 and 25 respectively.
Speaking to the media after his side lost the traditional season curtain-raiser 3-2 on penalties, Liverpool manager Slot said he believes the interruption to be accidental.
""I don't think this was planned, or that this was the idea of the fan that made some noise. Maybe he wasn't aware of the fact that it was the minute of silence,"" Slot said.
""He was just still happy and tried to cheer for his team. And I think then the fans of Palace were trying to calm that person or those persons down, so I don't think he had a bad intention, the guy or people that made noise.
""They tried to calm him down, but that was a bit noisy as well. And then our fans reacted, 'Hey, what's happening here?'
""So I don't think there's a bad intention to it, because the fans of Crystal Palace and everywhere around the world have paid huge respect to Diogo and Andre and this was I think unlucky or, I can't find the right words, but I don't think there was a bad intention in it.
""We will see Friday, when Bournemouth come to our stadium, how respectful that is going to happen.
""It's also five weeks ago, so that's why maybe this fan who was just so happy for them to be in the Community Shield that he forgot in a second.""
'Some things are meant to be'
FA Cup holders Palace twice came from behind in a 2-2 draw at Wembley before goalkeeper Dean Henderson saved two penalties in the shootout to defeat the Premier League champions.
Liverpool's £64m summer signing Hugo Ekitike gave his side an early lead, before Jean-Philippe Mateta converted a penalty awarded for a Virgil van Dijk foul.
Slot's side retook the lead shortly afterwards when Jeremie Frimpong's cross floated over Henderson and went in off the post, but it was the timing of the goal that was most significant.
Frimpong's goal was timed at 20 minutes and 20 seconds, the same number Jota wore during his five seasons at Anfield.
""It is incredible. Some things are just mean to be. It is unbelievable isn't it?"" commentator Darren Fletcher said on TNT Sports.
""You just have to look about. There are a lot of stunned people at the moment.""
Liverpool retired their number 20 shirt following Jota's death.
The Reds' record goalscorer Ian Rush, Palace chairman Steve Parish and Football Association (FA) chair Debbie Hewitt laid wreaths at the Liverpool end of Wembley before the match as fans sang a rousing rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.

Is it time to start giving 'disruptors' Chelsea some credit?,Chelsea's recent approach has been difficult to understand at times - but Nizaar Kinsella wonders whether it is time to start giving them some credit.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c07pn7m0513o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 08:44:37",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"To understand what's going on at Stamford Bridge, you need to forget everything you instinctively know about football.
No club at the top level has ever attempted to rebuild in the way that Chelsea are since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's takeover of the club in May 2022.
Unprecedented 10-year contracts, nearly £900m spent on players aged 21 or younger and a bending of certain Premier League profit and sustainability rules (PSR) has allowed a total of £1.6bn to be paid in transfers fees across a three-year period.
Chelsea's approach has confused and alienated some football fans - but qualifying for the Champions League, winning the Conference League and then claiming the Club World Cup has changed the conversation.
Enzo Maresca will also be the first manager to be entrusted with back-to-back campaigns in what will be the fourth season under this ownership, with a world champions badge to be emblazoned on Chelsea's shirt for the next four years.
Internally, Chelsea see their latest victories as vindication of a 'disruptor' approach led by the owners, delivered by the sporting directors and made to work on the pitch by Maresca.
However, the disruptors face disruption as their pre-season has been shortened to just two under weeks because of the Club World Cup.
Recruitment decisions are coming good
Cole Palmer is the poster boy for Chelsea, but other star players like Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez and Marc Cucurella are now delivering on high price tags.
Pedro Neto scored three goals in three consecutive games at the Club World Cup for the first time in his senior career, while new signings Joao Pedro and Liam Delap have been bright in their first matches for the club.
Players like Benoit Badiashile, Christopher Nkunku and, to a lesser extent, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, show that not every transfer has been a roaring success.
However, Chelsea have been good at selling players - as highlighted by the sale of unsuccessful £45m signing Joao Felix to Al-Nassr for £43.7m this summer.
Noni Madueke generated £52m, Djordje Petrovic was sold for £25m and Ishe Samuels-Smith left for £6.5m this summer.
Sales like these balance record-breaking purchases worth £1.6bn by this ownership. About £600m, not including potential sell-on clause revenue, has been made and recent club accounts show an English record of £152m banked for player sales from the 2023-24 season.
There remains a high net spend of about £1bn in three years, but Chelsea's owners say these stay on the balance sheet and represent an ""investment"".
The much-criticised approach of offering up to 10-year deals to players has also  given Chelsea increased bargaining power when selling players, renewing contracts or simply keeping their wage bill down in the longer term.
There is noise that Caicedo, arguably among the best midfielders in the world, is angling for improved terms on his contract signed in 2023 - but that still runs for a further six years and negotiations have yet to formally begin.
Manchester City striker Erling Haaland signed a nine-and-a-half-year contract  - and, as the old saying goes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Maresca winning over the fans
Chelsea's fans are known for being particularly impatient, perhaps as a result of enjoying such success in the Roman Abramovich era despite constant hiring and firing of coaches.
Couple that with Maresca's brusque tone when addressing fan criticism, as well as missing chances to engage with the match-going support last season, and he has faced calls to leave the club as recently as April.
However, a comeback win against Fulham was arguably the turning point which led to a triple success of earning Champions League football, winning the Conference League and then Club World Cup.
Maresca was never under pressure internally at Chelsea, who took a decision to judge him after his second season, but qualification for the Champions League is viewed as his most important success to date. Repeating that feat remains the main target for next season, along with demonstrating that he is generally making progress.
Yet, with the fans, Maresca has rapidly improved his standing, especially after winning the Club World Cup.
Legitimate criticism remains
Is a 12th, sixth and fourth-place finish enough return on a £1bn net investment on players?
Chelsea have spent £2bn on players in six years, nearly double teams such as Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City, albeit balanced by the best player sales record over that time period. That £2bn figure was inflated by this new ownership and, according to Chelsea's own accounts, their current squad cost £1.4bn, the highest such number ever in the Premier League.
Of course, the £87.5m in prize money won at the Club World Cup, plus the £80m-£100m on its way thanks to being in the Champions League, helps. But whether that is a good return divides opinion from within the game.
Chelsea are trying to achieve something that has never been done, effectively emulating Brighton's successful player-trading model, while also winning big trophies.
They had the youngest average starting XI ever recorded in a Premier League season last year, at 24 years and 36 days old.
By contrast, the youngest team to win the Premier League was Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in 2004-05 with an average age of 25 years, 250 days, while Liverpool's title winners last season averaged 27 years and 233 days old.
To highlight the difference, Chelsea did not use a player over the age of 27 last season and their oldest signing this summer is 23-year-old striker Joao Pedro.
Another criticism is of Chelsea's ""bomb squad"", featuring Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Renato Veiga, Lesley Ugochukwu, Axel Disasi and Armando Broja, all not involved in Maresca's pre-season plans and have been training in a separate group at Cobham Training Centre.
Ugochukwu and Broja have now signed for Burnley for a reported £40m combined.
Then there are alleged associated party transactions after the sale of the women's team (£200m) and two hotels (£76.6m) helped Chelsea avoid breaking the Premier League's PSR spending rules. Meanwhile, Uefa's stricter financial rules have also seen the club punished.
Chelsea have spent a record £75m on agents in 2023-24, too, with a league-high total of £178.6m across the past three seasons.
They were also the only club not to agree a front-of-shirt sponsor last season but are confident of finding a new, long-term partner this summer after tendering a contract for £65m-a-season to advertising insiders, while seeking a reputable partner now they are back in the Champions League.
The disruptors face disruption
Winning the Club World Cup final on 13 June has not been without its problems.
Maresca was good to his word by giving his players three weeks off but it meant they returned to the Cobham training ground on 4 August - just 13 days before their opening Premier League game against Crystal Palace.
Their only pre-season friendlies were against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan at Stamford Bridge - although club staff say they are confident of getting players fit in time, while those close to the squad appreciate a proper holiday being fitted in.
Chelsea handled the difficult weather, travel and long season exceedingly well in the United States at the Club World Cup, but dealing with an extremely short pre-season is another challenge to take on.
When asked by BBC Sport about the impact of the short pre-season, Maresca said: ""I don't have the answer, I am quite curious because this is the first time it happened. The focus was just to rest as they played 64 games and didn't stop for one year in a row which never happened before. The focus was recovery and rest.
""It's strange, it's different, Palace started when we were in USA, we had three weeks off, started two days ago with two friendlies in 48 hours, we will see game-by-game, day-by-day about how we are.""

Crystal Palace keen to sell captain Marc Guéhi before transfer window closes,Palace could lose player for nothing next year,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/11/crystal-palace-keen-to-sell-captain-marc-guehi-before-transfer-window-closes,"Mon, 11 Aug 2025 05:00:44",Ed Aarons,['Liverpool'],"The Crystal Palace chairman, Steve Parish, has admitted that they are looking to sell their captain Marc Guéhi in this transfer window to avoid potentially losing him for nothing next summer.
The England defender has entered the final 12 months of his contract at Selhurst Park and is wanted by a number of Premier League teams, including Liverpool and Newcastle. It is understood that Arne Slot’s side – who lost to Palace on penalties in the Community Shield on Sunday – is Guéhi’s preferred option, although they have so far been reluctant to pay Palace’s £40m valuation.
Newcastle failed with multiple bids in excess of £50m for the 24-year-old last summer, while Tottenham had an offer worth up to £70m rejected by Palace in January. But when asked if they would be willing to allow Guéhi to leave this month if they receive a suitable offer, Parish acknowledged that they could not afford to allow him to run down his contract.
“We’d have to do that, of course,” he said. “For players of that calibre to leave on a free, it’s a problem for us unfortunately. [Last summer] Joachim [Anderson] went [to Fulham] and we couldn’t afford to lose both. We then had another bid in January but that was a different situation. We’ll just have to see what happens. But, you know, it needs a new contract or a conclusion of some kind.”
Guéhi is understood to be willing to stay at Selhurst Park and see out his contract if necessary. He will be able to sign a pre-contract agreement with clubs outside England in January, while Eberechi Eze has also attracted interest from Arsenal in this transfer window. “As far as people being here or not being here, it depends,” added Parish. “If it’s the right decision for the football club and for them, nobody can make anyone go, then there’ll be some changes.”
Oliver Glasner has been critical of Palace’s lack of activity in the transfer market so far but Parish insisted that he will do his best to back the Austrian manager after delivering the club’s second piece of silverware in the space of three months. “I admire Oliver so much. He just wants to win trophies and football matches,” he said. “The Premier League is kind of crazy, the money that people spend and the kind of financial jeopardy that people take. So I have to look at everything around [that].
“We’ll do everything we can in the next few weeks to give ourselves the best chance. But at the end of the day, the amount of money we’ve got isn’t infinite.”
Parish also said he was hopeful that Palace’s appeal to the court of arbitration for sport against their demotion to the Europa Conference League will be successful. The hearing was held in Lausanne on Friday, with a decision expected on Monday afternoon. “It’ll be good to put it behind us,” he said.
“I’m determined that we get the right outcome – if we don’t, we’ll have to look at if there’s any steps after that. But after Friday, I don’t understand how we cannot be in the competition.”

Liverpool given reality check after summer transfers and tragedy | John Brewin,"Despite goals from two new signings, Liverpool’s Community Shield defeat asks fresh questions of Arne Slot",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/10/liverpool-crystal-palace-community-shield-summer-transfers-tragedy,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 18:48:35",John Brewin,['Liverpool'],"Wembley was supposed to be a case of the men who weren’t there. It ended up posing questions of the team asked to defend the Premier League title.
Alexander Isak may become a Liverpool player. That will be decided soon enough by the transfer market; a game of charades is being played before money eventually dictates its conclusion.
Modern football’s eternal melodramas fade into insignificance when considering the player Isak could replace as a Liverpool centre‑forward. The club plays under the shadow of the loss of Diogo Jota, his death alongside his brother André Silva on a Spanish highway– its shattering of family and friends – a reminder that football is played by real people with real lives. Liverpool’s pre‑match lineup did not feature a No 20, Jota’s number retired.
The season ahead will be played in memory of a popular, skilled yet understated professional – 12 months ago at Ipswich he was the scorer of the first Premier League goal of Arne Slot’s reign. Jota died a champion, a beloved teammate. Before kick-off, Wembley was supposed to observe a minute’s silence, only for an idiot fringe of Crystal Palace’s fans to shame themselves by chanting – a tiny number, though enough for a booed response from Liverpool fans with the referee, Chris Kavanagh, blowing his whistle quickly. What should have been a moment of perspective was sullied. Football’s ability to crack on blithely in the face of tragedy is one of its worst qualities.
The Palace contingent, 99% of whom had been observant, wanted to get their own message across. “Uefa mafia” declared a banner, highlighted by burning pyro. Palace’s summer of FA Cup celebration is still overshadowed by the legal wrangle over their European participation – the outcome of the club’s appeal due to be announced on Monday – while Uefa and the Nottingham Forest principal Evangelos Marinakis had their names taken in vain in a lengthy chorus of disdain.
The show rolled inexorably on, Wembley offering a snapshot of a new Liverpool. Whether Jota would have been part of the sporting director Richard Hughes’s plans to overhaul the squad Jürgen Klopp left last year for Slot is for the birds but it was Hugo Ekitiké, part of the overhaul, who scored first.
As a central striker, Ekitiké looked much like the real deal should Isak not arrive. A player denied a chance to shine at Paris Saint-Germain – who turned to galacticos – put his mark down, though rued a couple of misses. Florian Wirtz added grace and magic, all drops of the shoulder and acceleration, sometimes strolling, sometimes darting, carrying the haughty, aristocratic air of the very best German footballers.
Liverpool became champions last season by their consistency, patiently taking the steam from opponents. Pre-season and Wembley suggest a more open‑house approach, with attendant vulnerabilities. Amid the sound and fury of an occasion played at near full pelt by both teams, the problems of Liverpool turning the dial up to 11 on attack were soon apparent.
Jeremie Frimpong is not Trent Alexander‑Arnold as an attacking full-back, breaking behind the lines rather than passing beyond them. His goal was almost certainly inadvertent, but showed the dimensions he might add. That he scored on 20min 20sec, as Liverpool fans remembered Jota, showed perfect timing, too.
That Eberechi Eze, drifting inside left, had Frimpong’s defensive measure was just one problem. Liverpool’s other Dutch defender, Virgil van Dijk, was unusually clumsy in bringing down Ismaïla Sarr for a penalty, flat-footed on other occasions. The return of another Dutchman, Ryan Gravenberch, who was on paternity leave, or Alexis Mac Allister, short of fitness to start, may solve such issues but there was top-heaviness and imbalance. Opposing scouts will have noticed the lack of cover Mohamed Salah provided to Frimpong, as was often the case for Alexander-Arnold. The Egyptian king’s creative partnership with Wirtz needs working on, too. There was a fault on the line between them, Salah reduced to one effort on goal – sometimes enough but not here, and dragged into Dean Henderson’s hands. The less said about his shootout penalty the better.
If Milos Kerkez was ever keen to overlap, Sarr’s running showed he can be exposed defensively, and the out-of-position Hungarian was at fault as his tormentor scored Palace’s second equaliser. Perhaps a £150m forward is not the answer Slot is looking for. Marc Guéhi, a central defender Liverpool are linked with but may be beyond their spending limits should Isak actually arrive, showed typical cool as Palace assumed control in the second half. Adam Wharton, a midfielder the elite should covet, found his forwards with his passing range. Oliver Glasner has barely been able to add to his squad during the summer’s limbo but the Austrian’s golden touch continued as Palace edged a nerve-filled shootout to celebrate another trophy win.
For Liverpool, losing the Community Shield cannot come remotely close to the genuine, human loss of the friend and teammate without whom their squad must play on. Wembley suggested reclaiming the glory enjoyed when Jota was among them may not be as easy as a summer of transfer fantasy had made it seem.

Chelsea target Xavi Simons in possible Christopher Nkunku swap deal with RB Leipzig,Nkunku is for sale and could return to Bundesliga club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/10/chelsea-target-xavi-simons-in-possible-christopher-nkunku-swap-deal-with-rb-leipzig,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 12:33:13",Ed Aarons,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","Chelsea are in talks with RB Leipzig over a potential swap deal for Xavi Simons that could lead to Christopher Nkunku returning to the German club.
It is understood Leipzig would like to re-sign the France striker, who moved to Stamford Bridge on a six-year deal in 2023 for £52m but has failed to settle in west London, as a replacement for Benjamin Sesko after his £73.7m move to Manchester United. Chelsea have been in negotiations with the Bundesliga club over a fee for Xavi Simons, with the Netherlands forward having already agreed personal terms despite interest from Bayern Munich. Simons joined Leipzig from Paris Saint-Germain in January for €50m (£43m) after two successful loan spells and had been expected to cost about €70m (£61m) but Chelsea are now pushing to include Nkunku, who they believe to be valued at £40m, as part of the deal.
Negotiations are ongoing, with Chelsea likely to have to pay a sizeable fee on top for the 22-year-old, who can play in a number of attacking positions. Leipzig are also interested in signing Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott, who has interest from several Premier League clubs.
Chelsea remain in talks with United over a move for Alejandro Garnacho and are hoping to sell Nicolas Jackson to help balance the books. Newcastle have shown interest in the Senegal forward after missing out on Sesko and other targets, although they are believed to be waiting to see whether Liverpool make a new bid for Alexander Isak after turning down a £110m offer.
Jackson, who missed Chelsea’s 4-1 pre-season win over Milan on Sunday has fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge after the arrivals of Liam Delap and João Pedro, with Eddie Howe’s side believed to be frontrunners to sign the 24-year-old. He is understood to have trained alone on Friday after informing Chelsea that he would like to move, with Milan also linked with the 24-year-old.
Chelsea had valued Jackson at £80m but are likely to accept a reduced fee of around £65m as they attempt to reshape their attacking options. Nkunku and Jackson were both left out of Friday’s friendly against Bayer Leverkusen.

Crystal Palace sink Liverpool on penalties to claim Community Shield,,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/10/crystal-palace-liverpool-community-shield-match-report,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 16:30:26",Ed Aarons,['Liverpool'],"The rest of the Premier League take note: Liverpool may have spent almost £300m on new players this summer but that doesn’t make them unbeatable.
Goals from Hugo ­Ekitiké and ­Jeremie Frimpong and an ­impressive performance from Florian Wirtz had looked like being enough to seal a narrow victory against Crystal Palace in the Community Shield, as Arne Slot’s summer signings made an instant impact for the Premier League champions. But even with the possibility that they could still add Alexander Isak to the array of attacking talent already on the books, Oliver ­Glasner’s well‑drilled side showed that the Reds’ new‑look defence is fallible and ­Palace deserved to take this game to penalties after equalising for the second time in the afternoon, thanks to Ismaïla Sarr.
It was left to Justin Devenny, on as a substitute, to seal victory for the south London club after Mohamed Salah, Alexis Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott all missed in the shootout.
For the FA Cup winners, who contested this occasion for the first time in their history, it was another moment to savour as they await the outcome of their appeal to the court of arbitration for sport against their demotion from the Europa League, which is due to be announced on Monday.
However, after Frimpong and his fellow new signing Milos Kerkez struggled to contain Sarr and the outstanding ­Eberechi Eze at times, Liverpool may decide to step up their attempts to sign the Palace captain, Marc Guéhi, who left the field with cramp after another all-action display before returning to lift the trophy.
Only eight teams that have won the Community Shield in the ­Premier League era have gone on to win the title so Slot will not be losing too much sleep over this performance. But having conceded that his side go into the new campaign as favourites after their spending spree, he will be hoping they can be more clinical when they kick off against Bournemouth on Friday night.
It has been a summer of contrasts for these two clubs since they gave each other a guard of honour at Anfield in May. While Slot was able to name Ekitiké, Frimpong, Kerkez and Wirtz – whose fee could end up being a British‑record £116m – in his starting lineup, Glasner selected the same side that started against Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Plans for a repeat of the fantastic tifos that the ­supporters’ group, the ­Holmesdale Fanatics, produced for the wins against City and Aston Villa in the semi-final had to be shelved because of new strict Wembley regulations.
Liverpool’s fans behind one goal unveiled a banner in tribute to Diogo Jota before kick-off, with both teams observing a minute’s silence for the Portugal forward and his brother André Silva that was interrupted by a small section in the Palace end.
Slot had confirmed that Ryan Gravenberch was unavailable after his partner gave birth on Saturday night, with Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones anchoring midfield. It did not take long for his new boys to make an impression as Wirtz and Ekitiké exchanged a one-two on the left-hand side of the Palace penalty area in the fourth minute before the latter fired past Dean ­Henderson. Another clever touch from Ekitiké to play in Salah set up another golden chance for Cody Gakpo, only for the Palace goalkeeper and the assistant’s flag to deny Liverpool a second.
But Palace have shown they are a match for most these days and they responded immediately after Jean-Philippe Mateta found himself through on goal. He could not take the opportunity as Alisson spread himself but, a few seconds later, ­Virgil van Dijk was slow in spotting the danger from Sarr and the referee, Chris Kavanagh, had no option but to point to the penalty spot when the Dutchman mistimed his tackle. This time, Mateta made no mistake.
Having looked vulnerable against Eze in defence, like his predecessor Trent Alexander-Arnold, Frimpong is far more comfortable going forward. He was attempting to pick out ­Ekitiké at the back post when his cross looped over Henderson and in off the far post to restore Liverpool’s lead. Palace’s misfortune continued when Daichi Kamada was forced off with an injury on the half-hour, and his replacement Will Hughes failed to direct a volley on target just after coming on but otherwise added some bite to their midfield.
Ekitiké spurned a brilliant chance to extend Liverpool’s lead at the start of the second half when he headed a Kerkez cross wide with the goal ­gaping. The Hungary left-back, who was signed from Bournemouth for £40m, looked assured in attack and another excellent cross picked out Ekitiké, only for him to miss the target again.
Palace were growing in confidence as their fans repeatedly voiced opposition to Uefa. Chris Richards tested Alisson from a corner before Eze drew an excellent save from the Brazilian at his near post after being played in by Adam Wharton.
Liverpool seemed to have ­weathered the Palace storm but a lapse in concentration from Kerkez 13 minutes from time allowed ­Wharton to play in Sarr and his finish went in off the post. Had it not been for Kerkez’s late intervention, Sarr could have settled it moments later but the Liverpool defender was able to deflect his shot over the bar.
Salah finally had his first sight of goal with eight minutes to play yet the Egypt forward could only fire straight at Henderson, while Devenny was almost Palace’s hero in the last ­minute before he kept his cool from the spot to send their fans wild after Borna Sosa had missed his chance to seal the shootout.

Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk ‘disappointed’ after Diogo Jota tribute tarnished,Minority of fans in Crystal Palace end disrupt silence,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/10/minutes-silence-for-diogo-jota-cut-short-at-wembley-before-community-shield-liverpool-crystal-palace,"Sun, 10 Aug 2025 21:07:22",Ed Aarons,['Liverpool'],"The Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk was left disappointed after a minute’s silence in honour of Diogo Jota had to be cut short by the referee before kick-off in the Community Shield at Wembley.
Jota and his brother André Silva died in a car crash in Spain on 3 July and both were honoured before kick-off with wreaths laid on the pitch and a period of silence. The moment was interrupted by a minority of supporters from the Palace end, eliciting a strong response at the other end of the pitch, as well as from other Eagles fans, who tried to silence those not respecting the tribute.
“Yes, I am disappointed,” Van Dijk said. “That is the only thing I can say. I don’t know who did that but there was plenty trying to shush it down, but obviously that doesn’t help it. But it is what it is. You can’t control how many fans were here today? Was it 80,000 people? So, yeah, it is disappointing to hear that, but if that person or those persons can go home and be happy with themselves, then …”
Liverpool fans earlier paid respects with a rousing rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone as the wreaths were brought out, raising a white banner reading “Diogo J” and featuring the forward’s image and number 20.
The Liverpool great Ian Rush, the Palace chairman, Steve Parish, and the Football Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, laid the wreaths at the Liverpool end, as fans from both clubs expressed their respect with a standing ovation as the late siblings’ images were displayed on the big screens inside the stadium.
On the disruption, the Liverpool head coach Arne Slot responded diplomatically. “I am a positive person and if I look at the respect that has been paid to them both,” he said. “I don’t think he had a bad intention, the guy or guys. The fans of Crystal Palace and everywhere around the world have paid huge respect to Diogo and Andre.”
