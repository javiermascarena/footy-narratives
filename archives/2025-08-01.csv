Spurs in advanced talks to sign Palhinha on loan,"Tottenham are in advanced talks with Bayern Munich over the loan signing of Joao Palhinha, according to <em>Sky in Germany</em>.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13401076/joao-palhinha-transfer-news-tottenham-in-advanced-talks-to-sign-bayern-munich-midfielder-on-loan,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:00:00",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham are in advanced talks with Bayern Munich over the loan signing of Joao Palhinha, according to Sky in Germany.
Sky in Germany are also reporting that Spurs have negotiated an option to buy in the deal.
Palhinha could now be set for a return to the Premier League, one year after he joined Bayern from Fulham for a fee worth up to £47.4m.
The 30-year-old midfielder has three years remaining on his current contract.
Palhinha made 25 appearances across all competitions for Bayern last season, including 17 outings in the Bundesliga as Vincent Kompany's side went on to become champions.
Sky Sports' Peter Smith:
""Joao Palhinha left the Premier League last summer as the toughest tackler in the top flight. His total of 152 tackles was more than any other player by a distance and was the standout trait of the Fulham enforcer. There were 13 yellows in that 2023/24 season, too, underlining the bite he brings to midfield battles. And that would be a welcome addition to Spurs' play.
""Neither Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr nor Rodrigo Bentancur are as ruthless at winning the ball back as Palhinha, who also ranked among the top 10 for interceptions during his previous Premier League campaign.
""Palhinha's belated move to Bayern Munich didn't prove to be worth the wait, with an injury disruptive and head coach Vincent Kompany ultimately leaving him on the fringes. But a return to London looks like a smart switch for the Portuguese and Spurs - and a daunting one for opposition midfielders.""
Tottenham boss Thomas Frank admitted the club are ""looking"" for further additions in the summer transfer window.
Spurs have already secured the signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, as well as Kota Takai and Luka Vuskovic.
Kevin Danso and Mathys Tel have also seen their initial loan moves converted into permanent deals.
However, Frank's side missed out on Morgan Gibbs-White after the England international signed a new three-year deal at the City Ground.
Forest accused Spurs of making an illegal approach for the midfielder with a £60m bid earlier this month.
Speaking in his first press conference since being appointed to the role, Frank commented on further incomings, saying: ""There is no doubt that, if you want to compete in all tournaments, you need a competitive squad.
""There are a lot of competitive players in the squad already. The club is in the market and looking.
""What will happen, I will speak when a player comes into the building.""

Arsenal have their striker but creating chances the real issue,"Arsenal will be hoping Viktor Gyokeres can fire them to the Premier League title, but is creating chances an issue for the Gunners?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c207je99ndno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 01 Aug 2025 05:12:40",Chris Collinson,['Arsenal'],"It seemed last season like Arsenal were crying out for a goalscoring striker and they will feel they have got just that in the signing of Viktor Gyokeres.
While the Gunners conceded fewer goals than Liverpool in 2024-25, Arne Slot's side scored 17 more - arguably the key difference in the Premier League title race.
That is a problem Gyokeres has obviously been brought in to address, although it may be a bit more complicated than that.
When we look at the reasons why Arsenal scored just 69 goals to the champions' 86, it's clear that their problem wasn't finishing chances but creating them…
Arsenal won seven fewer penalties
Liverpool (13.3%) had a better shot conversion rate than Arsenal (12.6%) last season, but that's a misleading stat for one key reason - penalties.
Liverpool won and scored a league-high nine penalties, while Arsenal won and scored a paltry two.
Given that penalties were scored at a rate of 83% and non-penalty shots at just 11% in the Premier League in 2024-25, every spot-kick that a team won significantly distorted their shot conversion rate as a reflection of their finishing ability.
When we look at how ruthless the two teams were away from the penalty spot, it's actually Arsenal who were the (slightly) better finishers…
While Liverpool winning nine penalties was a lot, 14 teams have been awarded more in a season over the past decade - including Manchester United being awarded a whopping 14 penalties in 38 games in 2019-20.
However, for a team that finished as high in the table as Arsenal to win just two penalties is unusual. In the past 10 campaigns, a side ending up with a points tally in the 70s has won an average of five penalties, while champions have won an average of eight.
In fact, the last team to win so many points and so few penalties was Arsenal themselves back in 2015-16 when they also finished runners-up, winning just two penalties. Champions Leicester were awarded 13.
Those seven extra penalties last season had a significant impact on the title race, too, as Liverpool's nine spot-kicks won them an extra 11 points over the course of the campaign.
Since Arsenal's two penalties both came in a 5-2 win at West Ham in November, they earned the Gunners no points whatsoever.
Arsenal took far fewer shots
Putting penalties aside, we come to the major reason why Arsenal scored so few goals compared to Liverpool - they just didn't create enough chances!
Over the course of 38 games, Liverpool took 95 more non-penalty shots than the Gunners… exactly 2.5 more every game.
If Mikel Arteta's side had taken the same number of non-penalty shots as the champions and continued scoring at the rate that they did (12.3%) then they would've scored an additional 12 goals, showing Arsenal's main problem last season was that you can't score the chances you don't make.
Arsenal took worse-quality shots
Liverpool didn't just create more shots than Arsenal last season but better ones, too, as only Brentford created higher-quality chances on average in terms of expected goals per shot (excluding penalties).
What that means is Liverpool created chances last season that have historically been scored in the Premier League 12% of the time, while Arsenal's have been converted at a rate of 11%.
Now, a 1% difference might not sound like much but, given that Arsenal took 544 non-penalty shots over the course of last season, if they had created chances as good as the champions they would have scored an additional five goals (1% of 544).
So... Arsenal were actually pretty ruthless?
Eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that the goals Arsenal 'didn't score' thanks to the reasons above add up to 24, while in reality they scored 17 goals fewer than Liverpool.
That's because when you take shot quality into account, Arsenal weren't just slightly better finishers than the champions last season but much better finishers, as they overperformed their non-penalty xG by seven goals to Liverpool's measly 0.5.
In fact, despite the narrative around Arsenal's finishing last season, only Nottingham Forest and Wolves were more ruthless in front of goal than the Gunners.
The problem for Arteta's side was that Liverpool created so many more, and higher-quality, chances that they didn't need to be clinical to win the league.
So, in a nutshell, here are the reasons why Arsenal scored 17 goals fewer than Liverpool last season…
Now the good news: Gyokeres brings more than just finishing
While obviously the more Gyokeres can help Arsenal finish their chances the better, he should also help solve the Gunners' main problem of creating enough chances in the first place.
Last season he attempted 4.5 shots per 90 minutes on average in the Primeira Liga, far more than Gabriel Jesus (3.0) and Kai Havertz (2.6) averaged for Arsenal in the Premier League.
Although clearly the number of shots a striker takes is in part down to the service he gets from his team-mates, it's also a result of the options he gives his team-mates with his movement and anticipation in and around the box.
Given that Gyokeres also ranked second for chances created from open play in the league (60) and won the most penalties (4), he should play a major role in providing the ammunition the Gunners need to make a challenge for the Premier League title this season.

Tottenham close to loan move for Bayern's Palhinha,Tottenham close in on the loan signing of midfielder Joao Palhinha from Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjw6lplx5jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Fri, 01 Aug 2025 07:46:34",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham are closing in on a loan move for Bayern Munich midfielder Joao Palhinha.
Talks between the clubs are at an advanced stage, with an agreement in principle in place.
An agreement over personal terms is unlikely to pose a problem and the deal is set to carry an option for the 30-year-old to make the transfer permanent.
Palhinha has significant Premier League experience, making 68 top-flight appearances in two years at Fulham before his move to Germany for £42.3m in July 2024.
However, the Portugal international has made just six Bundesliga starts since his move to Bavaria and is keen for a return to England.
Spurs have already made Mathys Tel's loan move from Bayern permanent since the arrival of head coach Thomas Frank, while Mohammed Kudus has been signed from West Ham in a deal worth £55m.
They had previously looked to add to their midfield but failed in their pursuit of Nottingham Forest captain Morgan Gibbs-White.

""As soon as I heard Rangers were interested and wanted me to come, it was a massive opportunity for me,"" the teenager told Rangers' media.
""I think with the new boss and the way that we play, it's a great place to be at the minute. It was a pretty easy decision for me to come here.""

Ineos carer worked at Manchester United before ‘anti-doping questions’,David Rozman spent a month at Old Trafford last year,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/ineos-carer-worked-at-manchester-united-before-anti-doping-questions,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:18:56",Jeremy Whittle,['Manchester United'],"The Ineos Grenadiers head carer who left the Tour de France earlier this month after it was revealed he had been called to interview by the International Testing Agency (ITA) over alleged links to convicted German doping doctor, Mark Schmidt, worked for Manchester United in 2024.
Sources at Manchester United have confirmed to the Guardian that David Rozman spent one month working at Old Trafford last year as part of what is called a “knowledge exchange” within Ineos Sport. Rozman is described on the Ineos Grenadiers website as “one of the longest-serving members of our staff” who “takes on the important role of head carer”.
The Slovenian spent four weeks last year working alongside United’s soft tissue therapists as part of an exchange programme introduced after Sir Jim Ratcliffe became co-owner at Manchester United.
In a statement issued to the Guardian on 24 July, Ineos said Rozman had spoken “informally” to the ITA in April when he was told he was not under investigation but added: “Following recent media allegations, David Rozman has now received a request from the ITA to attend an interview. Accordingly, he has stepped back from race duties and has left the Tour.”
The allegations stem from a recent documentary made by ARD in Germany, which made claims linking Rozman to Schmidt but did not name him, with further media reports including alleged texts between the Ineos staff member and Schmidt from June 2012, when the team were racing as Team Sky.
The documentary and subsequent reports were said to have drawn on court transcripts and in-court reporting during the Aderlass hearings, which resulted in Schmidt being jailed in 2021 for orchestrating a doping ring revolving around cross-country skiers and multiple cyclists between 2012 and 2019.
Dave Brailsford, the head of Ineos Sport, who returned to the Tour de France this July after his sojourn at Manchester United, declined to comment on the Rozman allegations during the race. Brailsford was a leading figure in directing performance at Old Trafford.
Also seconded to Carrington, United’s training ground, during refurbishment of their laundry facilities, was an Ineos Grenadiers team bus for use by kit staff at Old Trafford.
British Cycling has confirmed that Rozman was also present, working for Team GB, at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympic Games.
His spell at Manchester United pre-dates the ARD documentary or any contact with the ITA.
In the statement on 24 July Ineos Grenadiers said: “The team has acted responsibly and with due process, taking the allegations seriously whilst acknowledging that David is a long-standing, dedicated member of the team. The team continues to assess the circumstances and any relevant developments, and has formally requested any relevant information from the ITA.
“To date the team has received no evidence from any relevant authority. In response to the team’s request for information, the ITA has advised the team that it cannot share any further information, due to legal and confidentiality restrictions. Both David and the team will of course co-operate with the ITA and any other authority. The team reiterates its zero-tolerance policy and is unable to comment further at this time.”
Ineos Grenadiers did not respond to further requests for comment.

Tom Brady’s Birmingham primed to touch down in the Championship,"Driven by the ambitious ownership of Tom Wagner and an NFL icon, the Blues intend to take the second tier by storm",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/tom-brady-birmingham-primed-touch-down-championship,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 19:00:02",Ben Fisher,['Chelsea'],"Unsurprisingly, Tom Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl champion and global sporting icon, is braced for the challenges that await Birmingham City, where he is a minority owner. “Just because you were successful last year doesn’t mean you’re going to be successful this year,” he says, alluding to a season that culminated in promotion and a record-breaking tally of 111 points. “You have to put the same amount of work, commitment and discipline in – sometimes more – because the stakes only get higher. When the competition gets tougher, the margin of error gets smaller.”
It is his final answer in an interview that takes in everything from the “blue-collar nature of Birmingham”, which he compares with Cleveland and Cincinnati, to the Championship landscape and the bubbling rivalry with Aston Villa, which he was educated on during his first visit to England’s second-biggest city after acquiring his 3.3% stake.
It is a moment detailed in the opening scene of Built in Birmingham: Brady & the Blues, the Prime Video documentary series released on Friday, as he travels past a giant mural depicting Jude Bellingham and Trevor Francis. “What’s the other team here?” he asks. “Fuck them … gonna fuck them up too,” he says, smiling.
Brady and Tom Wagner, the Birmingham chairman, are in bullish moods for our interview. Wagner’s mantra is “if you can’t say it, you can’t do it” and he is adamant Birmingham will return to the Premier League. But when? “The sooner the better,” he replies.
“I think it would be great for the city of Birmingham to have an inner-city derby that brings fans together in a non-violent way; we don’t want it to be peaceful, we don’t want it to be violent either, but we want to allow them the joy of experiencing that great rivalry again. I love reading the comments from Villa supporters, but I think it’s beyond that. There’s so many other great clubs we would love to compete against.”
The series contains colourful characters, differing generations of supporters. “We’ve had so many rebirths,” says one, Paul Collins, “but they’ve all been phantom pregnancies.”
There is a potted history taking in Barry Fry urinating in all four corners of St Andrew’s to lift a curse and other amusing moments. “I fell in love with fixing businesses,” says Wagner, the co-founder of Knighthead Capital, the multibillion investment fund that acquired a controlling stake two years ago.
On their arrival at Birmingham, one-third of the ground had been condemned, there was no hot water in the men’s toilets and no heating in the executive offices. “We’re not even close to being done, and now we’re embarking on an even more ambitious feat,” Wagner says of plans to build a sports quarter on a 60-acre site with a 62,000-seat stadium, more than double the current capacity. “We want to compete at the top level of the Championship [this season].”
After their final home game last season, Wagner enjoyed a mic-drop moment, telling those present: “The best part of the story is just beginning. I promise you this is not the best day we will enjoy together.”
Perhaps the most surreal moment of the series is Sir David Beckham, among the VIP guests for Birmingham’s home win over Wrexham last September, explaining to Brady the insulting chants Birmingham fans are directing at their Welsh counterparts. What else did Beckham teach him that night?
Brady laughs. “A few things that were being said … some of it I couldn’t really fully understand because there’s some thick accents that I’m not 100% educated on yet, but David’s helped me out.” Another time we see Brady mastering his pronunciation of Birmingham en route to the training ground. “I learned that pretty early on. When I first did my social media video [announcing my involvement], they said: ‘It’s Birmingham, not Birming-ham.’”
Wrexham, also promoted last season, have become friendly foes. Wagner says other teams “want in” on Birmingham’s brewing competition with the Welsh club, owned by the Hollywood pair Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds.
“Rivalries are very important because they allow you to focus at a different level: your concentration, effort, it all becomes very maximised when you’re playing against these rivals,” Brady says. “The fundamentals of the sport [football], the tactics, are different to American football. It’s a different sport but the values are very much the same.”
After that win over Wrexham, there is a snapshot into the bigger picture, a reminder that this is business after Wagner congratulates manager, Chris Davies, and his staff. “I’m going to go back upstairs, we’ve got 1,000 people we’re trying to get to spend money in the club so that you guys can spend more next summer,” says Wagner, a former certified public accountant on Wall Street.
One of his primary aims is building revenues to close the gap to clubs awarded parachute payments. Asked whether the numbers are where he expected this summer, Wagner says they have smashed this season’s original target. “My team loves it when they achieve a goal and I say: ‘Well, now it’s 10% higher’,” he says. Commercial deals with Nike and Delta Air Lines help.
“We’ve achieved levels of revenue that no one has ever done in the Championship, save for clubs receiving parachute payments,” Wagner says. “So, if we were to fast-forward a year – if we were fortunate enough to get promoted – our first year in the Premier League, I think we’ll fall mid-table in total revenues, which is unheard of for a club just entering into the Prem. That’s the way we think about the club and that’s what our objectives are aimed towards – not just getting to the Prem, but then being there for good, and then ultimately becoming competitive.”
Birmingham are looking forward but the appointment of Wayne Rooney backfired. The first episode touches on Rooney’s tenure: two wins in 15 matches and 83 days in charge, a run that paved the way to relegation. Wagner says now he “wouldn’t trade that history for the world, because the lessons were invaluable”. We see an awkward, small talk exchange between Brady and Rooney and, later, with Brady stewing in the car after leaving the training ground, comes a telling remark. “I’m a little bit worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” Brady says.
Rooney was sacked in January 2024 and Brady is reluctant to linger on the past: “I have very high expectations for myself and certainly for a club and people I associate with, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Wayne. He’s one of the greatest players to step on to a football pitch. And that was a couple of years ago, at this point Chris is our manager … I love Chris’s work ethic, attitude, determination and humility.”
On deadline day last summer, Birmingham made a splash after signing Jay Stansfield for a record-breaking £15m fee from Fulham. Episode three focuses on the England Under-21 striker’s return to Exeter City, for whom his late father, Adam, also played. We hear from Taylor, one of Stansfield’s younger brothers, who joined Birmingham as kit man during Stansfield’s loan at the club, and their mother, Marie. “As a footballer, he is just like his dad … he even runs like his dad,” she says. “They both run with their pinky finger out,” Taylor says, smiling. Marie is in the stand opposite the one renamed after Adam, which Stansfield blows a kiss towards after scoring a penalty.
Birmingham have been aggressive in the market this summer, too, with the returning Demarai Gray and the former Celtic striker Kyogo Furuhashi two of eight signings. More new faces are expected to follow. So, how does Wagner reflect on his time as chair? “I think the biggest metric for us is the increased amount of interest that we have in the club from new and existing supporters, where we’re now enjoying record levels of season-ticket sales,” he says of the 20,000 signed up this season and referencing the 15,000-strong season-ticket waiting list, a first for the club.
It is apt that Birmingham host Ipswich, the last team to win back-to-back promotions to the Premier League, in the Championship curtain-raiser a week on Friday.
The final episode takes in one of few hiccups under Knighthead: defeat in the Vertu Trophy final at Wembley in April. “I don’t like losing,” says Wagner. “I’ll back that up,” says Brady. “We sold 50,000 tickets and when the last ticket sold, there were 23,000 people on the phone waiting to purchase tickets,” Wagner adds.
“Whatever we’re doing seems to be resonating with people, in that they want to be a part of the journey. We knew it was a big club with a lot of supporters but I don’t think we appreciated how many live and die with us on match day.”

Everton’s £27m bid for Tyler Dibling turned down by Southampton,David Moyes frustrated again in the transfer market,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/evertons-27m-bid-for-tyler-dibling-turned-down-by-southampton,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:03:02",Andy Hunter,['Chelsea'],"Southampton have rejected a £27m bid from Everton for Tyler Dibling, leaving the Merseyside club to consider an improved offer to land the England Under-21 international.
The 19-year-old was one of the few pluses in a troubled season for the relegated club and has attracted interest from Aston Villa, Fulham and West Ham. He has two years remaining on his contract at St Mary’s Stadium and is believed to be open to a move to Merseyside.
Everton have endured a frustrating summer in the transfer market, particularly in their attempts to improve their options out wide. David Moyes has missed out on Francisco Conceição, who joined Juventus from Porto, and RB Leipzig’s recent signing from PSV Eindhoven, Johan Bakayoko. Another target, Lyon’s Malick Fofana, would prefer to join a club offering Champions League football.
Moyes has struggled to fill his bench with established players during Everton’s pre-season tour of the United States, where his team have lost to West Ham and Bournemouth. The club have made four signings so far this summer but have lost nine members of last season’s first-team squad. Everton are expected to increase their offer for Dibling.

Tottenham in talks to sign João Palhinha on loan from Bayern,Thomas Frank wants more options in midfield,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/tottenham-in-talks-to-sign-joao-palhinha-on-loan-from-bayern,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:56:59",Ed Aarons,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham are hopeful of signing João Palhinha on loan after opening talks with Bayern Munich over the Portugal midfielder. Palhinha, who joined Bayern from Fulham last summer in a deal worth up to £47.4m, is understood to be keen to return to the Premier League having rarely featured under Vincent Kompany.
He is wanted by the new Spurs manager, Thomas Frank, to provide extra options in central midfield, with talks over a deal for the 30-year-old continuing. It appears likely Bayern will sanction Palhinha’s departure, although it remains to be seen whether any deal would include an option or obligation to make the deal permanent.
Tottenham beat Arsenal 1-0 in a pre-season friendly at Hong Kong’s Kai Tak Stadium on Thursday in the first north London derby to be played overseas thanks to a long-range strike from Pape Matar Sarr.
Signing Palhinha would undoubtedly provide much-needed experience in central midfield given he made almost 80 appearances in the Premier League during his two seasons at Fulham after joining from Sporting.
Spurs have signed Mathys Tel from Bayern this summer for around £30m after the Frenchman spent the second half of last season on loan in north London. They have also added Mohammed Kudus from West Ham, but failed in their pursuit of Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White.

Slot says Liverpool will target quality players amid links to Alexander Isak,Newcastle forward is training at former club Sociedad,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/liverpool-arne-slot-newcastle-alexander-isak,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 13:52:19",Guardian sport,['Liverpool'],"With Liverpool being heavily linked to a move for Alexander Isak, Arne Slot said the club would never hesitate to sign a quality player if the chance presents itself. The Premier League champions have already spent close to £300m this summer and are expected to bid for the Sweden striker.
Liverpool are longstanding admirers of Isak and have funds available from the £65.5m sale of Luis Díaz to Bayern Munich. Isak is known to be keen on moving to Anfield and it was confirmed by Real Sociedad on Thursday that he is “working with his trainers” at the club’s Zubieta base after missing Newcastle’s tour of Asia.
The 25-year-old has three years left on his contract and Newcastle would want £150m for their prized asset. Liverpool, it is believed, do not want to pay more than £120m. They will almost certainly have to break the British transfer record to get their man.
“I always say, another thing about Liverpool is that if we see a chance in the market we never hesitate to bring someone in,” said Slot as Liverpool left Japan after their pre-season tour of the far east. “It’s about quality and we have already made some very good signings.”
This summer Liverpool have brought in Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen, the former for a club-record £100m, as well as Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth, Hugo Ekitiké from Eintracht Frankfurt and the goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili from Valencia.
“It’s the way this club has worked over several years: targeting a specific player who we think can strengthen the squad and can bring us quality,” said Slot. “Then we try to bring him in. “We do spend, but if we spend, then we always need to recoup some money.”
Díaz’s move to Germany means Liverpool have raised more than £190m from player sales since Richard Hughes became sporting director in June 2024.

John Rooney’s surname is unlikely to go unnoticed, yet the younger brother of the England and Manchester United legend Wayne is, by his own admission, a far less glitzy appointment than his predecessor Savage, whose effervescent character came to define Macclesfield in recent years.
A self-styled Marmite man, Savage enjoyed unparalleled success in his season-long stint at Macclesfield, winning the Northern Premier League with a mammoth 109 points. His departure to Forest Green earlier this summer left a void, with key players such as Laurent Mendy, Tre Pemberton and Neil Kengni following him to Gloucestershire.
Pictures of Savage still adorn the walls behind Rooney as we chat in the boardroom of the Leasing.com Stadium, days out from Macclesfield’s opening game of the new National League North campaign against Worksop Town. “I’ll be different to Sav,” says Rooney, an attacking midfielder who rejoined Macclesfield as a player in August 2023 following stints at clubs such as New York Red Bulls, Orlando City, Barrow and Oldham before announcing his retirement at the end of last season. “He has always been out there as a player and a pundit. He likes attention – not in a bad sense. I’ll go under the radar and be my own person. I’d be stupid to act like Sav, because I’m a different person and I’d be being false.”
There’s no doubt Savage’s exit has been seismic, but it took just days for Macclesfield to replace him with Rooney. Plans had already been in place for the 34-year-old to take up a coaching role if a vacancy arose. “It happened so quick with Sav going, so we didn’t have time to sit back and think about it,” Rooney says. “Rob [Smethurst, the club’s owner] told me on the Monday and we were training on the Tuesday.”
Rooney had little hesitation accepting the role and there was even a word of advice from his brother, whose own tumultuous managerial journey in the past few years may provide a lesson for John. “When I got the job, [Wayne] said: ‘Just try and enjoy it’. Obviously he went into management and did well at some places, not so well at other places. And listen, that’s football. It’s part of management. you’re not going to get your own way all the time.”
“When do these opportunities come up to be a manager of a club like this? Not often,” Rooney adds. “It might not come again. So once I got wind of it, I wanted to take it with both hands. You could be falling out of the game as a player, then you’re scratching around to come back in as a coach. I spoke about it last year with Sav, that if he ever left, would I be interested? I always said I’d want to throw myself right at it.”
Rooney, whose playing days began in the Everton academy like his brother, made his professional debut with Macclesfield in 2008. He’s now a novice manager but with experience by his side to call upon. Macclesfield have just appointed Francis Jeffers, another ex-Everton player, as Rooney’s assistant. “I’ve known Franny for a long time. I played under him as a coach at Oldham. He’s coached at Ipswich, out in Saudi. I wanted someone older than me who would challenge me, not just agree with everything I say. I’d be naive otherwise.” Rooney laughs off the idea of offering a job to a certain other former Everton striker. He’s keen to be his own man.
It’s put to Rooney that he is still registered as a player for the coming season, so could mirror the player-manager role in which Wayne thrived at Derby early in his own managerial career. “Touch wood I’m not needed,” he replies. “It’s been a pretty smooth transition to managing. It’s now my third spell here; two as a player and now as manager. Everyone knows what this club means to me. I started here, they gave me my chance in professional football and I’ll never forget that.”
Rooney takes the reins at an intriguing stage in the Silkmen’s journey. They have blazed a trail through the divisions, with three promotions in four years, and now face their most challenging task in the National League North. “It’s going to be a lot tougher than last year,” admits Rooney, with a nod to the fellow phoenix clubs Hereford, Chester and Darlington who are on this season’s fixture list. “Come December, January, away from home, the pitches won’t be great, it’s about being adaptable.
“Last year we got on that winning streak and winning is a habit. We need to roll that on to this season. There are some big teams in this league, five or six clubs that are full time and that’s our goal as well, we want to get to the full-time stage.”
Will Macclesfield hit a glass ceiling at some point soon? Rooney will not countenance the idea. “We want to finish as high as possible. Our plan is to carry on.”

Højlund vows to ‘fight for place’ but Amorim admits striker could leave Manchester United,Dane scored in 4-1 win over Bournemouth,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/amorim-offers-rasmus-hojlund-no-guarantees-over-manchester-united-future,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 12:01:52",Guardian sport,['Manchester United'],"Rasmus Højlund insists he wants to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford, despite Manchester United’s eagerness to sign a new striker. Ruben Amorim was unable to offer the Danish international any guarantees over his future after Højlund scored in a 4-1 pre-season win over Bournemouth on Wednesday.
United are interested acquiring either Benjamin Sesko or Ollie Watkins after a difficult season in front of goal when they scored 44 goals in 38 games on the way to a disappointing 15th-placed finish. Højlund has struggled since his £72m move from Atalanta two years ago, scoring 14 times in 62 league appearances but got the opener in Chicago. Patrick Dorgu, Amad Diallo and Ethan Williams increased the lead while Bournemouth’s consolation came courtesy of a Matthijs de Light own goal.
“The most important [thing] for me is to keep working hard and stay focused and then we’ll see what happens,” Højlund said. “My plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot.”
United have been linked with a number of strikers, missing out on Liam Delap and Hugo Ekitike, with Sesko and Watkins topping the current shortlist. “Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me,” Højlund said. “I’m more than ready.”
Højlund has worked hard at United, but that has not been rewarded with goals, nor has he received consistent service. “I’m really happy with Rasmus, but I don’t know what is going to happen until the end of the market,” Amorim said.
“The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He’s connecting really well with the team. He’s improving. I don’t know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a lot because of the lack of goals last season.”
Matheus Cunha did not play due to fatigue while fellow new signing Bryan Mbeumo is scheduled to make his first appearance against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. Harry Maguire was replaced by De Ligt at half-time as United continue to treat the centre-back with caution.
“He had an issue during the holidays, during training,” Amorim said. “He’s a little bit late [in his training schedule] so we have to be careful with him. It’s just a little bit fatigue with the training so we are trying to control everything and saving all the players, to give the exact minutes they need.”
  Left-back Dorgu, who joined for £25m from Lecce in February, provided the assist for Højlund before getting on the scoresheet himself and he was another player who caught Amorim’s eye. “He looks more and more like he belongs in Manchester United and that is hard to do it at 20 years old so I’m really impressed with Patrick,” said the United boss, who was equally happy with Williams’s goal. “I celebrate that goal. It’s not usual, even during the season, but I celebrate that goal because I really like to see the kids that work really well.”
  Amorim believes the work done in pre-season, something he was not able to do having arrived in November, is paying dividends. “I’m really happy with the players that we had last season. They are improving. We look like a different team today. Let’s continue with that.
“But again, it’s a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season. It’s important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game.”

West Ham’s Lucas Paquetá cleared of spot-fixing charges brought by FA,West Ham star expresses relief at ‘not proven’ findings,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/west-hams-lucas-paqueta-cleared-of-spot-fixing-charges-brought-by-fa,"Thu, 31 Jul 2025 14:17:48",Matt Hughes,['Manchester City'],"Lucas Paquetá has been cleared of spot-fixing following a two-year investigation by the Football Association. The West Ham midfielder was charged with four counts of being deliberately booked to influence betting markets on Premier League games in May 2024, but the independent regulatory commission that heard the case has found the charges to be not proven.
Paquetá – who had faced a life ban – has asserted his innocence since being made aware the FA had been alerted to suspicious betting patterns around bookings he received in four Premier League games while playing for West Ham in 2022 and 2023, an investigation that led to the collapse of a proposed £85m move to Manchester City in August 2023. The 27-year-old has continued to play for West Ham and Brazil, who have supported him throughout the process.
“Since the first day of this investigation I have maintained my innocence against these extremely serious accusations,” Paquetá said. “I can’t say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my face. To my wife who never let go of my hand, to West Ham United, to the fans who always cheered me on, and to my family, friends and the legal team who have supported me – thank you for everything.”
West Ham’s vice-chair, Karren Brady, said: “We are pleased Lucas has been cleared. He has maintained his innocence from the outset, and as a club we have resolutely stood by him and supported him throughout the process. Despite the incredible pressure on him, Lucas has performed week in and week out for the Club, always giving everything.”” It has been a difficult time for Lucas and his family, but he has remained absolutely professional throughout and he is now looking forward to drawing a line under this episode, as is everyone at West Ham United.”
In a statement, the FA confirmed that the alleged breaches of FA Rule E5 were found to be not proven. Two lesser charges of failing to cooperate with the FA investigation were upheld, however. While the independent commission has yet to determine a sanction, Paquetá is likely to be fined.
In a charge sheet issued to Paquetá last year, the FA had recommended a life ban from football if found guilty. The governing body alleged: “Lucas Paquetá directly sought to influence the progress, conduct, or any other aspect of, or occurrence in these matches by intentionally seeking to receive a card from the referee for the improper purpose of affecting the betting market, in order for one or more persons to profit from betting.”
The matches in question were West Ham’s Premier League fixtures against Leicester on 12 November 2022, Aston Villa on 12 March 2023, Leeds on 21 May 2023 and Bournemouth on 12 August 2023.
Paquetá’s lawyer, Alastair Campbell of Level, issued a statement praising the player’s resilience for continuing to play with a potential life ban hanging over him. “Few cases carry the gravity of this one – professionally, personally and emotionally for our client,” Campbell said. “Lucas has faced down immense pressure with remarkable strength and resilience. Now, he can finally get back to focusing on the things that matter most to him – playing football and being with his family.”
The FA will not comment further until it has received the written reasons for the commission’s verdict, which are expected to be published in a few weeks.
