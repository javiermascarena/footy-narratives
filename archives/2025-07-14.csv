Palmer left bemused as Trump joins Chelsea celebrations after Club World Cup win,Cole Palmer was left shocked and stunned as United States President Donald Trump joined Chelsea on stage as they celebrated their Club World Cup success on Sunday.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396374/club-world-cup-cole-palmer-bemused-as-donald-trump-joins-chelsea-celebrations-after-victory-over-psg,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 08:00:00",,['Chelsea'],"Cole Palmer was left shocked and stunned as United States President Donald Trump joined Chelsea on stage as they celebrated their Club World Cup success on Sunday.
In a moment that has gone viral on social media, a bemused Palmer appeared to question why Trump, who presented Chelsea with the trophy alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino, remained in position on the stage as Reece James lifted the trophy and the team began their celebrations amid fireworks and confetti.
Palmer, who scored twice and set up another as the Blues stunned favourites Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in front of Trump in the final in New Jersey, said afterwards: ""I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy. I was a bit confused, yes.""
Blues skipper James, who was presented the trophy by Trump, added: ""They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage. I thought that he was going to exit the stage but he wanted to stay.""
Asked what Trump had said to him, James added: ""To be honest, it was quite loud. I couldn't hear too much.
""He just congratulated me and the team for lifting the trophy and told us to enjoy the moment.""
Meanwhile, Palmer revelled in proving Chelsea's doubters wrong as they claimed their second Club World Cup trophy with a superb victory over the European champions.
Palmer found the same corner of Gianluigi Donnarumma's net twice in eight first-half minutes before setting up Joao Pedro for Chelsea's third goal as they claimed their second trophy of the season following their Conference League win.
PSG had been heavily fancied to lift the trophy and complete a quadruple after thrashing Real Madrid 4-0 in the semi-finals, but they could not recover after Chelsea's rampant first-half showing, and had Joao Neves sent off for a hair-pull on Marc Cucurella.
Palmer's goals came almost exactly a year after he scored in England's Euro 2024 final loss to Spain, but this time there was never any doubt they would lead to a victory which, according to the 23-year-old, was made all the sweeter by the pre-match expectations.
""Obviously it's a great feeling,"" Palmer said on DAZN. ""Even better because obviously everyone doubted us before the game.
""But to go out there and put a fight on like we did against a great team, it's good.""
""I like finals and it happened again,"" he added of his goals, which equalled his total for his previous 29 appearances for club and country combined and took him to 18 for the season in total.
""The gaffer put a great game plan out. He knew where the space was going to be. I just had to repay him and score some goals.""
""He's building something special, something important,"" he added of head coach Enzo Maresca. ""I feel like we are going in the right direction.""
Maresca said: ""Today we found a position for him where there was space to attack.
""I'm happy for Cole but the effort from all the players has been fantastic.""
In a showpiece fixture which featured lengthy pre- and half-time shows more typical of NFL games, and was watched Trump, Maresca insisted he saw the win coming before their 22nd-minute opener.
""No words for the players,"" he said. ""They deserve it. It's a good moment.
""For me, we won the game in the first 10 minutes. In the first 10 minutes we set the tempo for the way we want to play. We were very good.
""Unfortunately with the weather conditions it is not easy to do for 90 minutes, but I think we won the game in the first 10 minutes.""
Chelsea now face a quick turnaround to the new season, beginning their Premier League campaign live on Sky Sports against Crystal Palace in only a month's time on August 17.
""Our future is very exciting,"" added Maresca. ""But I'm more excited for three weeks off!""
Sky Sports' Nick Wright:
Palmer was pictured riding a scooter through Times Square in the build-up to the final. He revelled in the same child-like freedom on the pitch at the MetLife Stadium.
The 23-year-old had only scored twice in his previous 29 appearances going into the game. The second half of this epic season has not always been easy for him. But he lived up to his nickname with his finishes for Chelsea's first two goals.
Both were dispatched with unerring calm, out of reach of the towering figure of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who had only been beaten once all tournament, and into the same corner of the net.
He showed his creative abilities for the third goal, punishing the space afforded to him by Paris Saint-Germain as he carried the ball forward before timing his pass perfectly for Joao Pedro.
Palmer continued in the same vein, playing with a carefree swagger even as PSG began to lose their heads, at one point drawing cheers from the crowd when he kept the ball in play by backheeling it through the legs of Fabian Ruiz.
He treated his interaction with the US president Donald Trump with the same apparent nonchalance as he collected his winner's medal and the best player of the tournament award. But as PSG now know, this is a player to be taken seriously.

Arsenal close to agreeing deal to sign Gyokeres,Arsenal are close to reaching a total agreement for the signing of Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13393585/viktor-gyokeres-transfer-news-arsenal-close-to-agreeing-deal-for-sporting-striker,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 20:40:00",,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal are close to reaching a total agreement for the signing of Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting.
The Premier League club are expected to pay a fixed fee of £55m (€63.5M) while add-ons are still being finalised and could reach up to £8.6M (€10m).
It is understood there was a breakthrough in negotiations when Gyokeres' agent agreed to waive a commission he was due from the deal.
This lowered the asking price for Arsenal on the guaranteed money without Sporting receiving less than they wanted.
Bringing in a striker has been a primary focus for Arsenal in this transfer window - they have explored conditions for a number of players, including RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
Sky Sports News reported in June that Gyokeres was a Manchester United target after they made an initial approach for him through intermediaries.
Last month, Sporting president Frederico Varandas revealed Gyokeres would not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer after disputing the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with the Swede's agent that would allow him to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m), plus £8.4m (€10m) in add ons.
After joining Sporting from Coventry City for around £20m in 2023, Gyokeres has scored an incredible 97 goals in just 102 matches during his two seasons in the Portuguese capital.
Gyokeres netted 54 goals in only 52 games in all competitions last campaign, including a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League, as he helped Sporting win the league and the Portuguese Cup.
A move to Arsenal would see Gyokeres return to English football, having joined Brighton & Hove Albion in January 2018, before moving to Coventry after loan spells at St Pauli and Swansea City.
Gyokeres scored 43 goals for Coventry in his two-and-a-half seasons with the Championship side.
Sky Sports' Nick Wright:
Sporting are expected to make a huge profit on Gyokeres's anticipated sale.
The 27-year-old, who joined Coventry on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.
His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him almost treble in value to £64.8m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.
He has proved a late bloomer, but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.
Developments around Gyokeres come amid a busy summer of incomings at Arsenal.
They have announced the signing of midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a £51m deal. And another central midfielder, Christian Norgaard, arrived from Brentford for £15m.
Spaniard Kepa Arrizabalaga was signed for £5m from Chelsea, while Arsenal are close to signing another player from their London rivals, after agreeing a £52m deal for Noni Madueke.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Emotional Jota tributes at Liverpool's first game since tragic death,Emotional tributes were paid to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva ahead of Liverpool's first game since their passing.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396043/diogo-jota-liverpool-pay-tribute-to-forward-and-his-brother-andre-silva-in-pre-season-friendly-against-preston,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 17:16:00",,['Liverpool'],"Emotional tributes were paid to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva ahead of Liverpool's first game since their passing.
A rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' echoed around Deepdale ahead of the friendly as Preston North End captain Ben Whiteman laid a wreath in their honour in front of the Liverpool fans.
Players then emerged from the tunnel, led by captains Mohamed Salah and Whiteman, as supporters held up various flags and banners while singing Jota's name.
A moment of silence in remembrance of Jota and Silva was then held before kick-off, with both sets of players around the centre circle.
During the minutes' silence, digital tributes were displayed on the stadium's big screen and on pitchside LED boards. Players from both teams wore black armbands.
The crowd sang Jota's name once again when the fixture entered the 20th minute of play.
Liverpool confirmed before the friendly that the number 20 shirt would be permanently retired across all levels at the club in honour of the forward.
The match at Deepdale was the Reds' first since Liverpool forward Jota and his brother were killed in a car crash in Spain on July 3.
The pre-match programme also featured written tributes to Jota and Silva.
""We will always carry him with us in our hearts, in our thoughts, wherever we go,"" Slot said on the Liverpool website. ""In any moment we are here, we will carry him with us in our thoughts and in our hearts. To retire his shirt is the one thing we could, should and have done…
""I think what I take comfort in [is that] in the last month of his life he was a champion in everything. A champion for his family, which is the main and most important thing, because he got married.
""A champion for his country because he won the Nations League, [with] a country that he cared about so much, because he also wore the flag when we had celebrations. And of course a champion for us by winning the Premier League.""
Slot said ahead of Sunday's game: ""Nothing seems to be important if we think of what has happened. But we are a football club and we need to train and we need to play again, if we want it or not.
""It's very difficult to find the right words because we constantly debate what is appropriate. What is appropriate in our actions? What is appropriate [for] what we have to say? Can we train again? Can we laugh again? Can we be angry if there's a wrong decision?
""And I've said to them, maybe the best thing for us to do is handle this situation like Jota was. And what I meant with that is that Jota was always himself, it didn't matter if he was talking to me, to his teammates, to the staff, he was always himself. So let us try to be ourselves as well.""
Liverpool went on to win the fixture 3-1 thanks to goals from Conor Bradley, Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo.
All three players paid individual tributes to Jota after scoring on the evening.
Bradley looked up to the heavens as he walked back into position, Nunez did two of Jota's signature celebrations in front of the away fans and Gakpo signalled the number 20 with his hands.
After the game, the entire squad approached the travelling away fans and applauded them as they sang Jota's name yet again.
Captain Virgil van Dijk and winger Luis Diaz were both present despite not being involved in the game itself.
Andy Robertson looked visibly emotional during the applause and had to walk away from the rest of his teammates.

'We've never seen a team do this to PSG' - how Chelsea won Club World Cup,How did Enzo Maresca's Chelsea manage to dominate Paris St-Germain so much in the Club World Cup final - and how good are the Blues?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvgne2e7y8yo,"Mon, 14 Jul 2025 00:12:44",Emlyn Begley,['Chelsea'],"""I can't believe what I'm seeing.""
Few could.
Paris St-Germain have been swatting aside all-comers all season, from wrapping up the Ligue 1 title in early April to demolishing Inter Milan in a Champions League final so one-sided it was scarcely believable.
They seemed to be breezing through the Club World Cup in similar fashion, too, beating Bayern Munich with nine men and then thrashing Real Madrid 4-0 on their way to Sunday's final.
But, heavily tipped to cruise past Chelsea in New Jersey, this time it was the Parisians who were left stunned.
Even before Coldplay's colourful half-time show arrived, Cole Palmer had scored two superb goals and created another for Joao Pedro to put the Blues 3-0 up. That is how it ended.
""I've never seen PSG turn the ball over as much as they have in this first half,"" said former England midfielder Andros Townsend on Dazn.
""Full credit to Chelsea for their willingness to track the ball in this New York heat.""
It was Townsend who said he could not believe the scenes playing out on the MetLife Stadium pitch. There was widespread astonishment.
As fellow pundit Gareth Bale put it: ""PSG have been PSG'd.""
So how did Enzo Maresca's side manage it? And just how good are Chelsea?
Palmer thrives as Blues produce 'tactical masterclass'
As has often been the case over the past two years, Palmer playing well meant Chelsea played well.
The 23-year-old has operated predominantly down the middle as a conventional number 10 for much of this season, but at times he struggled in that position. At one point he went 18 games without scoring and recently admitted he had endured a ""difficult time these past whatever months on and off the pitch"".
However, having been moved back out to the right during this tournament - a position he made his own under previous boss Mauricio Pochettino - he has looked somewhere near his best again.
Chelsea had clearly prioritised a fast start in the final, with Maresca saying he thought they ""won the game in the first 10 minutes"", with their aggressive approach and high press putting their opponents under unfamiliar stress.
""The idea was go man-to-man because if you leave spaces to PSG they will kill you, so we tried to be very aggressive and suffocate them early on and that intensity was crucial in the first 10 minutes,"" Maresca said.
Once Chelsea had asserted their authority, it was then obvious they were keen to target PSG's left-hand side, as Joao Pedro frequently drifted out wide to pair up with Palmer.
Their method was often direct, with passes dropped in behind the PSG defence, but it meant left-back Nuno Mendes was given a torrid time.
""We had a lot of success exploring the left side of their defence,"" said Maresca. ""Things worked perfectly for us due to the effort the players put.""
Townsend described it as a ""tactical masterclass"".
""That's what they've done - they've stretched this PSG defence, we've never seen a team do this to them,"" added ex-Chelsea midfielder John Mikel Obi.
'We value it as much as the Champions League... perhaps even more'
There has been much debate about how much this newly expanded competition means.
But the trophy does mean you can call yourself world champions - until the next competition is played, scheduled for 2029. And Chelsea will be able to wear a badge on their kit to reiterate it.
It's also been worth between £80m and £90m in prize money.
""The fans will have bragging rights for the next four years,"" said Townsend.
""Nobody will be able to say anything to Chelsea fans because they are world champions - not for one year but for four years until 2029. Wow, what an achievement.""
And there was no doubting how much it meant to the players and staff, who celebrated it as enthusiastically as they would have a Champions League or Premier League trophy.
Their players clashed with PSG's team on the pitch afterwards, with the French champions visibly upset with the defeat - with Blues boss Maresca acting as peacekeeper.
""I feel that this competition will be as important as or even more important than the Champions League,"" said Maresca.
""I was lucky enough to be part of a coaching staff [at Manchester City] that won the Champions League three years ago, but this competition features the best clubs in the world. That's why we value it as much as the Champions League, or perhaps even more.
""For us, it was a great triumph. Allowing Chelsea fans to wear that world champion patch on their shirts is a source of pride for us.""
Palmer added: ""It's a great feeling. Even better because everyone doubted us before the game, we knew that. To put a fight on like we did, it's good.""
A statement win - and a sign of things to come?
Many have laughed at Chelsea's recruitment under Todd Boehly. They have spent somewhere in the region of £1.5bn on players since his takeover in 2022 - and handed out a host of contracts lasting seven, eight and nine years.
Eighteen months ago Gary Neville called them ""billion-pound bottle-jobs"" after they lost the Carabao Cup final to Liverpool.
But after the Conference League and Club World Cup trophies this year they are actually looking good. They had the youngest squad of any team at the Club World Cup, with no player older than 27. So they should only get better.
So could they think of challenging for the Premier League title now?
Wales legend Gareth Bale, watching for Dazn, said: ""I don't think they're far off at all. Last season before Christmas everyone was talking about them as contenders.
""Obviously they're a young team and fell, but I think they'll learn a lot from that. They've shown a lot of character to come back and win the Conference League and now this. Confidence will be booming - they'll have that self-belief now.""
BBC Sport reporter Nizaar Kinsella, who was watching at the MetLife Stadium, said: ""Chelsea are firmly behind Maresca and there is a sense of stability about the club for the first time since the UK government placed sanctions on Roman Abramovich after the war in Ukraine started in March 2022.
""This is a new club - but one capable of winning again - and those involved want recognition for their achievements.
""Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez should be considered among the best midfielders in the world. Marc Cucurella is arguably the best left-back in the Premier League and potentially in the world.
""There is promising talent coming through like Levi Colwill, Malo Gusto and newer players like Andrey Santos.
""Joao Pedro has three goals in three Club World Cup matches and was crucial to Chelsea's tournament success, while fellow striker signing Liam Delap has looked lively in the United States.
""Another new signing - Jamie Gittens - has yet to join from Dortmund, with Palmeiras' teenage sensation Estevao Willian also joining for pre-season in August.""

Tributes to Jota and Silva at Liverpool friendly,Tributes have been paid to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva ahead of Liverpool's first match since they died in a car crash.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz7l85y42n5o,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:41:12",Sam Drury,['Liverpool'],"Tributes have been paid to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva at Liverpool's first match since their death.
Portugal and Liverpool forward Jota and Silva, also a professional footballer, died in a car crash on 3 July in the Spanish province of Zamora.
Prior to the Reds' first pre-season friendly at Preston North End, there were emotional renditions of Elvis Presley's Can't Help Falling in Love and Liverpool club anthem You'll Never Walk Alone.
During the latter, a visibly emotional Preston captain Ben Whiteman laid a wreath in front of the travelling Liverpool supporters.
The away end, filled with flags and scarves commemorating the former Porto and Wolves attacker, loudly sang Jota's song as the players walked out before an impeccably observed minute's silence.
At the start of the 20th minute, the crowd burst into another rendition of Jota's song.
There was a muted celebration when Conor Bradley opened the scoring for Liverpool, with the full-back looking up to the heavens as he walked back to his position.
Striker Darwin Nunez scored the Reds' second and paid his own tribute by doing two of Jota's celebrations in front of the Liverpool fans.
Cody Gakpo followed suit after adding the third in a 3-1 win and then held his fingers up to signal the number 20, Jota's squad number at Liverpool.
The match programme had a black and white picture of Jota holding the Premier League trophy and featured tributes to the Liverpool player and his brother.
Liverpool have retired Jota's number 20 shirt across all areas of the club, making the announcement at 20:20 BST on Friday.
In his first interview since Jota's death, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot told Liverpool TV: ""If we want to laugh, we laugh; if we want to cry, we're going to cry.
""If they want to train they can train, if they don't want to train they can not train. But be yourself, don't think you have to be different than your emotions tell you.
""We will always carry him with us in our hearts, in our thoughts, wherever we go.""
Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for Liverpool, helping them win the FA Cup and League Cup in 2022 and the Premier League title last season.
He played his final match for Portugal as they beat Spain in the final of the Nations League on 8 June. He scored 14 goals in 49 internationals.
The Guardia Civil told BBC Sport that Jota and his brother died after their car, a Lamborghini, left the road due to a tyre blowout while overtaking another vehicle.
The brothers had been heading to the Spanish port of Santander so Jota could return to Liverpool for pre-season training.
Emotional Liverpool fans 'very proud' of team
Thousands of Liverpool fans travelled to Deepdale, in practice to watch their team undertake their first run-out of the new campaign, but in reality to pay tribute to Jota and Silva and to show support to the team and coaching staff.
Those who packed out the Bill Shankly Kop belted out Jota's name before kick-off and followed that up with regular airing throughout the match, with Preston supporters joining them, standing and clapping along in rhythm, for a rendition in the 20th minute.
Fans brought with them whatever they could to demonstrate their love for a player whose tenacity, knack for scoring important goals in big games, and gregarious character made him one of the most highly thought-of players during the club's recent period of success under Jurgen Klopp and Slot.
""I feel very emotional,"" Liverpool fan Jane, wearing a custom T-shirt dedicated to Jota, said. ""I feel very proud of my team and all the tributes they've put together.""
One fan, Mathew, told me about the challenge of explaining Jota's death to his young children.
""It has been really difficult,"" he said. ""I told my seven-year-old on the morning it happened and he just burst into tears. It's very hard for him to understand.""
Mathew's 15-year-old son Rafael – named after Champions League-winning Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez - added: ""I feel gutted. But Liverpool is a family and we've all come together to pay our respects in the right way.""
Liverpool's anthem, You'll Never Walk Alone, has taken on many different roles throughout the club's history, in times of both triumph and tragedy, but has never before been sung quite in this way or for quite this reason.
The way in which it was bellowed this afternoon conveyed an immense depth of feeling for a footballer adored by followers of his club, while for those on the pitch, playing without him for the first time will have been just one of many important stages of their grief.
There have scarcely been football matches less important than this, and yet, very few which have been imbued with as much meaning, emotion, and sheer love by those who made sure they were there to play their part.

Arsenal close to finalising Gyokeres deal,Arsenal expect to reach a full agreement with Sporting inside the next 24 hours for the 73.5m euros (£63.5m) signing of Viktor Gyokeres.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm2mk4ve081o,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 18:23:59",Sami Mokbel,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal expect to reach a full agreement with Sporting inside the next 24 hours for the 73.5m euros (£63.5m) signing of Viktor Gyokeres.
Sources have told BBC Sport that a club-to-club deal for the Sweden forward is now in place with just minor details left to resolve.
All parties are working towards the signing being completed in time for Gyokeres to travel with the Gunners to Asia for their pre-season tour at the end of the week.
The offer, inclusive of add-ons, is an improvement on Arsenal's previous proposal of 70m euros (£60m).
Gyokeres, 27, has already agreed terms on a five-year deal.
BBC Sport revealed at the start of the month how Arsenal had turned their attentions to Gyokeres after hitting an impasse in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.
Gunners sporting director Andrea Berta flew to Lisbon towards the end of last week to lead negotiations with Sporting.
This weekend, Sporting's president Frederico Varandas said Gyokeres was facing disciplinary action after failing to report for pre-season training.
Gyokeres, who scored 54 goals in 52 games last season, has yet to publicly explain why he has not turned up for pre-season.
Varandas told Portuguese news agency Lusa that ""no one is above the interests of the club"".
Former Brighton and Coventry striker Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 matches during his two seasons in Portugal, firing Sporting to two league titles.

What is appropriate [for] what we have to say? Can we train again? Can we laugh again? Can we be angry if there's a wrong decision?
""And I've said to them, maybe the best thing for us to do is handle this situation like Jota was. And what I meant with that is that Jota was always himself, it didn't matter if he was talking to me, to his team-mates, to the staff, he was always himself. So let us try to be ourselves as well.""
Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for Liverpool, helping them win the FA Cup and League Cup in 2022 and the Premier League title last season.
He played his final match for Portugal as they beat Spain in the final of the Nations League on 8 June. He scored 14 goals in 49 internationals.
The Guardia Civil told BBC Sport that Jota and his brother died after their car, a Lamborghini, left the road due to a tyre blowout while overtaking another vehicle.
The brothers had been heading to the Spanish port of Santander so Jota could return to Liverpool for pre-season training.

"Cazorla, 40, signs new Oviedo deal before La Liga return","Former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla, 40, signs a new one-year contract with boyhood club Real Oviedo as they prepare to return to the Spanish top flight.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp3kl267406o,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 09:03:10",Matt Davis,['Arsenal'],"Former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla, 40, has signed a new one-year contract with boyhood club Real Oviedo as they prepare to return to the Spanish top flight.
Cazorla who returned to the club 2023, played a key role last season as Oviedo won promotion to La Liga for the first time in 24 years.
He scored the decisive goal in the La Liga 2 play-off semi-final tie against Almeria, coming off the bench to convert a free-kick and secure a 3-2 aggregate victory.
The former Spain international then scored a penalty in the second leg of the final as they beat CD Mirandes in extra time.
""With this renewal, Santi Cazorla, a symbol and emblem of Oviedo, proves that dreams, when pursued with the heart, come true,"" the Asturian club said.
""Real Oviedo secures the leadership of a footballer who embodies the Club's values like few others, both on and off the field.""
Cazorla who turns 41 in December, scored five goals and registered five assists in 35 games last season.
A two-time European champion with Spain, the midfielder spent six years at Arsenal and made 180 appearances before leaving in 2018.
He suffered an Achilles injury in October 2016, going on to have 11 operations to cure the problem.
One of the operations led to gangrene with doctors telling Cazorla he should be satisfied to walk again, never mind play.

Chelsea stun PSG to win Club World Cup after Cole Palmer’s cool double,Final: Chelsea 3-0 Paris Saint-Germain,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/chelsea-stun-psg-to-win-club-world-cup-after-cole-palmers-cool-double,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 21:17:15",Sid Lowe,['Chelsea'],"The boy from Wythenshawe who had sat on top of the Rockefeller on Friday took Chelsea to the top of the world on Sunday, that shiver celebration shown to everyone. It was 90F (32C) in New Jersey, humid too, but oh, this was cold, all right.
Two wonderful, almost identical strikes, executed with an effortless ease, and a lovely soft-shoed assist from Cole Palmer led Chelsea to the expanded Club World Cup. That Tiffany trophy, a great, big gold coin, had their name engraved into it alongside Gianni Infantino’s, the billion-dollar team that won the billion-dollar competition.
It was handed to them by Donald Trump, who was booed when he appeared and hung about in the picture for a bit before Chelsea’s players pushed in front of him on the podium. Reece James lifted it, fireworks went off and Blue is the Colour went round. They had done it.
Paris Saint-Germain had seemed peerless, a side that shifted the paradigm, but the European champions could not beat Robert Sánchez at one end – the goalkeeper one of many outstanding performers – and were picked off at the other, victims of a perfect plan.
This hadn’t been what PSG, or anyone, expected and at the final whistle they lost the plot, confrontations sparked on the pitch. Somewhere in the crowd, the coach Luis Enrique seemed to grab at João Pedro’s throat just as João Neves had grabbed at Marc Cucurella’s hair in the dying minutes of the match, their dreadful afternoon wrapped up with a red card.
For Chelsea, it could not have gone any better, and almost from the start. Ultimately, they had won this inside 30 minutes, which is what their opponents were supposed to do.
“We know that they begin games very fast, very strong,” Cucurella had said but while Ousmane Dembélé almost caught Sánchez 95 seconds in, it was Chelsea who did so. The first chance was theirs inside 10 minutes and it was so close that some in this stadium celebrated, João Pedro teeing up Palmer for a shot that bent just past the post. That, it turned out was just a sighter; next time, the MetLife could let go for real.
Chelsea’s plan was clear: quick into the challenge, quicker to send the ball into the space behind PSG, starting with Sánchez directly from his own area. PSG might have led early when Désiré Doué cut back to Kvaratskhelia instead of taking the shot himself before seeing another effort stopped by a superb low save from Sánchez.
It was also true that they took a degree of control in that phase and beyond, possession eventually up near 70% but Chelsea had anticipated that and the advantage was quickly theirs, 1-0 up on 22 minutes.
Sánchez’s diagonal went right where Nuno Mendes, buffeted, didn’t judge the leap well. Suddenly, Malo Gusto was away, space opening on the wing before him and he cut into the area, ready to shoot. Lucas Beraldo blocked the first effort but Gusto retrieved the ball and laid into the path of Palmer who opened up his body and curled it into the bottom of the net. Off he went, holding himself.
The shot with which he made it 2-0 eight minutes later was almost identical. Coming in from the right, Palmer saw Gusto fly up outside him. So, and this was the key, did the PSG defence. A slight pause, a little shuffle of the hips was enough to clear Beraldo and Marquinhos from his path and Palmer put the ball in the same square of the net. In half an hour, he had taken almost the same shot three times. Two had gone in, the other looked like it had, the title within touching distance already.
Not that Palmer was finished. Just before half-time, he carried the ball from near halfway and slipped the ball through. The pass was smooth, so was the finish from João Pedro, dinked over Gigi Donnarumma as if he was playing on the beach, which 10 days ago he was.
Chelsea had completed only 126 passes at that point, but that was at least partly by clinical design, producing three shots clearly constructed and calmly executed, giving them a lead that wasn’t for overturning. Which isn’t to say PSG didn’t try after a 24-minute half-time. Sánchez almost immediately had to get to the feet of Fabián Ruiz and then scramble away Kvaratskhelia’s shot before making an excellent close-range stop from Dembélé.
Chelsea got deeper and were not always in a hurry to get the ball back. When they did, they tried to keep it, each pass greeted with olés, the match managed expertly. Sánchez dived to save Vitinha’s dipping effort but only rarely did Chelsea feel under the kind of pressure that would prise the trophy from their hands.
In fact, if anyone was going to score again, it was Liam Delap, who twice went close, as down the on the bench the T-shirts were handed out. World champions 2025, they said.

Liverpool and Preston players and fans remember ‘champion’ Diogo Jota,"As Liverpool play their first game since the forward’s tragic death, Arne Slot says the best way to move on is to be ‘like Jota was’",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/liverpool-and-preston-players-and-fans-remember-champion-diogo-jota,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 17:44:08",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"The first rendition of “Oh, his name is Diogo” came 20 minutes before kick-off and, 20 minutes into Liverpool’s first game since the tragic deaths of Diogo Jota and André Silva, the entire crowd at Preston’s Deepdale stadium stood to honour their memory. Mohamed Salah was visibly moved by the ovation for his club’s “Forever 20”. It was the aftermath of a poignant and important afternoon for Liverpool that left the deepest impression, however.
For seven minutes after the pre‑season friendly, staged 10 days after the brothers were killed in a car accident in north‑western Spain, Liverpool fans in the Bill Shankly Stand sang Jota’s name on repeat. And for those seven minutes Liverpool’s players, coaches and backroom staff stood facing their fans and clapped in unison with the tribute. The connection and the release, if only brief and only temporary, vindicated Liverpool’s decision to get back to work and play.
Deepdale delivered thoughtful tributes throughout Liverpool’s 3-1 win. Preston’s captain, Ben Whiteman, walked out alone before kick-off carrying a wreath he laid in front of the away fans, while You’ll Never Walk Alone was sung beautifully and an image of Jota and Silva from their Porto days filled the giant screen.
Understandably, Liverpool did not conduct any pre- or post-match interviews but Arne Slot spoke movingly to the club’s in-house media before the game. The head coach spoke of finding comfort in the fact that Jota “in the last month of his life, he was a champion in everything” – with Liverpool, Portugal and his young family, having married Rute Cardoso 11 days before his death. Slot added that the support Liverpool have received not only from their own fans but from Everton, from around the country and across the world meant that “to represent this club in this city now even means more to me and to my wife than it did before”.
Slot’s take on the friendly itself was powerful. His message could also apply to what lies ahead for Liverpool in what is certain to be the most trying of seasons. Should Jota’s grieving teammates retain their Premier League title it will rank as a truly extraordinary achievement, along with a fitting and emotional tribute. And if they don’t, well, it will not really matter.
“Nothing seems to be important if we think of what has happened,” said Slot. “But we are a football club and we need to train and we need to play again, if we want it or not. What I’ve said to the players, I can say it here as well. It’s very difficult to find the right words because we constantly debate what is appropriate. What is appropriate in our actions? What is appropriate [for] what we have to say? Can we train again? Can we laugh again? Can we be angry if there’s a wrong decision?
“I’ve said to them, maybe the best thing for us to do is handle this situation like Jota was. And what I meant with that is that Jota was always himself, it didn’t matter if he was talking to me, to his teammates, to the staff, he was always himself. So let us try to be ourselves as well. So, if we want to laugh we laugh; if we want to cry we’re going to cry. If they want to train they can train, if they don’t want to train they can not train. But be yourself, don’t think you have to be different than your emotions tell you.”
Salah’s reaction to the 20th minute ovation for Jota, putting his hands to his face and shaking his head as the crowd rose around him, reinforced Slot’s point. So too did Darwin Núñez’s response to scoring Liverpool’s second goal. Having capitalised on a weak back-pass to round Preston’s goalkeeper, Daniel Iversen, the Uruguay international re-enacted two of Jota’s goal celebrations – the “Baby Shark” he performed for his children after scoring against Everton and the “gamer” celebration that has now become a tribute to him from footballers all over the world. Cody Gakpo also did the shark celebration after completing Liverpool’s win.
The goal meant much more to Núñez than it would in normal circumstances and he pointed to the heavens after his Jota‑inspired celebrations. It was a small cathartic moment in keeping with the entire occasion for Liverpool.

Arsenal agree €63.5m Viktor Gyökeres deal with Sporting with add-ons being discussed,Total cost of deal likely to be close to €80m,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/arsenal-agree-635m-viktor-gyokeres-deal-with-sporting-with-add-ons-still-being-discussed,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 20:39:10",Ed Aarons,['Arsenal'],"Arsenal have agreed to pay €63.5m (£55m) up front for Viktor ­Gyökeres and are close to a complete ­agreement with Sporting over the Sweden striker.
It is understood the clubs remain in negotiations over ­potential add-ons that could take the total cost of the deal close to €80m, with ­Arsenal believed to have offered a further €15m in performance‑related bonuses for the 27-year-old forward.
However, with Gyökeres facing disciplinary action from Sporting after he missed his deadline to report for pre-season training on Saturday, there is confidence in both camps that an ­agreement will be reached and the deal is expected to be ­finalised in the coming days.
The Guardian understands that the agents involved in the transfer will not receive the customary commission – typically about 10% of the deal’s total value – clearing the way for Sporting to receive a larger sum up front. If Arsenal had met ­Sporting’s initial €70m asking price under stan­dard terms, the Portuguese club would have netted roughly €63m after fees. Under the new arrangement, they will receive slightly more without losing a cut to intermediaries.
Tensions between Gyökeres and Sporting have grown in recent weeks as he has made no secret of his desire to join ­Arsenal. But their president, Frederico ­Varandas, had insisted they would not budge over their valuation of a player who scored 54 times in 52 games last season. He confirmed that Sporting intend to fine Gyökeres unless he can present a legitimate justification for his absence, such as medical reasons, extended leave authorised by the board, or an urgent family matter.
“We are calm,” Varandas said on Saturday evening. “Everything can be resolved with the close of the transfer window, a heavy fine and an apology to the group.” With ­reference to Arsenal he said: “If they don’t want to pay Viktor’s fair market value we are very comfortable with that for the next three years.”
Arsenal are also expected to make a new approach for Christian Mosquera this week after their initial bid of £14m was rejected by Valencia. The Spain Under-21 defender has already agreed personal terms for a move to the Emirates Stadium.
Leandro Trossard could be sold to help balance the books, with Bayern Munich the latest club to show an interest in him. The Belgium forward has also been linked with Fenerbahce and clubs in Saudi Arabia and is likely to cost around £20m.
Noni Madueke is close to finalising his £52m move from Chelsea to Arsenal and is poised for his medical this week. The 23-year-old will sign a five-year contract.
Arsenal have also made progress in negotiations over a new contract for Ethan Nwaneri, who has attracted interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany but is expected to join his fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skelly in agreeing a deal to stay.

West Ham eye move for Liverpool’s Elliott and close on Slavia Prague’s Diouf,Graham Potter looking to reinvest after Kudus sale,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/west-ham-eye-22m-move-for-slavia-pragues-el-hadji-malick-diouf,"Sun, 13 Jul 2025 17:55:05",Jacob Steinberg,"['Liverpool', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","West Ham are looking to ramp up their summer rebuild with an ambitious move for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott. The London club are close to completing the signing of the Slavia Prague left-back El Hadji Malick Diouf and want to make further additions after boosting their budget with the £54.5m sale of Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham.
Kudus’s departure leaves room for West Ham to bring in an attacking midfielder and they have identified Elliott as a key target. The 22-year-old starred for England Under-21s during their triumphant European Championship campaign last month, scoring five goals in six games, and has suggested that he may consider his future at Liverpool because of his lack of regular starts.
West Ham are yet to submit a bid for Elliott and it remains to be seen how much Liverpool would want for the former Fulham player. Preparations for a move are being conducted, though, and there is optimism at West Ham that a deal will be possible. RB Leipzig have also been credited with an interest in Elliott, who can play in a range of positions across the front line. Liverpool may regard this as the right time to cash in on the player but there are obvious sensitivities around their transfer plans following the death of Diogo Jota.
Potter, who was hired in January, is looking to freshen up his squad. West Ham’s manager wants young, hungry, dynamic players and is also focusing on lifting the atmosphere in the dressing room. Kyle Macaulay is heading up the club’s recruitment after joining from Chelsea and is looking to be creative with his signings.
Elliott, who can play wide and in the middle, joined Liverpool in 2019 and has found it difficult to establish himself as a regular starter despite offering flashes of quality. Only two of his 18 appearances in the league last season were starts. Arne Slot has plenty of options in attack and has been unable to find an obvious spot for him. West Ham’s current options on the flanks include Jarrod Bowen, Luis Guilherme and Crysencio Summerville, who is recovering from a hamstring injury.
West Ham, who are also considering the Liverpool midfielder Tyler Morton, will also look further afield for signings. They opened talks with Slavia over Diouf last month and negotiations over a deal worth £22m plus £5m in add-ons are almost complete.
Diouf, who can play as a left-back or a left wing-back, impressed for Senegal in their victory over England last month. The move for the 20-year-old will raise doubts over the future of Emerson Palmieri.
Potter is toying with the idea of using a 3-4-2-1 system, heightening the need for him to have defenders who can function as wing-backs. West Ham already have Aaron Wan-Bissaka on the opposite flank.
West Ham had to sell to buy but are pushing on with their plans after losing Kudus. They will also look to bring in a goalkeeper, a left centre-back, two central midfielders and a striker. They are keen to make further sales and are open to offers for Nayef Aguerd, Edson Álvarez, Guido Rodríguez and Niclas Füllkrug.
