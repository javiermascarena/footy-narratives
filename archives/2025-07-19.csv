Man Utd agree deal to sign Mbeumo,Manchester United have reached an agreement with Brentford to sign Bryan Mbeumo.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13389114/bryan-mbeumo-transfer-news-man-utd-reach-agreement-for-brentford-forward-after-improved-71m-offer,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 13:00:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have reached an agreement with Brentford to sign Bryan Mbeumo.
United submitted an improved offer of £65m plus £6m in add-ons on Thursday. Their previous bid of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons was rejected several weeks ago.
Now, their improved offer has been accepted by the Bees. The player has two years left on his current deal.
Mbeumo is now expected to have a medical at United in the coming days and there is growing optimism the forward will be part of the club's squad that flies out to the United States for their preseason tour on Tuesday.
Mbeumo is a player United have admired for a while and he is seen as a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system.
There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.
The focus for Manchester United will be on exits after Mbeumo's signing is completed.
Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.
But as Sky Sports News has been reporting all summer, United have been looking at No 9s.
They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.
Sky Sports News has been told one to keep an eye on as the window develops is RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.
United have been tracking his development for a number of years - back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg.
Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko but a deal never progressed. They are now close to signing Gyokeres.
Sky Sports Data Editor Adam Smith:
Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.
He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.
Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.
Only Mohamed Salah collected more form points than Mbeumo last term, according to the Sky Sports Power Rankings.
Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.
And 80 per cent of all televised Premier League games next season are on Sky Sports.

Arsenal sign Madueke from Chelsea for £52m,Arsenal have completed the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea in a deal worth &#163;52m.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13395330/noni-madueke-transfer-news-arsenal-complete-52m-deal-to-sign-england-international-from-rivals-chelsea,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 17:00:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Arsenal have completed the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea in a deal worth £52m.
Arsenal will pay an initial fee of £48.5m plus £3.5m in add-ons.
The winger has signed a five-year contract at the Emirates Stadium and becomes Arsenal's fourth signing of the summer after Kepa Arrizabalaga, Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard.
Madueke, who has seven caps for England, predominantly plays on the right wing but can also operate on the left. He is seen by Arsenal as a player who can add depth and quality to their attack.
The 23-year-old is the seventh player to make the move from Chelsea to Arsenal in the last six years, after Kepa, Raheem Sterling, Kai Havertz, Jorginho, Willian and David Luiz.
Madueke scored 20 goals in 92 games for Chelsea following his £29m arrival from PSV Eindhoven in 2023.
He helped them win the Conference League last season and also played a part in their Club World Cup triumph in the United States.
His Chelsea departure follows another round of heavy investment in their attack, with Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and Jamie Gittens having arrived from Ipswich, Brighton and Borussia Dortmund respectively.
Arsenal's pursuit of Noni Madueke has provoked a vociferous online reaction from fans. A poll conducted by Sky Sports shows voters feel he would be a bad signing. Some have even signed a petition against the deal.
For many, the frustration stems from Arsenal shopping at Chelsea again. Madueke becomes the seventh player in six years to move from Stamford Bridge to the Emirates Stadium. The list holds cautionary tales in David Luiz, Willian and Raheem Sterling.
Go back further and there are more examples, from William Gallas and Lassana Diarra to Petr Cech. Overall, it is clear which club has benefited most from the transactions. Even the more successful signings, most notably Kai Havertz, continue to split opinion.
The £65m fee paid for Havertz remains a subject of debate, two years on, and the finances involved in the deal for Madueke are even more contentious. Arsenal will pay up to £52m, allowing Chelsea to make a huge profit on a player they signed for £29m in 2023.
It is a hefty fee, particularly for a player who primarily plays in the same position as Bukayo Saka. Arsenal fans are entitled to wonder whether Madueke has done enough in the last two and a half years at Chelsea to justify a 70 per cent increase in his value.
A lack of end product has been a source of frustration. Madueke started last season with a hat-trick against Wolves in a 6-2 win at Molineux but went on to score only seven times and provide only three assists in 32 Premier League appearances in total.
Read Nick Wright's feature on why Madueke could suit Arsenal
""I want to thank you for the last three or so years. To every staff member that helped me along this journey, thank you. To my teammates thank you for everything, I leave with only love and admiration for you guys.
""We achieved so much this season and I honestly wish you guys nothing but the best. To Enzo Maresca, it was a privilege to play under you, thank you for trying to better me as a player and as a person.
""Lastly thank you to every single Chelsea fan. Thank you for the love, the praise and also the criticism, I appreciate it all. I leave here with nothing but fond memories.""
Sky Sports' Paul Merson:
""I am flabbergasted by Arsenal signing Noni Madueke. I'm shocked. If Arsenal went and bought any player from Chelsea, he'd have been the last one I thought they'd sign.
""I just don't see it. It's a lot of money for a player who is not a prolific goalscorer. He's the sort of player that has a good game here and a good game there, but that'll be it. The consistency of performance isn't there.
""I hope he proves me wrong, but he'll have the good games, just like he did for England last month. But then you won't see him for a few weeks.
""Call me a cynic, but is there another reason why they are doing this deal? Are there concerns about the future of Saka?
""Are they getting this deal done, and then all of a sudden it allows a potential sale of Saka or someone else?
""The one player at Arsenal who has to play every week is Saka. When he doesn't play, they are not the same team. The players around him are not the same when he doesn't play.
""If fit, he plays. So why do you spend £52m on a backup for him?""

It feels a hefty fee, particularly for a player who primarily plays in the same position as Bukayo Saka. Arsenal fans are entitled to wonder whether Madueke has done enough in the last two and a half years at Chelsea to justify a 70 per cent increase in his value.
A lack of end product has been a source of frustration. Madueke started last season with a hat-trick against Wolves in a 6-2 win at Molineux but went on to score only seven times and provide only three assists in 32 Premier League appearances in total.
The top-line numbers are modest but Arsenal will have noted that they could easily have been higher. Statistically, Madueke's shots were worth a total of 9.66 expected goals.
The fact he scored nearly three goals fewer than 'expected' can be interpreted as evidence he is a poor finisher but it is more likely down to variance. Last season looks an outlier; the first in Madueke's career in which he has significantly underperformed on his expected goals.
Arsenal will feel confident that a reversion to the mean could bring higher returns in future and, even amid questions over his end-product, there is no doubting the threat he provides.
Madueke ranked among the Premier League's top 15 players for non-penalty expected goals and expected assists combined per 90 minutes last season. He was in the top 10 for shots per 90 minutes and even higher for touches in the opposition box, in fifth.
Long-legged and upright, he is not the most aesthetically pleasing of players. His running style can appear awkward. But he is a quick and effective ball-carrier whose directness would give Arsenal another weapon on transitions and when breaking down compact defences.
Last season, he ranked top among all Premier League players for shot-ending carries per 90 minutes, on 1.63. His average of 1.98 successful dribbles put him nearly level with Saka (2.13) and a long way ahead of either Martinelli (1.29) or Leandro Trossard (1.34).
Of course, Madueke's best work has come from the right-hand side, where Saka has become a fixture in Mikel Arteta's team. The academy product is Arsenal's best and most important player.
Madueke's chance of usurping him looks slim. What he can do, though, is provide a high-quality alternative, sharing his England team-mate's workload and therefore lowering the risk of another injury like the hamstring tear that proved so costly last term.
Surely, though, Arsenal are not spending £50m just for a Saka back-up? Especially when they already have the hugely promising Ethan Nwaneri, whose development should remain a priority.
With reports suggesting Trossard could be sold this summer, Madueke is also expected to be used as an option on the left.
It is reasonable for Arsenal fans to feel underwhelmed at that prospect given previous links to more high-profile targets such as Real Madrid's Rodrygo. Madueke, unlike the Brazil international, is not even a natural on that side.
On the face of it, his appearances on the left for Chelsea in the final weeks of last season do not appear to offer much encouragement either. Madueke produced no goals or assists when starting on that side. He did, though, produce some encouraging displays.
There was a particularly eye-catching performance in a 1-0 win over Everton in April, when he forced a string of saves from Jordan Pickford. A week later, in a 3-1 win over Liverpool, he was similarly dangerous, with Arne Slot describing the problems caused by his dribbling as ""something he hadn't seen before"" against his side.
Madueke was subsequently used on the left by England boss Thomas Tuchel. He was one of few players to impress in their narrow World Cup qualifying win over Andorra last month.
Still, it is not the most compelling body of work.
Madueke was used almost exclusively on the right-hand side by former club PSV Eindhoven. Less than 10 per cent of his Premier League minutes have come on the left for Chelsea.
Madueke will need to prove his left-wing credentials to Arsenal fans. Some will say he also has something to prove in terms of his work rate and temperament.
Enzo Maresca clearly valued Madueke, starting him more times than any other Chelsea winger last season, but he also questioned the consistency of his application. ""Noni can do much more,"" he said in December, before dropping him for a game against Fulham. ""He has to understand that he has to train well every day.""
Maresca's comments, coupled with an unseemly dispute with team-mate Nicolas Jackson over a penalty against Everton last year, have contributed to shaping negative perceptions of Madueke but others who have coached him paint a very different picture.
Saul Isaksson-Hurst, a technical and skills specialist who has been working with Madueke on an individual basis since his time at PSV, described him as a ""mentality monster"" in conversation with Sky Sports before his move to Chelsea.
""He is so driven,"" he added. ""He's got such a clear vision of what he wants to do and he is willing to put the work in."" This is, after all, a young player who chose to leave Tottenham's academy for PSV at the age of only 16 in the interests of self-improvement.
Another coach who worked with Madueke in England's youth teams describes him in similar terms when asked by Sky Sports, saying he is a ""lovely lad"" who is ""driven to succeed and single-minded"", and who ""listens to the advice of his coaches.""
That same sentiment came across from Maresca's predecessor Mauricio Pochettino in May of last year, when, in the press room at Stamford Bridge after a win over Tottenham, he singled out Madueke for his ""unbelievable"" defensive work in helping rookie full-back Alfie Gilchrist deal with Heung-Min Son.
For Arteta, the hope is that he will be able to mould Madueke into the player he needs, whether that's on the right or the left.
But there is no escaping that it is a high-risk move at the price. On some levels, the doubts of supporters are understandable. Madueke is not an obvious upgrade on either flank. He does, though, have exciting tools to work with, and, at 23, potential to be tapped into.
From next season, Sky Sports' Premier League coverage will increase from 128 matches to at least 215 games exclusively live.

Brave. Aggressive. Attacking - Frank sets out Spurs vision,"Tottenham will be brave, aggressive and attacking next season, says Thomas Frank, as the club's new head coach laid out his vision.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13398526/thomas-frank-spurs-boss-outlines-vision-ambitions-and-reacts-to-transfer-stories-in-first-press-conference,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 16:35:00",Peter Smith,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham will be brave, aggressive and attacking next season, says Thomas Frank, as the club's new head coach laid out his vision.
During an at-times light-hearted first press conference as Spurs boss, Frank joked about the ""different surroundings"" of the club's high-end press facilities at the training ground, in contrast to the more modest set-up he has been used to during his seven-year tenure at Brentford.
He also acknowledged that he is in the honeymoon period of this role. ""Everyone's happy, the sun is shining…""
But a football coach doesn't go from managing in Denmark to taking charge of the Europa League winners - via a supremely impressive spell maximising the potential of Brentford - without a clear philosophy.
Frank's is entwined with the motto of Spurs.
""I'm very clear on the principles on every phase of the game. I want us to be brave and very aggressive. I also want to attack,"" he said.
""Brave is absolutely linked [with] 'To dare is to do'. If you are not brave, it is difficult to achieve anything. Brave is crucial. The aggressivity is crucial if you want to win or achieve something. And you need to attack.""
Whether Frank is given the time to deliver that plan was another theme of his opening exchanges with the media as Spurs boss.
His predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, was sacked despite winning the Europa League. Frank says the Australian will ""forever be a legend here"" for that achievement but his dismissal reflected the ruthlessness of chairman Daniel Levy, who axed five managers during the time Frank led Brentford.
""Only five?! I like to challenge myself and I have never been sacked before, that's one reason I took the job, to get more risk into my daily life,"" laughed the Dane. For now, he is confident he will be given the time to deliver on his aims.
""Coming to a big club, there is pressure. We need to perform, it's me, the staff and the players. We have to do it together,"" he said. ""I like the ambitions and everything I do, every decision I make so far, is not about surviving one game or one year. It is for the long-run.
""I will do everything, every day, to work towards taking this club to new heights. That is the ambition.
""If I was not ambitious, I would not sit here. I am looking forward to it.""
Where those new heights might deliver Tottenham to were not expressly named by Frank. He admitted the Premier League's top sides are currently a way ahead of a Spurs team which finished 17th last season.
But the target is to build a group capable of competing in multiple fronts - and interesting statement, given how Postecoglou admitted he prioritised Europa League progress over Premier League results in the second half of last season.
""It was positive they won. They got the trophy that this club deserved,"" said Frank when asked about building on that Spurs triumph over Man Utd in Bilbao.
""Hopefully we can add to that. The first aim is to be able to compete in all four tournaments.
""That has to be the ambition we build towards. The 2019 Champions League final was the last season the club was able to compete in more than one competition.
""We need to be able to compete in Europe and the cups. If you can compete, there is a chance you can be top.""
Frank's first shot at adding silverware will come in the Super Cup against Paris St-Germain on August 13. His first step into the dugout as Tottenham boss comes on Saturday, in a friendly at Reading.
Who will be his captain?
""I haven't decided anything on that. I have a long list of bullet points that I need to get through.
""[Heung-min Son] was captain last year and when we play two [teams for 45 minutes each vs Reading on Saturday], Son and [Cristian] Romero will be the two captains. That will be my decision.""
The futures of Son and Romero
""My expectation is that all the players are here. They are training well, I have been very impressed. They are playing [on Saturday] and that is a good indicator that they will be at the club.
""Two top players. Sonny has been here 10 years and finally got his deserved trophy. So important for the team and the club.
""Romero, a World Cup, Europa League and Copa America winner, very important for us.
""Both have trained well and set the standards. Both will play [vs Reading]. I am very happy.""
New signing Mohammed Kudus
""Great signing from the club. Top work from Daniel [Levy] and [Spurs technical director] Johan [Lange], getting a very good player in.
""He will give us some of that unpredictability in the game. His finishing is very good and he is almost at the perfect age to perform and to hit the next level.""
On transfer target Morgan Gibbs-White
""You know me well, I will not speak about players that are not mine. I will speak about the players who are inside the squad at Tottenham.""
The mood at the club since Ange Postecoglou's exit
""Ange will forever be a legend. He is one of three who have won a European trophy, a great achievement.
""I see happy players. Positive and smiling energy, training really well with a good vibe around the place.
""There should be a good vibe, they just won the Europa League title! Going into the new season, football is about dreaming and hoping.""
Sky Sports News' Gary Cotterill:
""The TF on his new Spurs training top said it all. It stands for Thomas Frank, of course. But it could also stand for Tottenham's Future. Certainly the team's immediate future is in his hands.
""He's super excited by the challenge. A challenge he's clearly ready for. And not concerned by the Tottenham Hotspur managerial merry-go-round. In fact, he seems ultra relaxed.
""Relaxed, for sure, in the press conference hot seat, despite him clearly understanding that Tottenham is a very different kettle of fish when it comes to media coverage. Say something wrong or controversial at Brentford and you might get away with it. A word out of place at Spurs and you won't. The world is watching.
""And that was the reason behind an obvious difference.
""The 40-minute news conference today was long enough and covered everything that needed covering.
""But it was shorter than many of his ordinary week-in, week-out news conferences at Brentford. That's because he was watching his Ps and Qs. His answers were shorter than when in west London. At times he stopped short of expanding a point. He played it safe. He was reserved.
""Despite that it was still a charm offensive. Thomas Frank is charming. He can't help it. Charming and excited. And he's enjoying the honeymoon period. A period he knows could be short-lived.
""If results and performances aren't up to scratch, honeymoon could quickly become divorce. In the time Frank was at Brentford, Spurs sacked five head coaches. Pochettino after a Champions League final. Mourinho just before a domestic cup final. Conte after securing a top-four place. Postecoglou after winning a trophy. The fifth, Nuno Espirito Santo only lasted four months.
""Frank has never been sacked. And has the air of a man who believes he can break the recent Spurs trend. He says 'Frankball' - his style of play at Tottenham Hotspur - will be aggressive and brave. He used the word brave several times, linking it to the club motto: To Do Is To Dare.
""He says he still needs to get to know most of the players personally. When he does, he'll decide who is best placed to play the way he wants.
""One of the things he's done with all those players so far is hold long-throw auditions. Part of his mission to improve set-pieces at the club. He wouldn't divulge who won the auditions to be in charge of long hauls into the box. But will Frank be in charge of Spurs for the long haul?
""The TF on his shirt suggests he's Tottenham's future. So, to be honest, did his demeanour.

It is understood City want to negotiate on the £40m buy-back clause they have on Trafford, who they sold to Burnley in 2023.
If Trafford were to leave Burnley they would be in the market for a new goalkeeper, and City stopper Stefan Ortega is one of a number they are currently looking at.
Newcastle had a bid of around £27m (inclusive of add-ons) turned down by Burnley in June.
Newcastle have signed forward Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest in a deal worth up to £55m, but look set to miss out on Hugo Ekitike, with the Eintracht Frankfurt striker preferring a move to Liverpool.
Their alternative target, Yoane Wissa, is highly unlikely to leave Brentford after Manchester United's latest bid for Bryan Mbeumo was accepted. The Magpies are currently focusing on recruiting defenders before addressing their attacking situation.

Arsenal complete £48.5m signing of Madueke from Chelsea,Arsenal complete the signing of England winger Noni Madueke from Chelsea for an initial fee of £48.5m.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg8j1l0751o,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 16:00:12",Adwaidh Rajan,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Arsenal have completed the signing of England winger Noni Madueke from Chelsea for an initial fee of £48.5m.
The 23-year-old was part of Chelsea's squad at the Club World Cup in the United States but left the camp before last Sunday's 3-0 win against Paris St-Germain in the final to finalise his move to Mikel Arteta's side.
Madueke has signed a five-year contract at Emirates Stadium, with his fee rising to just over £50m with add-ons.
""Humbled and blessed to be here. Thank you to everyone that made this possible,"" he wrote on Instagram.
""I can't wait to get on the pitch and start to repay the faith shown in me. It's going to be so special.""
He made 92 appearances for Chelsea after joining from PSV Eindhoven for £30m in January 2023 and scored 20 goals, helping them win the Conference League last season.
He was part of Crystal Palace and then Tottenham's academy before spending four-and-a-half years in the Netherlands, where he won the Dutch Cup.
Madueke made his England senior debut in August 2024 and set up Harry Kane's winner as Thomas Tuchel's side defeated Andorra 1-0 in World Cup qualification last month.
Arteta told Arsenal's website, external: ""Noni is an exciting and powerful young player, with his performances and numbers in recent seasons being of consistently high quality.
""He is one of the most talented wide forward players in the Premier League.
""At just 23, Noni already brings experience of club and international football, and he knows the Premier League very well.
""Having seen the quality of Noni's performances up close in recent seasons, we're really excited he is joining us. His arrival will really improve our squad.""
News of Arsenal's interest in the Chelsea winger had prompted a backlash from a section of the Gunners supporters earlier this month.
A petition, titled #NoToMadueke, was signed more than 5,000 times and murals outside the club's Emirates Stadium were vandalised with 'Arteta out'.
Madueke becomes Arsenal's fourth signing of the summer and second from Chelsea following the arrival of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
Midfielders Christian Norgaard from Brentford and Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad have also joined while the club are also close to signing striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting and Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera.
Where could Madueke play at Arsenal?
Madueke plays predominantly on the right, with 88% of his Premier League minutes having come on a side of the pitch that is dominated by Bukayo Saka at Arsenal.
Saka, 23, started 108 of 114 league matches from 2021-22 to 2023-24 but missed three months of last season because of a hamstring injury.
Madueke would be a capable option as back-up to Saka but can also play on the left.
He was one of England's standout performers in the recent international break and his assist from the left for Kane's winning goal against Andorra was one of three in his first seven matches for his country.
Madueke also started four of the Blues' final five Premier League matches of the season on that side - plus the Conference League final - and he could be direct competition for Gabriel Martinelli there.
How does he compare to Arsenal wingers?
You can see why Arteta might be excited about the prospect of signing Madueke.
His expected goals (9.6), his number of shots (80), touches in the opposition box (199) and progressive carries with the ball (242) were all higher than Martinelli and Saka in the Premier League last season.
Saka only played in 25 league matches compared to Madueke's 32, so it is a fairer comparison with Martinelli, who played 33 times.
Madueke also contributed a combined 10 goals and assists to Chelsea last season and could boost Arsenal's much-criticised attack.
Injuries plagued Arteta's side last season and they ended the season with limited options in the final third as they fell away in the title race.
Madueke is one of the most direct wingers in the league and Arsenal, who mainly play against teams who defend deep against them, could benefit from his eagerness to beat his defender and get a shot at goal.

Mbeumo 'proven quality' - but Man Utd still have striker dilemma,Bryan Mbeumo has joined Manchester United to boost their forward options but does Ruben Amorim still need to sign a striker?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ylzl4p227o,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:34:36",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"One of Manchester United's key priorities this summer was a search for goals.
Last season was United's worst in the Premier League era, and a key reason was the paltry 44 goals they scored - the average of 1.15 per game their lowest in a top-flight season since 1973-74.
Bryan Mbeumo's expected £65m move will take their guaranteed spending on attacking talent this summer to £127.5m, following the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.
But with both players expected to play in number 10 positions, do the club need a new central striker, or will Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee benefit from added firepower around them?
Chris Sutton, who won the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers, said: ""United's attack is clearly an area they need to improve. That's why they have gone for Mbeumo, because I think he is someone they feel they can trust in all areas, in possession and out of it, with the work-rate and energy - and goals too.
""Mbeumo is absolutely not cheap, but that is the going rate for a proven Premier League player.
""They want to bring in signings who are not development players but players who have been there and done it. Mbeumo is one of those. Cunha too.
""The question is do United still need another number nine? Because Rasmus Hojlund did not score enough last season.""
The end for Hojlund? Or a new opportunity?

By common consent, when United's troublesome Premier League campaign came to an end in May, the key failing that had to be addressed was their lack of goals.
Most assumed that meant a new number nine would be signed.
That United made a big play for Liam Delap - available for £30m from Ipswich - before he signed for Chelsea indicated key figures at Old Trafford felt the same.
Yet now, more than £120m later and with two new additions more at home behind a main forward rather than as one, questions are being asked about whether they will bring in a number nine or if - despite huge reservations - they stick with Hojlund.
The reasoning for the latter would be simple.
In order to fund more expensive recruitment, they need to generate more finance and - aside from sell-on clauses for Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Carreras - they have not managed it.
So a big offer for Aston Villa's England international Ollie Watkins is unlikely and, of the players available for nothing, the injury-hit Dominic Calvert-Lewin and veteran Jamie Vardy represent significant risk.
Though many thought they overpaid at the time, the recruitment team behind then manager Erik ten Hag felt it was worth signing off a £72m fee to bring in Hojlund from Italian club Atalanta.
At the time, Ten Hag said Hojlund had ""huge potential"" but he had ""to prove it"". So far, he has not done so.
He scored just four league goals all season, with understudy Zirkzee only managing three.
It has to be said, Hojlund's goals came from chances worth a measly 5.2 expected goals, showing the lack of opportunities he was being provided with - or making for himself.
Sutton said: ""Have United been providing him with the chances and the opportunities? The answer to that is no.
""But also, you have to consider whether he has done well enough. Has he ever been a prolific goalscorer? That would be the nagging doubt and is something I have debated with United fans.
""It is not to say he doesn't have time on his side, and his attitude is good too.""
But in a summer during which Carreras joined Real Madrid - fulfilling the promise many in the club's academy felt he had before they were overruled by Ten Hag and others who believed the full-back was not quick enough to excel at the highest level - are they ready to give up on Hojlund just yet?
The 22-year-old's contract does not expire until 2028. If they sold now, United wouldn't receive close to the sum they paid for him.
There are many unanswered questions at Old Trafford as the Premier League opener against Arsenal approaches.
Whether they should sign another number nine or stick with Hojlund and hope he flourishes alongside the likes of Cunha and Mbeumo is one of the most significant.
'Mbeumo will be expected to perform straight away'
Whatever the decision on United's striker dilemma, there can be little argument the addition of Mbeumo - alongside Cunha - strengthens their firepower.
Only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, Newcastle's Alexander Isak and Manchester City's Erling Haaland scored more than his 20 Premier League goals last season.
It was, though, the first time he has reached double figures for a top-flight club, and his expected goals (xG) statistic of 12.3 - which he outperformed by 7.7 goals - is something that would be difficult to repeat.
In the past five Premier League seasons, just 14 players have overperformed their xG by five goals or more.
Sutton said: ""He has done well at Brentford but playing for Manchester United is very different. With respect to Brentford, there is no great expectation there. At United, he will be expected to perform straight away.
""He has experience, he is a good finisher and his versatility is a big positive - he can play as a central striker as well as on the wing, cutting inside off the right on to his left foot.
""But he has had one very good season where his numbers were very good, so the question is whether he can repeat that.""
The Cameroon international is not being bought just for his goals, though.
Mbeumo prefers to play on the right behind a striker - with Cunha expected to feature on the left - but also has the versatility to play centrally, offering another solution to the striker problem.
He topped the list for touches per 90 minutes for players who scored more than 15 goals last season - showing his involvement in play - and ranks as one of the best ball carriers in the league, consistently with an effective end product.
He was 17th on the list of top assisters - with seven - but in expected assists he led the way in the Premier League with 9.3 xA.
Alongside Cunha's creativity, that can only be good news for whoever is chosen to play the central striker role.
""Consistency in those forward positions is what United are striving for, because they have not had it with, say, Alejandro Garnacho or Antony,"" said Sutton.
""They are maybe thinking an older, more experienced player, who is more reliable, is what they need. That's Mbeumo - he fits into Ruben Amorim's system and he fits the bill as proven Premier League quality too.
""Amorim wants a harmonious camp as well as a consistent performer, not someone who is a 3/10 one week and a 9/10 the next.
""That's what Manchester United have really been lacking and the numbers Mbeumo provided could be really important. That is the part of the jigsaw they have got to really solve if they want to be challenging at the top end of the table.""

'I've yet to be sacked' - Frank relishing 'risk' of taking Spurs job,"Tottenham manager Thomas Frank says he is in it ""for the long term,"" despite the club having four managers since June 2021.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2ezl2evmlko,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 17:21:17",Adam Millington,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Being Tottenham Hotspur manager has not recently aligned with job security, but new boss Thomas Frank is undaunted by recent history and says he is in it ""for the long term"".
Speaking in his first news conference since joining in June, Frank joked that, having never been sacked, he took the Spurs job to ""get a little bit more risk in his daily life"".
While Frank's tone was light-hearted, there is no doubting the demands of the role have proved difficult in the past four years.
Spurs have had four managers since June 2021, with Nuno Espirito Santo lasting just four months, Antonio Conte 16 months and Ange Postecoglou - despite ending the club's 17-year wait for a major trophy by winning the Europa League - two years.
""Coming to a big club, there are pressures,"" said the Dane. ""I like the ambitions and everything I do - every decision I've made - is for the long term. It's not about surviving 18 months, it's for the long run.""
The 51-year-old said it was ""extremely positive"" for the club to have lifted the Europa League last season and, while he wants to bring more trophies, his main ambition is to ensure Spurs are able to compete on all fronts.
""[Winning the Europa League] gave them that fantastic trophy that this club deserved and needed,"" he said.
""My aim is to add to that. The first aim is that we need to be able to compete in all four tournaments and do it consistently.""
Frank was speaking before Tottenham's first pre-season game against League One side Reading at 15:00 BST on Saturday.
Leaving Brentford 'very difficult' but right decision
Frank had been the Premier League's second longest-serving manager, leaving Brentford in June having managed them in the top flight since winning promotion in 2021.
He said it was a tough decision to leave the west London side, but managing Tottenham was an opportunity he could not refuse.
""In a way it was very difficult and in a way it was very easy,"" said Frank.
""It was very difficult because I'm a person that goes 'all in' in every relationship: work, friends, marriage, whatever it is. When you go all in and work at a football club, you get attached. I really loved my time there.
""I also felt maybe it was time to challenge myself and get another opportunity. When a club of Tottenham's magnitude are knocking on your door, I couldn't turn it down.""
Son and Romero 'very important'
Two immediate questions for Frank to address at Spurs are the futures of captain Son Heung-min - who has interest from Saudi Arabia - and Cristian Romero, who has been linked with a move this summer.
Frank, however, would not be drawn into a comment on what lies ahead for the pair and merely said Son and Romero are both ""very important"" for the club.
""Two top players, Sonny has been here 10 years and finally got his well-deserved trophy in the summer. So important for the team and the club,"" he said.
""Romero, World Cup winner, Europa League winner, Copa America winner, very important for us as well. Both have trained well and both will play on Saturday. I'm very happy.""
Frank was also tight-lipped over Tottenham's approach for Morgan Gibbs-White, that has led to Nottingham Forest considering legal action over whether a confidentiality agreement in the £60m release clause in his contract had been breached.
Frank said he will ""not speak about players who are not mine"".
'No definitive answer on Son and Romero' - analysis
It was more a case of what Frank didn't say when it came to the futures of skipper Son and vice-captain Romero than what he did say.
Both players were heroes of Spurs' euphoric Europa League win last season, but their futures are unclear heading into the new season.
Son, who has a year left on his deal, has been heavily linked with a move to Saudi Arabia, while BBC Sport has learned a number of MLS sides have registered an interest in the South Korea forward with a view to a potential January move.
Romero has been a long-term target for Atletico Madrid and his now seemingly annual flirtation with the Spanish side is again in full swing.
Neither look likely to leave before the club's pre-season tour of south-east Asia - particularly Son, who will be central to the club's commercial operations given his high profile status in the region.
But asked whether he was banking on the duo for next season, Frank fell short of providing a definitive answer.

Man Utd's unwanted five not in Stockholm squad but Cunha and Leon travel,"Manchester United's unwanted quintet will miss Saturday's pre-season fixture against Leeds United in Stockholm, but new signings Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon are in the squad.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgjge00xjvqo,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 14:11:28",Simon Stone,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United's unwanted quintet will miss Saturday's pre-season fixture against Leeds United in Stockholm, but new signings Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon have been included in the squad.
Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been told they can train at Carrington on Saturday as the search goes on to find them clubs.
The Leeds game is likely to see a debut for Cunha following his £62.5m signing from  Wolves.
With the exception of injured trio Joshua Zirkzee, Andre Onana and Lisandro Martinez, all United's senior players have travelled to Sweden to face Daniel Farke's newly promoted side.
Young defender Harry Amass will not be with them as he will go out on loan to further his development this season.
There are other youngsters involved though in Ruben Amorim's 29-man travelling party.
In addition to Leon, striker Chido Obi, defender Tyler Fredricson and midfielder Jack Fletcher, son of former United star and newly appointed under-18 coach Darren, are in the squad after being given new numbers earlier this week.
Godwill Kukonki, Sekou Kobe, Ethan Williams, Reece Munro and Bendito Mantato have also gone to Sweden.
United will travel to the United States on Tuesday for a three-match trip.
Bryan Mbeumo could join them on that tour after United had a £65m bid for the winger accepted by Brentford.
The Cameroon international could undergo a medical with the club before they fly to the US.
Manchester United squad for Stockholm trip
Goalkeepers: Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton, Dermot Mee
Defenders: Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Patrick Chinazaekpere Dorgu, Leny Yoro, Luke Shaw, Ayden Heaven, Diego Leon, Tyler Fredricson, Reece Munro, Godwill Kukonki
Midfielders: Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Jack Fletcher, Sekou Kone, Toby Collyer
Forwards: Rasmus Hojlund, Matheus Cunha, Amad, Chido Obi, Ethan Williams, Bendito Mantato
Amass set to leave on loan
Amass, 18, made seven first-team appearances last season, including four Premier League starts, after making his debut under Amorim in March.
He also played in both games on United's post-season tour of Asia, but will not travel with the squad to Sweden or the US.
Amass impressed many observers in the US last summer, when he caught the eye during pre-season, which included an encouraging display up against Liverpool's Mohamed Salah in South Carolina.
However, he was surprisingly overlooked by then-boss Erik ten Hag, who felt the youngster lacked the strength to make an impact in the Premier League even though his side were badly affected by injury on the left side of defence.
The arrival of Paraguay Under-20 international Leon earlier this month has increased competition for the role of back-up left-sided defender.
The decision has been taken internally at United for Amass to try to  get valuable experience by pushing to play first-team football every week, which would not have been the case had he remained at Old Trafford.
While Leon will be involved in the US tour, United do not view the Amass situation in a negative light and he remains highly thought of at the club.
It is understood there has been plenty of interest in the England youth international but no deal is imminent.

Man Utd agree £65m deal to sign Brentford's Mbeumo,Manchester United set to sign Bryan Mbeumo as Brentford accept £65m bid for Cameroon winger.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj4ekq5g5yyo,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:01:46",Sean Kearns,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United have had a £65m bid for Bryan Mbeumo accepted by Brentford.
The Cameroon international could undergo a medical with the club before Ruben Amorim's squad fly to the United States on Tuesday for their pre-season tour.
The 25-year-old winger is set to become United's third signing of the summer after the arrivals of forward Matheus Cunha and left-back Diego Leon.
United submitted their first bid - worth an overall £55m - at the start of June.
They failed with a second bid of £62.5m at the end of that month.
But the Bees are satisfied with United's latest offer, which is worth an initial £65m and could rise to £70m with £5m of add-ons.
Mbeumo, who joined the Bees in 2019 from Troyes, will become Brentford's biggest ever sale.
A player hitting his peak?
Mbeumo recorded career-best figures in the Premier League last season for virtually every attacking metric, including goals and assists, chances created and touches in the opposition box.
With a shot conversion rate of 23.53%, only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah and Newcastle United's Alexander Isak were more clinical in front of goal.
His work out of possession in key areas should also be noted. He won the ball back 32 times in the opposition third, ranking him third out of all Premier League players.
But perhaps Mbeumo's unique selling point is his running threat with the ball at his feet. He was responsible for nine carries of more than five metres which directly ended in a goal being scored in 2024-25 - comfortably the most of any Premier League player last season.
'Mbeumo will have to perform straightaway'
He has done well at Brentford, but playing for Manchester United is very different. With respect to Brentford, there is no great expectation there. At United, he will be expected to perform straightaway.
He has experience, he is a good finisher, and his versatility is a big positive - he can play as a central striker as well as on the wing, cutting inside off the right on to his left foot.
But he has had one very good season where his numbers were very good, so the question is whether he can repeat that.

United's attack is clearly an area they need to improve. People talk about how the way they play at the back, with the back three Amorim wants, and it is a difficult system to play at times when you are trying to press high because all your players have to work hard and be really switched on.
That's why he has gone for Mbeumo, because I think he is someone he feels he can trust in all areas, in possession and out of it, with the work-rate and energy he needs - and goals too.

Are Arsenal finally signing Viktor Gyökeres? It’s already real in the digital hive mind | Barney Ronay,"The Swedish striker has become more meme than man but he is the very good thing fans asked for, on a tray, ready to go",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/19/arsenal-viktor-gyokeres-already-real-digital-hive-mind,"Sat, 19 Jul 2025 07:00:15",Barney Ronay,['Arsenal'],"The current edition of France Football magazine has a photo of Viktor Gyökeres on the cover. Not that I’ve looked at it much, or pored over its details searching for meaning, but the photo shows Gyökeres half in shade, half in sun, displaying his famously shredded physique, not so much the standard male musculature, more a selection of lines and bulges, like he’s made entirely from giant walnuts, like a perfect human challah loaf designed by a robot.
In the photo Gyökeres is smiling with a kind of fervour, as though he’s about to sell you a miracle muscle powder. And I for one would buy this powder. Make me into a cyborg, Viktor. Maximise my hidden hyper-potential. Basically, I want Viktor Gyökeres to hold me brusquely in his arms while he talks about good proteins and explains the blockchain, in a way that isn’t sexual. Not for me anyway, but that definitely is for him.
There is also, and you’ve probably seen this – I for one have barely noticed it – a breathlessly excited Viktor Gyökeres profile in the June/July issue of Vogue Scandinavia, which has him posing by his pool in biscuit-coloured linens looking like an incredibly handsome psychopath. And yes, the profile talks about “piercing eyes” and “muscles stretching away at his white T-shirt”, but it’s not salacious or cheap because Gyökeres is also “a complex and multifaceted individual”, whose PlayStation-pad football house is in fact alluring, soulful and “a byproduct of transience”. Yes Viktor Gyökeres. Let me rescue you. I will make you a home. I will bake for you.
To what extent does a thing still have to happen for it to be classed as real? This feels like a key question right now, not just in football, where everything is simultaneously happening and has already happened, but in life generally, the final battle between the fake and the real, a question that must be broken down into ever more granular questions. What is “real”? What is “happening”? What is “Viktor Gyökeres”?
Despite the evidence above of rigorous journalistic research, I don’t really know much about Gyökeres beyond the stuff everyone knows. I have no great interest in whether he signs for Arsenal or not until he actually does, at which point he will become just another guy in an ever-shifting cast of guys, something real that now has to actually happen. Reality can wait, though. We aren’t there yet. We are instead still drifting along in the endless summer of Gyökeres, witnesses to a yearning that feels like art, and that is in many ways better than actual football.
We know this process now. It is necessary to fight it every summer. Don’t get sucked in. Look away from the churn. This one, however, feels like a step up. It has been two months of hive-mind longing over on GyökeresHereWeGoX, a place where details, comments, images bubble up and surge, overwhelm the senses, then disappear like summer storms.
This seemed to have peaked on Thursday with EXCLUSIVE news that there would that same day be an EXCLUSIVE prefiguring the actual EXCLUSIVE, a here we go for the here we go for the here we actually go. Footage appeared of a house (is it a house?) that allegedly shows Gyökeres (is it him?) moving out his furniture (is it furniture?). Later, there was talk of a plane leaving Stockholm bound for Biggin Hill airport, complete with detailed flightpath screenshots, which was then rubbished by a secondary cohort of Biggin Hill truthers. Wait! His brother has followed Arsenal on Instagram! A medical is booked for Friday, even if there is no evidence of this, just talk about talk of a presumed medical on a hypothetical Friday.
This has become a little over-ripe by now, a descent into 450-word long posts about the stock exchange, financial gaming and announcement-delay. Gyökeres himself has long since become more meme than man. Is it a joke? Is this all post-irony? If a plane takes off and nobody knows if Victor Gyökeres is on it, but excitement at the idea Victor Gyökeres may be on it feels real, is Victor Gyökeres actually inside the plane?.
It would be easy here to dismiss this phenomenon, to see evidence of the idiot-trajectory of the human race, of content addiction, of the fact big Euro-football must never not be happening. But this is also a supremely well‑curated media industry now, fed by the great transfluencers of our time, Fab, Orny, the other ones.
It is also a kind of mass social experiment. Psychologists like to talk about the Anticipation Effect, the principle that anticipation of an event can release more dopamine to the brain than the actual experience. Having Gyökeres in your team is good. Talking about Gyökeres, visualising this, war-gaming it, making it real in the digital mind: this is a life choice, something to make your blood move, like jabbing a fork into your kneecap just so you get to feel something.
The emotions here are nuanced. Studies show anticipation also generates anxiety, to the extent it can overshadow the event itself, or make it feel like it has already happened. There are people out there who seem genuinely convinced Gyökeres is already not just a failure but a proven fraud.
I can recite by heart the ratio of Portuguese league goals against teams in the bottom four (43.6%). Never mind the fact this always happens because those teams are worse, or that Erling Haaland, for example, has built a career around stamping on ants. Or that I am being sucked in here in real time, arguing over things that haven’t happened but still kind of have, like the whole thing is a super-smart Andy Warhol installation called Goal Abs or Nothing Is True.
There are reasons why this one feels more significant. There are good human subplots. Can you make the leap up? Can a career that turned on a 17-goal season in the Championship become elite at this late stage? Gyökeres has been wrapped in a convincing origins story. There are Proustian elements, some talk in France Football of a sensory reconnection with the childhood lust for goals, the clank of the stanchion, the need to “start playing again like I did when I was a child”.
Gyökeres is also perfect for the internet. He’s not into feelings. He’s into the body. We know about his magic super-breakfast, the ginger shot, the strawberries, blueberries and pomegranates, plus three – not two, not four – eggs. He seems to be pitching himself as real, analogue, anti-academy. Gyökeres says he stayed at IFK Aspudden-Tellus so long because “it built me differently from others”, and I for one can already hear him saying this on a seven-hour Joe Rogan podcast.
The spell at Brighton is dismissed as not “a good environment”. A return to the Premier League would be a chance for “revenge”. Arsenal host Graham Potter’s West Ham in October. We’re talking about revenge. We’re self third-personing (“You haven’t seen the best of Gyökeres yet”). Is he as good as Kane, Lewandowski, Haaland? “It’s difficult to rank me, but yes, I’m at the same table as them.” How could you not want to see this?
There are also two football things that make it interesting. First, this is the perfect what-if transfer. It’s beautifully linear. It’s 2+2. Saying Arsenal need a striker has gone on for so long it has become a kind of mass lament, a bardic cycle. The current candidates are Gabriel Jesus, an almost guy, and Kai Havertz who is good but also looks like the foppish minor cousin a Jane Austen heroine is required to fall in love with before the arrival of handsome, brooding Mr Lordly of Lord Hall.
Well, now you get to sign a 27-year-old goal-maniac whose nicknames are The Machine, The Cyborg, The Viking, The Cannibal and The Tractor. This is simply the thing you asked for, on a tray, ready to go. Here is a very good No 9 with zero reasons not to succeed, who will probably do so because a stage has been built, and because of the evidence of hard numbers, which are all that really matter in this dynamic. The other thing here is closure. If Gyökeres does sign for Arsenal this will inevitably become a referendum on the Mikel Arteta era, which has become mired in a very annoying discussion about actual success. Is second good? Is this progress?
Whatever you think of Arteta’s cinematic passion, the Lego figure on the heath pointing at the skies dynamic, it is undeniably real, undeniably a quest for victory. There will be a crunch point here. There have already been rumblings. The Thomas Partey saga was weird, unsavoury and remains a potential timebomb. Now you have your Martín Zubimendi. You have the muscle-goal athlete, the finisher. Addition and success. Or limitations pinned and wriggling on the wall.
For now we have the longest day, a here-we-go waiting to happen. Do I dare to scroll? Or can we linger a little longer, remain in that dream state, half in sun, half in shade, muscles perfectly sculpted, all promise, all what-next, before being dragged out into the light?

Thomas Frank hints it may be goodbye to Tottenham for Son Heung-min,No guarantees from new manager over captain staying,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/thomas-frank-hints-it-may-be-goodbye-to-tottenham-for-son-heung-min,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 21:30:02",David Hytner,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Thomas Frank has said he is yet to decide whether to keep Son Heung-min as his captain at Tottenham and the new manager did not offer any guarantees that the club’s marquee player would stay beyond the closure of the summer transfer window.
Frank addressed a host of subjects at his official presentation on Friday before his first Spurs game – the friendly at Reading on Saturday – taking in his targets, how he intends to play and the desire to guard against the level of injuries that undermined his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou. He revealed that Dejan Kulusevski, who underwent knee surgery on 14 May, would not be available for the start of the season.
Frank was typically friendly, if a little nervous; the packed media auditorium was a far cry from what he was used to during his seven years at his previous club, Brentford. He appeared determined to keep his cards close to his chest, to sidestep the tricky questions but his wish to live in the moment and not look too far ahead did little to convince on Son.
The 33-year-old Son, who led Spurs to Europa League glory last season – his first silverware in 10 years at the club – has 12 months on his contract. There has been no indication that Son is ready to agree to fresh terms and the chair, Daniel Levy, would surely hate to lose him as a free agent.
“Good question,” Frank said, when pressed on whether Son would remain captain. “I haven’t decided anything on that. I have a long list of bullet points I need to get through and I take them in the right order.”
Frank said that Son would captain the team for one half of the Reading game, with Cristian Romero, one of the vice-captains from last season, wearing the armband for the other half. Romero has been tracked by Atlético Madrid, although there are doubts as to whether the Spanish club would be able to make a compelling offer for him, which would need to be at least £60m.
Frank was asked whether Son had earned the right to decide his own future. “It’s always tricky, situations like that … if that happens,” Frank said. “Right now I have a player that is fully committed and training well and will play tomorrow. If a player has been at a club a long time, then there will always be a decision for the club to take.
“Because there is something in it if someone wants to leave at a certain stage … then there can be something there. But the club will always decide in the end. First and foremost, he’s here now. I’m not worried too much about it. Let’s take that five or six weeks down the line. That will probably [be a question] I get the following week, so I’ll practise my answers. Right now, he’s here.”
Frank fell back on more than one occasion on three buzz words: he wants his team to be brave, aggressive and attacking. And while he agreed with Levy’s assertion that the ambition had to be to win the Premier League and Champions League, Frank made clear that the most pressing goal was to be competitive in all four competitions – including the Champions League, to which Spurs have won a return.
“What are the odds for us winning the Premier League this season?” he said. “I think we’re probably not the favourites. There are probably three teams at least ahead of us but we will do what we can to build a strong and competitive team.
“The first aim is that we need to be able to compete in all four tournaments and do it on a consistent level. I think 2019 was the last season where the club managed to compete in more than one competition. If we can compete, there’s maybe a chance that you can hopefully end top. But we need to be able to build to compete first.”
On the hot topic of fitness, Frank acknowledged the remorselessness of the schedule. But he said: “Hopefully the way we train, building layers, building robustness into the players, is going to be a big part and making the players more available through the season. Hopefully we can make good decisions, with feeling, with knowledge, with numbers, [about] when to rotate and when to rest. It’s a big thing as well.”
Frank joked he made his “first rookie mistake” when he mentioned Arsenal and their Invincible season – “the team that we can’t mention [at this club]”. He did so in the context of an answer in which he said it was “100% sure” Spurs would lose league matches because virtually everybody did – apart from you know who. It was part of his overall expectation management sweep.
Frank also got a few smiles when he considered how Spurs had sacked five managers in the time that he spent at Brentford. “Only five?” he said. “I like to challenge myself. I have the privilege that I have never been sacked before. That is one of the reasons why I took the job. I get a little bit more risk in my daily life.”
The bottom line is that Frank will be under pressure, partly because he is succeeding a trophy-winning manager, who some of the fans did not want to see go; partly because of the talent in the squad, which will be supplemented during the transfer window. Frank made no comment on the ongoing pursuit of the £60m-rated Nottingham Forest midfielder, Morgan Gibbs-White.
“It’s the easy part now – the honeymoon,” Frank said. “Everyone is happy, the sun is shining, we haven’t played a game yet. I think the honeymoon is five, six weeks of pre-season. Then it’s reality, no matter if we won [a trophy] last season or not. So, five, six weeks where you can do a lot of good stuff and then it’s reality. I look forward to that.”

Manchester United agree deal to buy Bryan Mbeumo for initial £65m,Fee for forward could reach £71m with add-ons,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/manchester-united-agree-deal-bryan-mbeumo-brentford-initial-65m,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:09:58",Will Unwin,"['Manchester United', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","Manchester United have agreed a deal worth more than £70m to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. A fee of £65m will be paid up front and a further £6m could follow in add-ons.
The Cameroonian, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, has been a key target for Ruben Amorim. United first made an offer for Mbeumo six weeks ago and had a number of bids rejected. Mbeumo made clear he wanted to move to Old Trafford despite interest at Tottenham from his former head coach Thomas Frank, and personal terms are not thought to be an issue.
Mbeumo is in line to become United’s third signing of the summer after the Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha, who cost £62.5m from Wolves, and the Paraguayan full-back Diego León. Mbeumo is likely to be used by Amorim in one of the two No 10 spots in a 3-4-3 formation. United are also eager to sign a striker and maintain an interest in Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson.
Mbeumo is due to join United’s tour to the United States, which starts next week, allowing time for the 25-year-old to integrate and understand Amorim’s demands and style.
The fee is an impressive profit for Brentford, who signed Mbeumo from Troyes in 2019 for £5.8m. He spent two seasons in the Championship before winning promotion and scoring 42 goals in 136 Premier League appearances.
Considering the summer’s outlays, United will want to secure fees for five players who are not part of Amorim’s plans. Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia want to leave and the club have allowed them time away from training to seek exits.

Noni Madueke will be unfazed by new Arsenal challenge and fans’ scepticism,"Mikel Arteta’s latest signing from Chelsea is a driven individual, confident in his ability, according to his fitness coach",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/noni-madueke-arsenal-challenge-fans-scepticism-chelsea,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 16:11:51",Ed Aarons,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","If Noni Madueke finds time to head to Marbella for his annual personal pre-season training camp this summer, you probably won’t find Arsenal’s new signing frequenting any of the Spanish seaside city’s glamorous hangouts. “His peers are all partying – they’re at the beach clubs and stuff like that,” says the winger’s individual skills coach, Saul Isaksson-Hurst. “But he’s turning up every day. Even I’m telling him: ‘You need one rest day, a couple of days.’ But Noni is so driven. He understands the importance of working hard – the more you put in, the more you get out. The reality is that he wants to do more.”
Madueke was spotted letting his hair down with Jadon Sancho at the Wireless festival in north London’s Finsbury Park last weekend, which was understandable given the week he had. Having been used sparingly by Enzo Maresca during Chelsea’s first five games at the Club World Cup, the 23-year-old flew back from the US last Friday, before the final, after an agreement was struck for him to become the sixth player Mikel Arteta has signed from Stamford Bridge since the Spaniard became the Arsenal manager in late 2019. Kepa Arrizabalaga trod the same path at the start of this month.
Of the previous four arrivals from Chelsea, perhaps only Kai Havertz can be described as having been a success. Willian, Jorginho and Raheem Sterling – who endured a disappointing loan spell last season – largely failed to impress. That may explain the opprobrium from some Arsenal fans that greeted news of Madueke’s impending switch. Supporters even launched a petition entitled #NOTOMADUEKE, though that had struggled past the 5,000 mark by the time the transfer was confirmed on Friday. Madueke, who has signed a five-year contract, is understood to have cost £48.5m plus up to £3.5m in bonuses.
According to Isaksson-Hurst, who first met Madueke when the player had just broken into PSV’s first team as a teenager, the noise is unlikely to have an impact on someone he describes as a “mentality monster”.
“Noni is very single-minded – he knows his quality,” he says. “Anyone who’s involved in football and development particularly knows what a talent he is. He’s still a young player and his potential is limitless. He’s one of the most exciting young attacking wide players in Europe. I don’t think it bothers him. [Criticism] is part and parcel of the sport, unfortunately – it’s water off a duck’s back.”
The speed that Madueke fell out of favour at Stamford Bridge is understood to have surprised many in his camp, especially after he made his England debut last year. He scored the first senior hat-trick of his career against Wolves in August but managed only another four goals in the Premier League from a further 26 starts.
With the signings Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens, Estêvão and João Pedro adding to Maresca’s attacking options, Madueke sensed his opportunities would be limited and was understood to have been keen to join Arsenal, where Arteta is hoping he will provide much-needed cover for Bukayo Saka on the right and push Gabriel Martinelli to start on the left. “It’s difficult – he wants to play like any young player,” says Isaksson-Hurst. “He needs to go somewhere where he’s appreciated and he’s playing regularly.”
Joining a new London club will be nothing new for Madueke. He was spotted by Crystal Palace when he was nine and travelled across the capital from the family home in Barnet for three years. His father, Ify, who also acts as his agent and invested in a pedigree race horse called Princess Chizara that competed at Ascot in 2023, is said to have been relieved when Tottenham snapped up Madueke in 2014 given the shorter journey that also allowed his son to attend the prestigious St Columba’s college private school in St Albans.
Madueke rejected an offer from Manchester United at 16 after starring for England at various youth levels and then turned his back on English football by moving to the Netherlands and PSV in June 2018. Sancho had swapped Manchester City for Borussia Dortmund the previous summer.
“That’s a big, bold move going abroad when you’re that age,” says Isaksson-Hurst. “Noni went there because he knew that like a lot of the young guys who go abroad now, they have more chances of playing first-team football. And he had several opportunities to come back earlier [than when he joined Chelsea in January 2023], but he just wanted to stay because he wanted to make sure he was playing. All the decisions he’s made are based on progressing and doing what’s best for him and his career, and being brave and always working outside of his comfort zone and doing it. Wherever he goes, he’ll be successful.”

Football Daily | England and Sweden get into spot of bother with an unmissable shootout,Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/football-daily-email-england-sweden-penalties,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 13:55:53",Michael Butler,"['Arsenal', 'Liverpool']","PAYING THE PENALTY
The strongest contender that Football Daily could find for the worst penalty shootout of all time was predictably held between two English teams. In January 1998, under-10 pair Mickleover Lightning Blue Sox and Chellaston Boys faced off in the Derby Community Cup. After the regular game finished 1-1, a total of 56 penalties failed to break the deadlock, with referee Peter Shieff even moving the spot two yards closer and offering a coin toss to decide the result (which the sides declined). Despite saving 31 consecutive spot-kicks in the sudden-death decider, Chellaston Boys’ goalkeeper Ben Hodder ended up on the losing side as Blue Sox romped home 2-1, after a grand total of 66 kicks had been taken, a world record verified by David Barber, the FA’s official statistician. A thought, then, for the parents that day 27 years ago, stood on the sidelines, outwardly encouraging their youngsters while internally being tortured and scorched with the fires of a thousand flamethrowers.
A similar feeling engulfed England and Sweden on Thursday night: after an abysmal first half left them 2-0 down, the Lionesses mounted a late comeback for the ages to force extra-time and penalties. Twice in the subsequent shootout Sweden had kicks to win the game but twice they came up short, with England somehow prevailing 3-2. Before we properly get into the drama – and oh, we will – it should be said that the actual game was as dramatic as it was full of quality. Sweden’s front two of Kosovare Asllani and Stina Blackstenius were outstanding and took their goals expertly. England’s Lauren James was moving like Zizou in the No 10 role – Football Daily hasn’t seen a roulette that devastating since our last trip to Las Vegas. Chloe Kelly’s wingplay was game-changing, providing both assists as England clawed their way back into the game.
Unfortunately the same could not be said for the shootout, as nerves, fatigue and excellent goalkeeping from both England’s Hannah Hampton and Sweden’s Jennifer Falk ensured that just five of the 14 penalties found the net. Ultimately, it was the brilliant and bloodied Hampton, along with Lucy Bronze – who scored England’s first goal, soldiered on with knack through extra time and smashed home the decisive penalty – who were England’s heroes. “Lucy Bronze is just one of a kind, I have never, ever seen this before in my life,” roared England manager Sarina Wiegman afterwards. “What defines her is that resilience, that fight. I think the only way to get her off the pitch is in a wheelchair.”
Fair play to England then, who – against all odds – found a way to win, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. As for those penalties, plenty of elite performers have failed to convert at major tournaments, from Roberto Baggio to Bukayo Saka to Diana Ross, and there is plenty of time now to practise before Tuesday’s semi-final against Italy. Leah Williamson succinctly summed up how most were feeling as the dust settled on England’s win, in a quote that could easily have also come from a Derbyshire-based parent in 1998: “That was awful to watch at the end. [Penalties] are the easiest and the hardest thing in the world.” Amen to that.

QUOTE OF THE DAY
There is such a feeling of sadness and disbelief around this awful tragedy that we wanted to make this tribute of our own as soon as we could. Like everyone else, we’ve been stunned by events, and we remember what a wonderful player Diogo was for Wolves during that unforgettable promotion season under Nuno and our early years back in the Premier League. His record of 44 goals at Wolves, and then 65 at Liverpool as a Premier League title winner, speaks volumes. So many fans across the game – especially in Portugal after he helped them win the Nations League this summer – are feeling his loss deeply. We saw no reason to delay this decision” – Wolves induct Diogo Jota into their hall of fame.

The north (in the west) starts at the Cheshire/Staffordshire border. This puts Stoke in the midlands (yesterday’s Football Daily letters) and Crewe in the north. This isn’t just my opinion (I went to grammar school in Crewe) but also the opinion of a person originally from Merseyside who wrote a book about the north that started by him defining where the north started and the first chapter was him visiting Crewe” – Mike Walsh.
Looking at the James, Parker, Chapman, Jack golfing quartet (yesterday’s Memory Lane, full email edition), I couldn’t help but wonder which one of them would have the flag showing ‘Fashion, Golf, Arsenal. In that order’” – Ken Muir.
Further to Yannick Woudstra (yesterday’s letters) wondering if a move to Old Trafford could materialise for Jordan Henderson. I seem to recall that Alex Ferguson once put the kibosh on a move for Henderson in the early-2000s over concerns about his running style. Well the good news for Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s brains trust is that, at the age of 35, running won’t be something Henderson will be doing a lot of. Sign him up!” – Joel Flood.

Football transfer rumours: West Ham and Everton move for Jack Grealish?,Today’s rumours were up all night,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/18/football-transfer-rumours-west-ham-everton-jack-grealish-victor-osimhen,"Fri, 18 Jul 2025 08:44:19",Michael Butler,"['Arsenal', 'Liverpool', 'Manchester City']","Given Victor Osimhen is one of the world’s best No 9s, definitely available for transfer and with a £64m release clause is a cheaper option than both Viktor Gyökeres (who is older) and Hugo Ekitike (who is relatively unproven), it seems a little bit wild that Arsenal, Liverpool or any other elite European team are not in for the Nigerian striker. Having impressed last season on loan at Galatasaray, winning the Golden Boot in Turkey on the way to a Süper Lig title, Osimhen could complete a remarkable permanent move to Istanbul in lieu of any other interest. Napoli are happy to sell, given Osimhen has one year remaining on his contract, but have reportedly inserted a clause preventing the striker from joining Juventus at a later date.
Like a sophisticated nuclear submarine patiently lying in wait or just a middle-aged man trying to get out of a bathtub, West Ham have emerged as a potential loan destination for Jack Grealish. The Manchester City winger’s gargantuan wages are too dear for a permanent move but a loan deal may suit and the Mill is wholeheartedly in favour of the deal, mainly because Grealish and West Ham mascot Danny Dyer will undoubtedly be thrown together in the name of #content. Everton could yet scupper the Englishman’s move to east London, offering Grealish a chance to stay in the north-west.
Speaking of West Ham, Aaron Wan-Bissaka was crowned last season’s Hammer of the Year for his performances at right back, so naturally West Ham are targeting … another right-back! In fairness, Kyle Walker-Peters will be relatively cheap after becoming a free agent, so the east Londoners will just have to stump up for inflated wages and a large signing-on bonus that is the norm with free transfers these days. West Ham have swooped after his provisional move to Besiktas was cancelled and the Turkish club released a curt statement: “It is publicly known that the arrival of professional football player Kyle Walker-Peters, with whom we previously announced an agreement in principle and invited him to Istanbul for a medical examination, has been postponed. Kyle Walker-Peters notified us, requesting an extension. Consequently, our club has withdrawn its transfer.”
One Englishman that has made his way to Besiktas is Tammy Abraham, with the former Chelsea striker confirming the loan move earlier this month. That leaves a Tammy Abraham-sized hole at his parent club, Roma, which may now be filled with the loan signing of Brighton’s Evan Ferguson. The Irishman failed to find the net in any of his eight appearances last season on loan at West Ham but there’s a good player in there somewhere and the Italian capital is not a bad place to find one’s form.
Hold the back page! Arsenal have signed a striker! Alas, it is not an expensive and moody Swede playing in Portugal (yet), but Salford City’s 17-year-old Will Wright, who is expected to cost around £250,000 after 50 goals across all age groups. Liverpool were also reportedly interested but failed to match Arsenal’s bid.
In the not-too-distant past, Gio Reyna was The Next Big Thing for Borussia Dortmund and the USMNT. Now, the 22-year-old is on the verge of a £5.5m move to American-backed Serie A side Parma, who are now managed by 29-year-old Carlos Cuesta, one of Mikel Arteta’s former coaches at Arsenal.
And Florian Wirtz’s dad has credited Arne Slot as the reason his son chose Liverpool over Bayern Munich. “Arne Slot presented his playing philosophy, the team tactics in possession and pressing, and how Florian can develop his strengths in these areas,” Hans Wirtz told Der Spiegel. “This made a decisive impression on Florian. The training conditions in Liverpool were also totally impressive.”
