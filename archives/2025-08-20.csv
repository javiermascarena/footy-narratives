'The relationship can't continue' - Isak goes public on Newcastle future,"Liverpool target Alexander Isak says his relationship with Newcastle ""can't continue"" and ""change is in the best interests of everyone"" as he accused the club of broken promises over his future.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13414831/alexander-isak-transfer-news-liverpool-target-breaks-silence-to-declare-he-cant-continue-at-newcastle,"Tue, 19 Aug 2025 20:46:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool target Alexander Isak says his relationship with Newcastle ""can't continue"" and ""change is in the best interests of everyone"" as he accused the club of broken promises over his future.
Hours after the striker delivered his bombshell statement, Newcastle responded by refuting Isak's suggestion he was told he could leave this summer and insisted they ""do not foresee"" the player being sold, as their terms are unlikely to be met.
Isak's potential sale has always been dependent on Newcastle signing an adequate replacement and a club meeting their £150m valuation. With less than two weeks left in the window, neither of those conditions have been met.
Isak, 25, is currently training away from his team-mates, but Newcastle added: ""Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his team-mates.""
Isak's explosive statement said: ""I've kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn't reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors.
""The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading.
""When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue. That's where things are for me right now - and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself.""
Newcastle's statement in response read: ""We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views.
""As explained to Alex and his representatives, we must always take into consideration the best interests of Newcastle United, the team and our supporters in all decisions and we have been clear that the conditions of a sale this summer have not transpired.
""We do not foresee those conditions being met.
""This is a proud football club with proud traditions and we strive to retain our family feel. Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his teammates.""
Sky Sports News reported in July that Isak had informed Newcastle he wanted to explore his options this transfer window.
At the start of August, Liverpool had a £110m plus add-ons bid rejected by Newcastle for the 25-year-old.
Isak took his frustrations public on Tuesday with an update on Instagram posted during the PFA awards ceremony, which he skipped despite being nominated for the top prize of Player of the Year, due to his current stand-off with Newcastle.
He said: ""I'm proud to be recognised by my fellow professionals with a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Season for 2024/25.
""First and foremost I want to thank my teammates and everyone at Newcastle United who has supported me along the way.
""I'm not at the ceremony tonight. With everything going on, it didn't feel right to be there.""
Newcastle have so far failed to bring in a striker to cover the loss of Callum Wilson let alone Isak.
They have been unsuccessful this summer with attempts to sign Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko - both of whom were considered potential successors to Isak - and have very limited options with less than two weeks left of the window.
Newcastle had a £25m bid rejected for Yoane Wissa earlier in the window, but that deal is at a standstill while Brentford searching for a replacement of their own.
Wissa is viewed by Newcastle as a second-choice striker and his potential arrival would likely not help Isak get his move.
Other than Isak, Newcastle currently only have one recognised striker on their books in 22-year-old William Osula, who did not start a single Premier League game for the club last season.
Sky Sports News' Keith Downie:
""Newcastle are stressing here that they have been unable to find a suitable replacement for Alexander Isak, coupled by Liverpool's opening bid falling significantly below the striker's valuation.
""Had Newcastle managed to sign Hugo Ekitike or Benjamin Sesko, who joined Liverpool and Manchester United respectively, then in all likelihood the club would have reluctantly sold Isak to Liverpool with an increased bid from the Premier League champions.
""Newcastle have tried hard to facilitate and give Isak his wish, but they cannot leave themselves without a recognised striker.
""Unless something out of the blue comes up between now and the window closing on September 1, it appears Isak will be staying. If and when he plays again is another story…""
July 15: Liverpool told Isak not for sale in this window after making informal approach to Newcastle - and decide to rival them for Hugo Ekitike instead after being rebuffed.
July 19: Eddie Howe reveals after pre-season friendly defeat at Celtic that Isak travelled with the rest of the squad to Glasgow but he chose to send him home ""due to the speculation around him"".
July 23: Liverpool beat Newcastle to the signing of Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt after the North East club had already missed out on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro.
July 24: Isak is not included in Newcastle's squad for pre-season tour of Asia due to what Newcastle described as a ""minor thigh injury"".
July 24: It later emerges that Isak has informed Newcastle he wants to explore his options in this transfer window.
July 31: Sky Sports News reports that Isak is training individually at former club Real Sociedad's facilities.
August 1: Newcastle reject an official bid from Liverpool for Isak worth £110m plus add-ons.
August 2: Newcastle make formal bid to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko worth nearly £70m and Isak later flies back to the North East after his personal training camp in Spain.
August 4: The striker returns to Newcastle's training ground for the first time and has trained separately from his team-mates ever since.
August 4: Newcastle up their offer to RB Leipzig for Sesko amid interest from Manchester United.
August 8: Newcastle boss Eddie Howe says ""we would love the player to be with us"" about Isak after he misses friendly win over Espanyol at St James' Park.
August 9: Manchester United beat Newcastle to the signing of Sesko despite their offer to RB Leipzig being lower.
August 16: Isak not included in Newcastle squad for Premier League season opener against Aston Villa - but Howe says ""door is well and truly open"" for a return.
August 19: Isak skips PFA awards and releases a statement on Instagram accusing Newcastle of broken promises, telling the club ""change is in the best interests of everyone"".
August 19: Newcastle release a statement in response to Isak, denying that promises were made to allow Isak to leave and insisting they would welcome him back when he is ""ready to rejoin his team-mates""
Sky Sports' Jamie Carragher speaking last week:
""I don't like the way he's going about it, and I don't think any football fan should.
""There is nothing wrong with wanting to leave a club, that's the nature of the game, players leave clubs every summer, but you work as hard as you can and play the games. You can say you want to leave, I understand the player's frustration and a bit of bitterness because of the money on offer, but I don't think you can get to the stage where you don't train.
""I'm not that fussed on Liverpool signing him. He's better than (Hugo) Ekitike right now. But it almost feels like what PSG or Real Madrid tried to do a few years ago, whereby they try to sign all the best players available. Liverpool don't do that. There are other areas Liverpool should use that money.""
Sky Sports' Gary Neville speaking last week:
""Isak should be angry with his agent. It's unsavoury.
""I feel sorry for Eddie Howe. Isak wants to win trophies and is agitating for a move because he's got one career. I can see both sides. He's got five or six good years left.
""It looks like this guy is downing tools and saying he's not playing, and I don't think that is right.
""Newcastle have to stand strong here. If you're the club, it sends the wrong message to sell after what has happened.
""I think they have to keep him for another year because the precedent will be dangerous for Newcastle.""

Merson says: Advantage Arsenal after 'vital' win but Man City's performance a warning,"Paul Merson gives his verdict on the opening weekend of the season, including a ""vital"" win for Arsenal at Man Utd and Man City's ""impressive"" rout of Wolves.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13414548/paul-merson-says-advantage-arsenal-after-vital-win-but-man-citys-performance-a-warning,"Tue, 19 Aug 2025 12:20:00",Paul Merson,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United', 'Manchester City']","Paul Merson gives his verdict on the opening weekend of the season, including a ""vital"" win for Arsenal at Man Utd and Man City's ""impressive"" rout of Wolves.
In his exclusive column for skysports.com, the Magic Man also gives his thoughts on United's goalkeeper issues, Tottenham's start under Thomas Frank and Chelsea's lack of cutting edge in front of goal...
The name of the game is winning.
Old Trafford is a difficult place to go, especially on the opening weekend, but Arsenal found a way to win.
They will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.
It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.
But advantage Arsenal. The way I see it now is Liverpool and Man City have to go to Old Trafford to win to match Arsenal, and that's a huge positive at such an early stage of the season.
Special mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.
There were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.
If he can maintain those levels that is a big plus for Arsenal.
No-one has really even mentioned Man City in the build up to the season.
It's like no-one knew what to expect from Pep Guardiola and his side, but they really impressed me. It's like we forgot how good they can be because of how bad they were last season. People are starting to take notice now, however.
The win at Wolves was a warning to the other sides wanting to win the title.
I know it wasn't the hardest game in Wolves, but winning away from home 4-0 on the opening day of the Premier League is no mean feat.
It was the result of the weekend for me because no-one on Soccer Saturday mentioned them as title winners. Everyone is on Liverpool or Arsenal but the performance from City was a wake-up call for everyone.
There will be bigger tests to come for them, that's for sure, starting on Saturday against Spurs, but they were very impressive.
It is rare in football that a club wins a league title, a Champions League, a Euros or a World Cup without a solid goalkeeper.
You have to have a good goalkeeper because they save you points. David Raya won Arsenal points on Sunday, Alisson Becker does it continually for Liverpool and Ederson has done it through the years at Man City.
Altay Bayindir has lost Man Utd points already with that error against Arsenal. It was a big mistake, a critical mistake in the end.
I can't emphasise how important a top goalkeeper is to a football club and Man Utd have to now react before the transfer window closes.
Apart from that error, Man Utd did alright against Arsenal.
I was impressed with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo but there is still plenty they need to work on to improve as a cohesive unit.
Add in a fit and firing Benjamin Sesko and they will definitely cause plenty of teams problems, but there is still plenty to solve for Ruben Amorim.
They played as well as they could against Arsenal but still lost the game. That's not the best sign for a team.
I still can't see them not being around the middle of the table come the end of the season without further improvement before the transfer window closes.
Chelsea were not good against Crystal Palace. The draw was worrying.
If Cole Palmer isn't going to break a team down, I'm not sure who is for Chelsea.
Palmer is now the talk of the town in team talks up against Chelsea. Teams are trying to stop him because they think stop him, stop Chelsea. Stop Cole Palmer will be the message for West Ham on Friday. That's just how it is.
He needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.
But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.
It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.
It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.
You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.
I'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.
That was a must-win game against Burnley. I expected it to be a bit tighter so credit to Spurs for that, but it would have been a shock had they not got all three points at the weekend.
It was a good result, but the acid test is still to come. Let's see how they perform at Man City at the weekend and then we can start to make a judgement.
People were going mad about the PSG performance but there's still a long way to go for Spurs.
It wasn't hard for Thomas Frank to change things up considering what came before. Ange Postecoglou's Spurs were so open, as open as you can ever seem from a football manager and team, so it wasn't going to take much to adjust.
You don't need to be Albert Einstein to work out how to play against PSG. You need as many defenders as you can on the pitch. Then, against Burnley, you need as many attackers on the pitch as you can to keep causing them problems.
A lot of Tottenham fans have been on already saying this is it, but the acid test is against Man City this weekend and he can set up to stop Pep Guardiola's side playing.

"'Broken promises' - what's going on with Isak, Newcastle and Liverpool?","Alexander Isak says promises have been ""broken"" by Newcastle United and ""the relationship can't continue"" as he looks to force through an exit this summer.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce934rgyg57o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 19 Aug 2025 20:21:56",Sami Mokbel,['Liverpool'],"Alexander Isak says promises have been ""broken"" by Newcastle United and ""the relationship can't continue"" as he looks to force through an exit this summer.
Nineteen days have passed since Newcastle rejected Liverpool's £110m bid for the Sweden international, who remains in a stand-off with the club over his future.
BBC Sport understands Isak believed he would be allowed to leave Newcastle if a big club came in for him and offered the right price.
On Tuesday, Isak posted a statement on Instagram to explain why he was not in attendance at the Professional Footballers' Association's awards gala, where he was named in the Premier League team of the season.
""I've kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken,"" he wrote.
""That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn't reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors.
""The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading.
""When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue. That's where things are for me right now - and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself.""
In a later statement, a ""disappointed"" Newcastle said: ""We are clear in response that Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer.
""We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views.
""As explained to Alex and his representatives, we must always take into consideration the best interests of Newcastle United, the team and our supporters in all decisions and we have been clear that the conditions of a sale this summer have not transpired. We do not foresee those conditions being met.""
Isak has been the biggest talking point of the summer window, which closes on 1 September.
But Liverpool are yet to return with an improved offer for the 25-year-old.
Will the Reds bid again? Will he rejoin first-team training in the meantime? What happens if a deal is not completed by the 1 September deadline day?
BBC Sport has spoken to a number of sources in an attempt to get the latest on these questions and what might happen next.
Why haven't Liverpool made another bid for Isak?
To explain this we need to look at Newcastle's transfers so far.
After a frustrating summer window, their business has started to pick up.
They signed midfielder Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa for £40m on Sunday, after securing AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw for a reported £34.6m earlier in the week.
This added to July's £55m signing of Nottingham Forest winger Anthony Elanga and the loan signing of England goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale early in August.
But there is one glaring omission.
None of these are strikers - and they really needed one before Isak's future was thrown into question after the departure of Callum Wilson.
Sources have told BBC Sport one reason there hasn't yet been a follow-up bid is that any move would be reliant on Newcastle getting two strikers through the door.
Newcastle have maintained publicly that Isak isn't for sale, but Liverpool know they are looking for two strikers for a reason.
When - or perhaps if - Newcastle get those two signings in, Liverpool are expected to ramp up their interest with another bid.
Sources say the next offer will be a minimum £120m. At the moment, though, it's a waiting game.
What is happening with Newcastle's own striker hunt?
So that focuses the mind on to Newcastle's striker hunt.
Eddie Howe made no bones about it at the weekend.
""It's not like we are looking at any other area,"" the Newcastle head coach said following his side's goalless draw against Aston Villa on Saturday.
But securing a replacement for Wilson has proved challenging enough - let alone a second additional striker.
Newcastle remain interested in Yoane Wissa but have not yet met Brentford's asking price of in excess of £40m.
The DR Congo forward, who was left out of the squad for Sunday's 3-1 loss at Nottingham Forest, wants to join Newcastle.
Jorgen Strand Larsen is among a small number of centre-forwards on Newcastle's radar, but Wolves do not want to lose him.
Larsen only completed a permanent move to Molineux last month after a successful loan spell in which he scored 14 goals in the Premier League.
The club have already let Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri go this summer.
Larsen and Wissa illustrate the difficulty Newcastle face, at this stage of the window, to convince a side to part with another key player.
It fell to Anthony Gordon to lead the line on the opening day and, as it stands, it would be a surprise if the winger did not start up top against Liverpool on Monday night.
Why have Newcastle found it hard to close some deals?
After missing out on a number of targets this summer, it felt like there had been a shift in momentum in the last week after completed moves for Thiaw and Ramsey.
But don't forget Newcastle have seen top targets like Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko and Joao Pedro move elsewhere this summer.
These strikers ended up at Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea respectively and as well as facing intense competition from such clubs, there are other factors at play.
Take replacing Wilson, for instance.
Firstly, centre-forwards want minutes so there was not necessarily a queue of quality frontmen lining up to play a supporting role before Isak stopped training with the group.
Secondly, goalscorers are expensive.
Newcastle may be in a much stronger financial position this summer after substantial historic losses dropped out of the club's new three-year Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) cycle.
But they still have to be smart to sign what those behind the scenes call the ""right"" player.
There is not a long list of targets and Newcastle have found that when one coveted striker has potentially become available this summer, his price has then gone up.
However pressing the need, in the final throes of the window, Newcastle are wary of overpaying given the knock-on effect such a splurge could have on the club's ability to strengthen in subsequent windows.
If Isak doesn't move, can he be reintegrated into the fold?
That remains a big 'if', of course.
Howe has been consistent in his messaging throughout this saga: the door remains open to Isak.
But the Newcastle head coach stressed what happens next is down to the striker, who continues to train away from the group.
In their statement on Tuesday night, Newcastle said: ""This is a proud football club with proud traditions and we strive to retain our family feel. Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his team-mates.""
It certainly felt a long way back for Isak on Saturday after the away end called the Swede ""greedy"" following the goalless draw against Villa.
Yet time is against Isak if he is to get a move to Liverpool, particularly when there are few realistic options left on the market who would be capable of stepping up for Newcastle.
Omar Chaudhuri, the chief intelligence officer of Twenty First Group, who previously worked with clubs like Newcastle and Tottenham, has noticed a ""greater interest in top-class strikers"" compared to years gone by.
""Globally, there have been seven centre-forwards moving for 50m euros or more this window, compared to two in 2024, six in 2023, and five in 2022,"" he said.
""But clubs should probably temper expectations as to their impact. Of the 19 strikers signed by Premier League clubs for 50m euros or more before this season, perhaps, only Haaland and Isak can be considered unqualified successes.""
No wonder Howe has maintained that the door is open.
Trying to, somehow, reintegrate Isak may yet prove one of Newcastle's better options - and that is saying something.

Racist abuse will 'not bring down' Tottenham's Tel,"Tottenham forward Mathys Tel says ""none"" of the online racist abuse he got after the club's defeat in the Uefa Super Cup will ""bring him down"".",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce934yj0d2mo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Tue, 19 Aug 2025 22:57:15",,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham forward Mathys Tel says the online racist abuse he received after the club's recent defeat in the Uefa Super Cup will not ""bring him down"".
The 20-year-old Frenchman was the target of abusive messages on social media after Spurs lost the match 4-3 on penalties after letting a two-goal lead slip in normal time.
Tel came on as a substitute in the 79th minute and was one of two Spurs players who failed to convert from the spot in the penalty shootout.
Spurs said they were ""disgusted"" by the abuse and those who sent the messages to Tel, who joined the north London club from Bayern Munich permanently in the summer, were ""nothing but cowards"".
Speaking for the first time since the incident in a post on his Instagram account, external Tel said he wanted to say ""thank you"" for all the ""messages of support"" he had received.
""I was also disappointed about Wednesday night but racism has no place in our society. Every day is a learning curve, and every day is a lesson,"" Tel said.
""I know where I come from, where I started and none of this will bring me down. With work and humility, respect reigns.""
Tel's comments come in the wake of racist abuse suffered by Bournemouth player Antoine Semenyo in their opening match of the Premier League season against Liverpool at Anfield.
Last Friday's game with the current champions was briefly halted in the 29th minute after Semenyo flagged it up to the referee.
A 47-year-old man from Liverpool, who was arrested by Merseyside Police on Saturday on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence, has been conditionally bailed.

City signed Echeverri from River Plate for £12.5m in January 2024, but the player will now continue his development in Germany under ex-Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag.
Further City outgoings before deadline day?
Last week, City boss Pep Guardiola reiterated the need for a smaller squad saying leaving players out is ""not healthy"" and that he ""cannot create a good atmosphere to compete"".
Tottenham have been in talks to sign winger Savinho, but sources have told BBC Sport that City don't want to sell the Brazilian unless they receive a fee worth considering.
Goalkeeper Ederson has been heavily linked with a move to Galatasaray and the 32-year-old missed the opening game victory over Wolves because of illness.
It is understood the Turkish champions have also reached out to City expressing an interest in signing defender Manuel Akanji.
However, a sale would only be sanctioned if the offer is right and the 30-year-old Swiss international indicates a desire to leave Etihad Stadium.
Championship side Wrexham have agreed a deal worth up to £8m to sign City defender Callum Doyle.
The transfer window closes on Monday 1 September at 19:00 BST.

‘Trust is lost’: Isak accuses Newcastle of broken promises in transfer drama,"‘The relationship cannot continue,’ striker says",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/19/alexander-isak-opens-up-newcastle-standoff-pfa-awards,"Tue, 19 Aug 2025 20:51:08",Louise Taylor,['Liverpool'],"Alexander Isak’s standoff with Newcastle threatened to descend into outright civil war on Tuesday night as the Sweden striker accused his club of breaking promises and betraying his trust. In an incendiary Instagram message he claimed their relationship “could not continue”.
Isak has been endeavouring to force a move to Liverpool all summer but, so far, at least Newcastle have proved resistant, rejecting one £110m bid as they struggle to find replacements.
The striker was due to have attended the Professional Footballers’ Association players’ player of the year awards in Manchester on Tuesday having been nominated for the top prize but he sent his apologies via his explosive social media post.
Shortly after Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah won the main award for a third time, Isak’s words sent shockwaves through the corridors of power at St James’ Park. “When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can’t continue,” he posted after expressing pride at being voted on to the PFA Premier League team of the 2024-25 season.
Isak then thanked his teammates and “everyone at Newcastle” for supporting him along the way before increasing the pressure on the club’s Saudi Arabian owners to sanction his longed-for sale to Anfield.
“I’m not at the ceremony tonight,” he posted. “With everything going on, it didn’t feel right to be there.
“I’ve kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn’t reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors.
“The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading.
“When promises are broken and trust is lost the relationship can’t continue. That’s where things are for me right now – and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself.”
Isak was understood to be furious when what he believed to be a promised pay rise was postponed last summer. At the time he had four years remaining on his contract worth £140,000 a week. His camp claim that last spring he made it clear to Newcastle’s manager and the club that he wanted to leave this summer, but Howe and the board interpret things very differently.
This summer Isak skipped the club’s pre-season tour of Singapore and South Korea citing a thigh injury, undetectable on scans. He then spent a week training alone at his former club Real Sociedad, an excursion Howe learned about only through the media.
More recently Isak has been training alone at Newcastle after other players have departed and he was excluded from a club social barbecue after refusing Howe’s overtures to reintegrate.
Newcastle’s manager has said that Isak is “in control” of the situation. The board were preparing to fine the striker, who is understood to have rejected offers of a much-enhanced contract extension, the maximum permissible two weeks’ wages after he missed the club’s opening game of the season last Saturday, a goalless draw at Aston Villa.
Later on Tuesday evening, Newcastle released a statement: “We are clear in response that Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer.
“We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views. As explained to Alex and his representatives, we must always take into consideration the best interests of Newcastle United, the team and our supporters in all decisions and we have been clear that the conditions of a sale this summer have not transpired.
“We do not foresee those conditions being met.
“This is a proud football club with proud traditions and we strive to retain our family feel. Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his teammates.”

Prolific Salah and Caldentey rewarded with PFA player of the year awards,Liverpool forward wins honour for the third time,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/19/prolific-mohamed-salah-and-mariona-caldentey-rewarded-with-pfa-player-of-the-year-awards,"Tue, 19 Aug 2025 20:00:20",Louise Taylor,"['Arsenal', 'Liverpool']","Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Arsenal’s Mariona Caldentey have won the 2025 awards for the Professional Footballers’ Association players’ player of the year.
Salah becomes the first player to collect the prestigious men’s award three times. It would have been a shock had the Egypt forward not triumphed on Tuesday night at the ceremony in Manchester, given he scored 29 Premier League goals and created a further 18 as Liverpool won the title last season, the 33-year-old enjoying one of his very best campaigns of an already gilded career.
Salah said: “I look at myself now, a guy coming from Egypt and making it to the top level, making history today, it’s something that makes me so proud.”
Caldentey also shone in her first season as an Arsenal player, with the Spain forward helping the club to end an 18-year wait for European glory by defeating her former team Barcelona in the Champions League final in Lisbon.
Along the way, Caldentey scored 19 times in all competitions, including seven Champions League goals. She becomes the third Arsenal player to receive the PFA women’s award, following in the footsteps of Kim Little in 2013 and Vivianne Miedema in 2019.
Caldentey spent July this year in Switzerland, starring for Spain at Euro 2025. She scored the opening goal in the final against England in Basel before ending with a runners-up medal after the Lionesses prevailed on penalties.
“Everyone at the club has made it so easy for me and they helped me from the start and it just feels like home and I’m happy to be here,” Caldentey said.
“If you ask me my position I don’t know what to answer, but I just enjoy it on the pitch and I just want to help my teammates. They’ve made everything so easy for me so it has been an incredible pleasure.”
Caldentey’s new Arsenal teammate Olivia Smith is the women’s young player of the year, with the equivalent men’s award going to Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers. Smith, a 21-year-old Canada forward, became the most expensive signing in women’s football history when she arrived in north London from Liverpool for £1m last month. Smith scored seven goals in 20 appearances last season and collected a series of player-of-the-year awards on Merseyside.
Rogers turned 23 last month and is already a senior England international after scoring 14 goals in 54 appearances in all competitions for Villa last season.
James Trafford has become the first goalkeeper to win the Championship player of the year award after keeping 29 clean sheets and conceding only 16 league goals as Burnley were promoted from the second tier. No player has registered more clean sheets or conceded fewer goals during a season in the Football League’s history and it is no surprise that Trafford’s excellence prompted his recent return to Manchester City.
Overall, though, it was very much a night for strikers, with Richard Kone collecting the League One honour for the attacking performances for Wycombe that led to him moving to Queens Park Rangers.
Bromley’s prolific forward Michael Cheek received the League Two prize, while there were special merit awards for the former England manager Sir Gareth Southgate and the USA head coach, Emma Hayes.

Football transfer rumours: Spurs eye Monaco’s Maghnes Akliouche? Tyler Dibling to Palace?,Today’s fluff is stuck on,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/20/football-transfer-rumours-spurs-eye-monacos-maghnes-akliouche-tyler-dibling-to-palace,"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 07:22:03",Will Unwin,"['Manchester City', 'Tottenham Hotspur']","After all the excitement surrounding the prospect of Savinho leaving Manchester City to join Tottenham, it might eventually transpire that the Londoners are not willing to pay a whopping £70m for a winger who does not score. Therefore they need to construct a cunning plan B. Conveniently this is already on the big blackboard in the recruitment room. Maghnes Akliouche of Monaco is the second option and would be considerable cheaper than the Brazilian, coming in at round £47.5m.
Tottenham, as is well-documented, are in talks over the signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace. If that goes through, one potential replacement for the winger at Selhurst Park is Southampton’s Tyler Dibling, who is still waiting for his big summer move after interest from Nottingham Forest, Everton and some Bundesliga clubs.
Nicolas Jackson’s name has cropped up on more days than not in this daily column of transfer tittle-tattle. Needless to say, a lot of what is said about the striker has little substance but the latest talk might not head into the ether quite so soon. Aston Villa really need a new No 9 and Chelsea are quite eager to get rid of the Senegalese frontman, which could make this a gloriously symbiotic move for everyone.
As the opening weekend proved, Wolves and West Ham really need to do some business before the window slams in their faces. It might not therefore be particularly helpful that they both want the same player, nor to mention it might be difficult to convince Marc Casadó boyhood club Barcelona to move to Premier League teams who will almost certainly struggle this season but it is worth a try.
Everything is going swimmingly at Marseille after one game this season. And by that, we mean it’s absolute chaos. An opening night defeat to Rennes on Friday concluded with England Under-21 international Jonathan Rowe have a good old fashioned dustup with teammate Adrien Rabiot, a man no stranger to controversy. Both were almost immediately placed on the transfer list. The good news for Rowe is that he is already in talks with Bologna about going to Italy, only a couple of months after completing a permanent move to the south of France from Norwich. Rabiot, one assumes, will be linked with every Premier League club as he has been for most of the past decade.
Veteran striker Jamie Vardy is still looking for a new club after leaving Leicester. The 38-year-old still has plenty to give despite his veteran status and has been linked with a move north of the border to Celtic where he would link up with his former Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers. “Listen, I would not speak about any individual player,” said Rodgers of the rumours. “Of course I worked really well with Jamie, he was brilliant for me in my time at Leicester. But there’s been so many names floated about. I wouldn’t disclose either way.”
Ipswich are keen to bolster their ranks in midfield and make a cheeky little loan offer to sign Newcastle teenager Lewis Miley but Eddie Howe is eager to keep the 19-year-old at St James’ Park and give him more of a chance. Elsewhere in the Championship, the former West Ham forward Dapo Afolayan may St Pauli leave St Pauli this month and is wanted by Leicester, West Brom and Blackburn. There’s also interest in Belgium from Gent and Genk.

RB Leipzig step up Nkunku interest to provide Chelsea boost for potential signings,Nkunku’s former club are looking into permanent deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/19/chelsea-christopher-nkunku-bayern-munich-xavi-simons-alejandro-garnacho,"Tue, 19 Aug 2025 18:19:06",Jacob Steinberg,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester United']","RB Leipzig have stepped up attempts to sign Christopher Nkunku on a permanent deal, potentially paving the way for Chelsea to accelerate their search for attacking reinforcements.
Chelsea need sales before pressing ahead with moves for Leipzig’s Xavi Simons and Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho but their hopes of shifting Nkunku appeared to have hit a dead end when Bayern Munich’s move for the forward stalled. Bayern had an offer for the Frenchman – a loan with an option to buy – rejected over the weekend and have so far shown little inclination of wanting to pay enough to buy him. Chelsea’s preference is a permanent sale rather than a loan for Nkunku as he is not part of their long-term plans.
Inter are also interested in Nkunku, whose contract runs until 2029, but a return to Leipzig two years after leaving them for Chelsea for £52m is a possibility. The 27-year-old forward is open to a reunion with his former club, although other options are on the table. A deal with Leipzig is not close but there is confidence that they will be able to come to an agreement with Chelsea on a fee for the France international, who has struggled for form and fitness during his time in west London.
The clubs have already held talks over Chelsea adding Simons to their attacking ranks. Chelsea are yet to lodge a bid for the Netherlands international, who wants to move to Stamford Bridge, and hope to move out fringe players before making further additions. Aston Villa are interested in Nicolas Jackson but would need a significant drop in his £80m asking price if they are to pursue a deal for the striker. Jackson wants a new challenge after seeing Chelsea sign Liam Delap and João Pedro.
Chelsea have also strengthened on the flanks, signing Estêvão Willian and Jamie Gittens, but they want more depth on the left. They are pushing to sign Garnacho, who is viewed as competition for Gittens, but want United to drop their asking price of £50m for the Argentina winger. Garnacho, who has reportedly turned down a switch to Bayern, has fallen from favour at United and Chelsea are unlikely to want to pay over £40m.
Other players expected to leave Chelsea are Tyrique George, Axel Disasi, Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka and Renato Veiga; the latter of whom is a target for Villarreal. Fulham are interested in Raheem Sterling.
Meanwhile, West Ham have had a bid rejected for Chelsea’s Andrey Santos. The Hammers are interested in the Brazilian but have been knocked back and have now made an improved offer for the Southampton midfielder Mateus Fernandes.

Taking the 1962-63 season as the starting point, what is the lowest position that all current Premier League teams have finished between 1963 and the present?” ask the lads at the Star and Dragon Pub, Carbondale, Illinois. “And what is the lowest any team has fallen that has played at least one season in the top division since 1962-63?”
How the mighty haven’t fallen. Liverpool have shown remarkable consistency since they were promoted to the top flight 63 years ago. They’ve finished eighth on four occasions (1962-63, 1993-94, 2011-12 and 2015-16) and are the only English team in that period never to end a season outside the top half of the top flight.
Thanks to Pete Salmon and Mike Slattery in particular for doing the work on this answer. Let’s start with the lowest positions in the league ladder achieved by the current Premier League teams.
Liverpool 8th (1962-63, 1993-94, 2011-12, 2015-16)

* Everton were not relegated as there were 22 teams in the English top flight.
Fifty-eight teams have played in the top flight since Liverpool’s promotion in the summer of 1962. Six have dropped out of the Football League at some stage: Carlisle, Leyton Orient, Luton, Notts County, Oldham and Oxford. The lowest finishers of the six were Leyton Orient, who came 13th in the National League (105th overall) in 2017-18.

Eagles’ Wembley compilation
“I’ve now seen Crystal Palace lift four different trophies at Wembley (Zenith Data Systems Cup, Championship playoff trophy, FA Cup, Community Shield),” writes Toby Kinder. “Manchester United and Liverpool never managed the ZDS, but have both won the European Cup there, as well as all the domestic trophies, so are probably on four too. Can any other club beat that?”
Selhurst Park, Sunday, 2pm is all we have to say on this subject. “I feel bad for doing this, given the manufactured beef stirred up between our clubs this summer, but Nottingham Forest can go (at least) one better than Palace when it comes to winning different trophies at Wembley,” says Jim Hearson.
“Forest can see the Eagles’ FA Cup (1959), Charity/Community Shield (1978), Championship playoff trophy (2022) and Full Members’ Cup – both Simod and ZDS varieties (1989, 1992) – and raise them a handful of League Cups (1979, 1989, 1990).
Jim adds: “Forest were also victorious at the Wembley-held Football League Centenary Tournament in 1988 but, as they weren’t full-length matches, some uncharitable types may not wish to count it.”
Chelsea have also won five trophies at Wembley: FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield, Full Members’ Cup … and the League South Cup in 1945. “Chelsea beat Millwall 2-0 in front of a crowd of 90,000,” writes Julian Croker. “Eight of the team were actually guest players registered to other clubs.”
Tom Solano nominates West Ham, whose five trophies were the Football League War Cup, FA Cup, Charity Shield, Cup Winners’ Cup and Championship playoff. Sadly, we can’t count the 1966 World Cup, won by a Hammers-heavy England at Wembley.

“On Sunday Scott Brown, Celtic midfielder and Scotland captain, scored against Scott Brown, Aberdeen goalkeeper,” wrote Paul Reilly in 2015. “Are there any other instances of a player scoring past his namesake?”
As Scott Walden emailed to point out, in 2012-13 Gloucester City had the pleasing combination at the back of goalkeeper Mike Green and central defender Mike Green. Confusion was always likely to be a risk and it came to a calamitous head in September in an FA Cup second qualifying round fixture against Thatcham Town.
Four minutes before the break, the Tigers were 1-0 and cruising. Then disaster struck. The Gloucester Citizen picks up the tale: “[Jack] Coventry worked some space on the left but his cross looked to be nothing more than a speculative effort. However, left-back Green and Matt Coupe got their wires crossed in trying to clear and the former poked out a foot and sent the ball past his goalkeeper and into the net.”
A bad day for Mike Green and Mike Green ended well however, with Gloucester running out 2-1 winners.
Can you help?
“Seven of the nine matches in Ligue 1 last weekend finished 1-0,” notes Liam Togher. “That’s 78% of the games. Has there ever been a more common instance of one specific scoreline in a single gameweek?”
“Shelbourne and Linfield meet in the Conference League tomorrow, just over a month after they played each other in Champions League qualifying. Has this happened before? If so, who were the first teams to play each other in two different European competitions in the same season?” asks Mad Mac.
“Every member of Tottenham’s starting XI in the Uefa Super Cup represented a different nationality: Italy, Austria, Argentina, the Netherlands, Spain, Uruguay, Portugal, England, Senegal, Ghana and Brazil. Add Lucas Bergvall for Sweden, Mathys Tel (and several PSG players) for France, players representing Morocco, Ecuador, Georgia and South Korea turning out for PSG, and unused subs from Russia, Czechia, Wales and Croatia. I make that 17 nationalities on the pitch and 21 in total. Is this the most nationally diverse football match of all time?” wonders Jack Hayward.
“While the league table on gameweek one is pretty meaningless, I do like the anomaly of a team who hasn’t played yet being comfortably mid-table with zero points. The question is, how long into a season has it ever been where the bottom three failed to score any points, so hypothetically a team who hadn’t played any games at all would still be outside the relegation zone?” wonders James Rowland.

Manchester United are importing a sinister US tactic: Public money for stadiums,"Similar grand promises made when building US sports arenas are now being used to justify a huge outlay in the UK, with little return to show for them",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/19/manchester-united-new-stadium-public-funding,"Tue, 19 Aug 2025 09:00:13",Manchester United,"['Manchester United', 'Liverpool']","In March, Manchester United officially unveiled images and plans for a new 100,000-seater stadium to replace their aging home, Old Trafford. While the grandiosity of the circus-tent-like structure attracted widespread attention, something else did, too: as part of this project, United are planning to secure land not by paying for it themselves – but by having the UK government do it for them.
In order to clear the site that the club wants to use, a rail freight hub will need to be moved to out near St Helens, between Manchester and Liverpool. The cost of moving the hub is estimated to be between £200m and 300m ($270-405m), but that may be an optimistic appraisal; in the past, the project budget was estimated at closer to £1bn ($1.35bn).
Politicians supporting United’s plan, like Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, have stressed that no public money will be used to build the stadium. But that appears to be a bit of verbal trickery: United’s new stadium cannot be built as planned without moving the freight rail hub; if the government pays to move the hub, they save United from having to do so themselves. (Manchester United declined to respond to a request for comment.)
The plan’s proponents back it by promising it would confer grand economic benefits to Greater Manchester – 92,000 new jobs! 17,000 new homes! 1.8 million additional tourists! – and would be worth over £7bn annually to the UK economy. Sebastian Coe, the chair of the Old Trafford Regeneration Taskforce and a key organizer behind the 2012 London Olympics, has said “I don’t think I’m overstating when I say this actually has the potential to be, not only a bigger project than London 2012 but, in terms of European scope and scale, probably the biggest thing that’s ever really been undertaken.”
If United do secure hundreds of millions of pounds of public money as an ancillary part of the stadium project, the club, knowingly or otherwise, would be continuing a long and ignoble tradition that has become commonplace in America. In the UK, it’s relatively rare for big sports teams to benefit from public money. In the US, however, it’s such a common practice that the record for the largest public subsidy given to a team has been repeatedly shattered in recent years. The Las Vegas Raiders received $750m (£555m) in 2016. The Buffalo Bills got $850m (£629m) in 2022. The Washington Commanders are now in the process of landing over $1bn (£740m).
And all that has happened despite a consensus among American academics that massive injections of public money towards major stadium projects have not led to the widespread economic benefits they promised. “That’s the story they tell to get the public money, but it’s the big lie” of the stadium funding debate, says Pat Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project, “We [in the US] export a lot of problematic things. And I really hope that we don’t export that big lie.”
Adds Geoffrey Propheter, a professor at the University of Colorado-Denver: “In the US, my colleagues and I have the benefit of [decades] worth of examples. We have gotten to see how government intervention in sports facilities has evolved into this monster.” According to Propheter, out of the approximately 125 major league sports facilities across five major men’s leagues – MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, and MLS – only about 10% do not or have not received public money in some form.
In the UK, West Ham and Manchester City play in stadiums built with public money, but in both cases the facilities were built for one-off sporting events (the 2012 Olympics and the 2002 Commonwealth Games, respectively) and then repurposed. According to research by the University of Michigan professor Stefan Szymanski, smaller clubs lower down the pyramid – such as Swansea City and Colchester United – have received some public money, but that spending was seen more as an investment into a community asset like a library or a school rather than as an economic generator.
“In the US it is almost taken as a given now that any new facility will receive taxpayer funding,” says Garofalo. “It’s the ones that don’t that stand out as oddballs.”
The story that Manchester United are telling now is the same one that American sports owners have told, again and again, despite a voluminous and still-growing body of proof that the story isn’t real.
“I stress to my friends in the UK – all the evidence here shows that it’s not true,” Garofalo says. “You are setting this money on fire. And you are doing this to support a massive private business that prints money.”
In 2024, the Portland Sea Dogs – a minor league baseball team in Maine – received a $2m tax break. While the sums of money and the size of the teams being discussed vary widely, there is a parallel between the Sea Dogs and Manchester United: both effectively disguised their solicitations for public money. Just as United aren’t asking for hundreds of millions of pounds to go into their stadium construction budget, the Sea Dogs didn’t ask for $2m to be put in their bank account. But by not having to pay $2m in taxes, that’s effectively what the Sea Dogs got.
Maura Pillsbury of the Maine Center For Economic Policy was part of a network of locals and legislators who pushed back on the Sea Dogs’ tax break, ultimately unsuccessfully. When imagining what she would share with folks in Manchester as they contemplated United’s plan, she says, “Everybody here loves the Sea Dogs and I’m sure everybody there loves Manchester United” (City fans aside, of course) “so it’s hard to say no to. But I would encourage them to think about what they’re sacrificing. Other people are going to have to pay for that. Something is gonna get cut.”

Donald Trump recently signed into law a massive federal budget bill that will slash social programs across the US and directly impact vulnerable populations in Maine. Meanwhile, the Sea Dogs recently unveiled the results of the renovation paid for in part by their tax break. “That was another dagger,” Pillsbury says. “Giving the Sea Dogs $2m – that was a policy choice. Where could have this money gone instead? That’s childcare subsidies, that’s healthcare, that’s food on kids’ plates. The emotional, feelgood nature of these proposals belie the actual reality – there’s a cost and a consequence to making these decisions.”
Propheter says that to “get to where we are now” – where American pro teams have received billions in public money payouts – “it took about 50 years of these stadium messes. I wonder if across the pond, folks are like: ‘Hey, we can get to where America is because we can learn from the NFL, MLB – we can get to ballooning subsidies even faster.’”
One thing standing in the way of this dangerous precedent blossoming in the UK may be the agency of the fans. As United seeks to benefit from public money, will fans – imagining where else their tax pounds could go – push back?
American fans “live in a world of fear,” says the University of Michigan’s Stefan Syzmanski, “because of what terrible thing might happen to them” – namely, their team being taken away.
When a team owner in the US asks for public money, there is the implicit or explicit threat of the owner moving the team if the municipality doesn’t cough up the dough. “As a matter of rote reflex,” Garofalo says, “they threaten to move the team. They have all the leverage to demand these subsidies” lest they have to rip up the team and move away – as, for example, happened when the NFL’s Chargers left San Diego for Los Angeles. “The fans treat the team as a community asset and the owners treat it as a private business.”
But while American sports fans seem to respect team owners’ legal right to manipulate them by threatening to leave, in the UK, Szymanski says, the thinking is different. Relocating your team is “a borderline criminal activity.” And in general, fans don’t think the owners of their teams should get to do whatever they want.
“Manchester United fans do not actually believe” that its proprietors, the Glazer family and Jim Ratcliffe, “own Manchester United,” Szymanski says. “That might be the legal position but the reality” is that they, the club’s supporters, are “the true owners” and that the Glazers and Ratcliffe are “temporary stewards – and pretty shitty ones, at that.”
