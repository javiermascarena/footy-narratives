Liverpool to retire number 20 in honour of Jota,Liverpool have confirmed that the number 20 shirt will be permanently retired in honour of Diogo Jota.,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13395583/diogo-jota-liverpool-confirm-number-20-shirt-will-be-retired-to-honour-forward,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 20:20:00",,['Liverpool'],"Liverpool have confirmed that the number 20 shirt will be permanently retired in honour of Diogo Jota.
The tribute marks the first time Liverpool have retired a player's number throughout their 133-year history, as they honour the lives of Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, who were killed in a car crash in Spain on July 3.
The retirement applies to the club at all levels, including men's first team, women's team and all academy sides.
Liverpool came to the decision after consulting with Jota's wife, Rute, and other members of his family.
A statement from the club read: ""The move is recognition of not only the immeasurable contribution our lad from Portugal made to the Reds' on-pitch successes over the last five years, but also the profound personal impact he had on his teammates, colleagues and supporters and the everlasting connections he built with them.""
Club CEO Michael Edwards also spoke on the matter, saying: ""As a club, we were all acutely aware of the sentiment of our supporters - and we felt exactly the same way.
""It was vitally important to us to involve Diogo's wife, Rute, and his family in the decision and to ensure they were the first to know of our intention.
""I believe this is the first time in Liverpool Football Club's history that such an honour has been bestowed upon an individual. Therefore, we can say this is a unique tribute to a uniquely wonderful person.
""By retiring this squad number, we are making it eternal - and therefore never to be forgotten.
""Diogo joined us in 2020, he won us number 20, and he wore - with honour, distinction and affection - the number 20.
""As far as Liverpool Football Club is concerned, he will be forever our number 20.""
The Reds have also announced plans to pay tribute to them during Sunday's pre-season friendly against Preston.
There will be a rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' prior to the 3pm kick-off and Preston will lay a wreath alongside the away supporters, Liverpool said.
A minute's silence will then be observed, with digital tributes displayed on the stadium big screen and on pitchside LED boards.
Players from both teams will wear black armbands.
The pre-match programme will also feature written tributes to Jota and Silva.

Sky Sports News understands Forest have ceased all communication with Spurs as things stand. However, Tottenham are hopeful their deal for the England international will still be completed.
Forest believe Spurs made an illegal approach to the player and never granted permission for them to speak to him.
Sky Sports News reported on Thursday that Tottenham had triggered a £60m release clause in his Forest contract.
Forest believe there has also been a breach in confidentiality around his release clause because Tottenham's bid was pitched at exactly that level.
It is not yet clear if Forest are able to block the transfer entirely. However, it is now expected to be delayed as Forest prepare a complaint to the Premier League.
Forest have refused to comment on Sky Sports News' information. Spurs did not comment when contacted.

A poll conducted by Sky Sports shows around 70 per cent of 35,000 voters feel he would be a bad signing. Some have even signed a petition against the deal.
For many, the frustration stems from Arsenal shopping at Chelsea again. Madueke will become the seventh player in six years to move from Stamford Bridge to the Emirates Stadium. The list holds cautionary tales in David Luiz, Willian and Raheem Sterling.
Go back further and there are more examples, from William Gallas and Lassana Diarra to Petr Cech. Overall, it is clear which club has benefitted most from the transactions. Even the more successful signings, most notably Kai Havertz, continue to split opinion.
The £65m fee paid for Havertz remains a subject of debate, two years on, and the finances involved in the deal for Madueke are even more contentious. Arsenal will pay up to £52m, allowing Chelsea to make a huge profit on a player they signed for £29m in 2023.
It is a hefty fee, particularly for a player who primarily plays in the same position as Bukayo Saka. Arsenal fans are entitled to wonder whether Madueke has done enough in the last two and a half years at Chelsea to justify a 70 per cent increase in his value.
A lack of end product has been a source of frustration. Madueke started last season with a hat-trick against Wolves in a 6-2 win at Molineux but went on to score only seven times and provide only three assists in 32 Premier League appearances in total.
The top-line numbers are modest but Arsenal will have noted that they could easily have been higher. Statistically, Madueke's shots were worth a total of 9.66 expected goals.
The fact he scored nearly three goals fewer than 'expected' can be interpreted as evidence he is a poor finisher but it is more likely down to variance. Last season looks an outlier; the first in Madueke's career in which he has underperformed on his expected goals.
Arsenal will feel confident that a reversion to the mean could bring higher returns in future and, even amid questions over his end-product, there is no doubting the threat he provides.
Madueke ranked among the Premier League's top 15 players for non-penalty expected goals and expected assists combined per 90 minutes last season. He was in the top 10 for shots per 90 minutes and even higher for touches in the opposition box, in fifth.
Long-legged and upright, he is not the most aesthetically pleasing of players. His running style can appear awkward. But he is a quick and effective ball-carrier whose directness would give Arsenal another weapon on transitions and when breaking down compact defences.
Last season, he ranked top among all Premier League players for shot-ending carries per 90 minutes, on 1.63. His average of 1.98 successful dribbles put him nearly level with Saka (2.13) and a long way ahead of either Martinelli (1.29) or Leandro Trossard (1.34).
Of course, Madueke's best work has come from the right-hand side, where Saka has become a fixture in Mikel Arteta's team. The academy product is Arsenal's best and most important player.
Madueke's chance of usurping him looks slim. What he can do, though, is provide a high-quality alternative, sharing his England team-mate's workload and therefore lowering the risk of another injury like the hamstring tear that proved so costly last term.
Surely, though, Arsenal are not spending £50m just for a Saka back-up? Especially when they already have the hugely promising Ethan Nwaneri, whose development should remain a priority.
With reports suggesting Trossard could be sold this summer, Madueke is also expected to be used as an option on the left.
It is reasonable for Arsenal fans to feel underwhelmed at that prospect given previous links to more high-profile targets such as Real Madrid's Rodrygo. Madueke, unlike the Brazil international, is not even a natural on that side.
On the face of it, his appearances on the left for Chelsea in the final weeks of last season do not appear to offer much encouragement either. Madueke produced no goals or assists when starting on that side. He did, though, produce some encouraging displays.
There was a particularly eye-catching performance in a 1-0 win over Everton in April, when he forced a string of saves from Jordan Pickford. A week later, in a 3-1 win over Liverpool, he was similarly dangerous, with Arne Slot describing the problems caused by his dribbling as ""something he hadn't seen before"" against his side.
Madueke was subsequently used on the left by England boss Thomas Tuchel. He was one of few players to impress in their narrow World Cup qualifying win over Andorra last month.
Still, it is not the most compelling body of work.
Madueke was used almost exclusively on the right-hand side by former club PSV Eindhoven. Less than 10 per cent of his Premier League minutes have come on the left for Chelsea.
Madueke will need to prove his left-wing credentials to Arsenal fans. Some will say he also has something to prove in terms of his work rate and temperament.
Enzo Maresca clearly valued Madueke, starting him more times than any other Chelsea winger last season, but he also questioned the consistency of his application. ""Noni can do much more,"" he said in December, before dropping him for a game against Fulham. ""He has to understand that he has to train well every day.""
Maresca's comments, coupled with an unseemly dispute with team-mate Nicolas Jackson over a penalty against Everton last year, have contributed to shaping negative perceptions of Madueke but others who have coached him paint a very different picture.
Saul Isaksson-Hurst, a technical and skills specialist who has been working with Madueke on an individual basis since his time at PSV, described him as a ""mentality monster"" in conversation with Sky Sports before his move to Chelsea.
""He is so driven,"" he added. ""He's got such a clear vision of what he wants to do and he is willing to put the work in."" This is, after all, a young player who chose to leave Tottenham's academy for PSV at the age of only 16 in the interests of self-improvement.
Another coach who worked with Madueke in England's youth teams describes him in similar terms when asked by Sky Sports, saying he is a ""lovely lad"" who is ""driven to succeed and single-minded"", and who ""listens to the advice of his coaches.""
That same sentiment came across from Maresca's predecessor Mauricio Pochettino in May of last year, when, in the press room at Stamford Bridge after a win over Tottenham, he singled out Madueke for his ""unbelievable"" defensive work in helping rookie full-back Alfie Gilchrist deal with Heung-Min Son.
For Arteta, the hope is that he will be able to mould Madueke into the player he needs, whether that's on the right or the left.
But there is no escaping that it is a high-risk move at the price. On some levels, the doubts of supporters are understandable. Madueke is not an obvious upgrade on either flank. He does, though, have exciting tools to work with, and, at 23, potential to be tapped into.

Arsenal close to Madueke deal after Chelsea give permission to leave CWC,Chelsea have given Noni Madueke permission to leave their Club World Cup camp in the USA to finalise a &#163;52m move to Arsenal.&#160;,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13395213/noni-madueke-transfer-news-arsenal-close-to-agreeing-52m-deal-for-chelsea-winger,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:49:00",,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea']","Chelsea have given Noni Madueke permission to leave their Club World Cup camp in the USA to finalise a £52m move to Arsenal.
The England international is expected to join the Gunners for an initial £48m plus £4m in add-ons.
The 23-year-old will undergo a medical with Arsenal soon.
Arsenal have been looking to sign a left-sided forward this summer, although Madueke featured 33 times on the right side of Chelsea's attack during the 2024/25 season and on only seven occasions on the left, contributing no goals or assists in that time.
The Gunners, who have also looked at a number of other players in the forward positions, including Real Madrid's Rodrygo, have both Bukayo Saka and Ethan Nwaneri to fill the right-winger spot.
Chelsea signed Madueke from PSV for £29m in January 2023 and he has five years left on his contract. However, the Blues have strengthened significantly in attacking areas this summer.
Liam Delap arrived for £30m from Ipswich and Joao Pedro joined from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m.
The west London club also added Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for an initial fee of £48.5m, plus £3.5m in potential add-ons.
Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca:
""Noni is in contact with the new club and I guess he is going to be [announced] in the next hours. Selling him to a rival? If players want to leave, then it is difficult for the club and the manager.""
""Noni decided to leave. Nobody told Noni he had to leave. If he is happy, we are happy.""
Real Madrid forward Rodrygo is the other top target Arsenal have for that position but it appears unlikely they are going to sign both players.
Rodrygo would certainly be the more exciting signing given his profile and pedigree, being a two-time Champions League winner.
Reports in Spain indicate he is valued at around £69m (€80m) - more than Chelsea demanded for Madueke.
Rodrygo's future at Real is up in the air under new boss Xabi Alonso, who gave him a limited role at the Club World Cup. The Brazil forward only started one of their six matches.
The 24-year-old has become known for being a right winger at Madrid but his preferred position is on the left, which would suit Arsenal's needs.
Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:
Arsenal's pursuit of Noni Madueke has been a surprise - and a significant transfer fee put towards the Chelsea winger would split opinion in the Gunners fanbase.
Arsenal are looking for a new winger to refresh their wide options but many expected the No 1 target to be Real Madrid's Rodrygo or Athletic Club's Nico Williams.
Both have the status and talent to match what Bukayo Saka does on the opposite flank.
As a right winger, Madueke would provide the Gunners with suitable cover for Saka - but is he the answer for Arsenal as a first-choice left winger?
The 23-year-old played most of last season on the right but it is worth noting that eight out of his last nine appearances for club and country have come on the left wing.
In his seven starts for Chelsea on the left last term, Madueke failed to get a goal, an assist or create a big chance in any of them. Looking at the numbers and his overall play, he seems more comfortable on the right.
However, it is worth noting that Chelsea did win six of those seven games where Madueke started on the left - the only defeat was the 2-0 loss at Newcastle, where Nicolas Jackson was sent off and Madueke was sacrificed at half-time.
Madueke did get an assist for England's winner against Andorra after starting on the left wing. But is Madueke going to significantly improve Arsenal's options in that position, even though he may be cheaper than Rodrygo?
Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:
""I think it's a bit of a complicated situation regarding Madueke because he's played well for Chelsea since they signed him two-and-a-half years ago from PSV for £29m. But it's been well documented that Chelsea have spent a lot of money in the transfer window already this summer and they need to balance their books.
""Last week they came to an agreement with UEFA that basically said that if they want to register new players for the Champions League next season, they have to make sure that their transfer spend this season is balanced out this summer by the players they sell as well.
""So they've signed players like Liam Delap and Joao Pedro. That means they also have to sell players.""

Rashford becomes Barca's top left-wing target - Sky in Germany,"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is now Barcelona's clear left-wing target, according to <em>Sky in Germany</em>.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13395354/marcus-rashford-transfer-news-man-utd-forward-becomes-barcelonas-top-left-wing-target-sky-in-germany,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 10:58:00",,['Manchester United'],"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is now Barcelona's clear left-wing target, according to Sky in Germany.
Barca are expected to try and agree a deal and are ""prepared to go all-in"".
This is because Liverpool have rejected their advances for Luis Diaz, and Nico Williams has signed a new deal at Athletic Club.
Sky Sports News has already reported that Rashford is keen to join Barcelona.
The forward has returned to Carrington despite being offered extra time off and is training away from the first team, using the medical and rehab facilities.
The 27-year-old is among five Man Utd players who can explore a potential move away after expressing a desire to leave.
Matheus Cunha has taken the No 10 shirt from Rashford, who said he wanted a ""new challenge"" before joining Aston Villa for the second half of last season.
One source has told Sky Sports News it has been made clear to Rashford that he does not figure in Ruben Amorim's plans, and the England international is keen to pursue opportunities elsewhere.
There have been no official offers for Rashford after he returned from his loan at Villa.
Sky Sports News has previously reported that Rashford wants to play Champions League football next season, but is not willing to relocate to London. His representatives are also against their client being involved in any part-exchange deal.
Sky Sports News' senior football news editor Lyall Thomas:
Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.
And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.
That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.
Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.
Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did two weeks ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.

Club World Cup heat 'very dangerous' - Fernandez,Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has urged Fifa to re-think kick-off times to mitigate the 'very dangerous' heat in the United States at the Club World Cup.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c78nxlz24z9o,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 18:01:56",Nizaar Kinsella,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez said he has felt ""dizzy"" while playing in ""very dangerous"" heat at the Club World Cup in the United States.
The 24-year-old has featured in all six of Chelsea's matches en route to the final against Paris St-Germain in New Jersey on Sunday.
Three of Chelsea's games were played in temperatures described as ""extreme heat"", with local weather warnings urging people against involvement in strenuous physical activity or being outside.
In New Jersey, where Sunday's final takes place, temperatures have reached 38C in recent days.
Manager Enzo Maresca has complained it is ""impossible"" to have a normal training session because of the heat, despite reaching the final of the lucrative and newly-expanded tournament.
When asked about the experience of playing at the Club World Cup, Fernandez said: ""Honestly, the heat is incredible. The other day I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy.
""Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous. Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home.
""The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow.""
Players and managers have also complained about afternoon kick-off times throughout the tournament, which are designed in part to help TV audiences in Europe and Africa watch matches at convenient times.
Fernandez, who is likely to be in Argentina's squad at the 2026 World Cup across North America, added: ""Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?""
PSG manager Luis Enrique said ""it is not good for the show"" before their 4-0 semi-final win over Real Madrid on Wednesday.
Chelsea defender Levi Colwill added: ""Some places have been really hot, the last round was hot and I was stuck watching it and I was thinking: 'wow, this is so tough.' I felt bad for them but they managed it really well.""
Earlier this month, players' union Fifpro said it believed that Chelsea's game v ES Tunis in Philadelphia should have been delayed or postponed because of the heat.
On Thursday, former Germany striker Jurgen Klinsmann, now on Fifa's technical study group, recalled punishing conditions in Dallas during the 1994 World Cup in the United States, but said teams must adapt.
""The heat is difficult. If you play in 90 degree [Fahrenheit; 32C] heat then you are going to suffer,"" Klinsmann said. ""I played in Dallas at 120 degrees [49C] and I was dying!
""We were leading 3-0 at half time, then South Korea came back and made it 3-2 and if we had been on the pitch for another five minutes it would have been 3-3.
""But do I go to Qatar like Germany and complain, complain and bring karma - and then go home early? The teams here now and the teams here next summer who get the draw here in July and July next summer will have to adapt.
""But there will be two teams in the game. It's not always nice, especially for European teams but they will have to adapt.""
In a statement on the heat last week, Fifa said: ""Heat conditions are a serious topic that affect football globally.
""At the Club World Cup some significant and progressive measures are being taken to protect the players from the heat. For instance, cooling breaks were implemented in 31 out of 54 matches so far.
""Discussions on how to deal with heat conditions need to take place collectively and Fifa stands ready to facilitate this dialogue, including through the task force on player welfare, and to receive constructive input from all stakeholders on how to further enhance heat management.
""In all of this, the protection of players must be at the centre.""

Forest consider legal action against Spurs over Gibbs-White,"Nottingham Forest are considering legal action over Tottenham's interest in midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White, sources tell BBC Sport.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y7g44dle3o,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 13:59:05",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Nottingham Forest are considering legal action over Tottenham's interest in midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White, sources have told BBC Sport.
Forest are believed to be looking at whether a specific confidentiality agreement in the £60m release clause in Gibbs-White's contract has been breached.
BBC Sport reported on Thursday that Gibbs-White was set to have a medical on Friday as Spurs look to trigger that release clause.
Sources have told BBC Sport that Forest are furious at Tottenham's conduct in their pursuit of the England international, and they insist Forest's threat to take legal action is genuine.
It is understood Forest insist they have not given Spurs permission to speak to Gibbs-White and are willing to go to whatever lengths required to prevent the transfer taking place.
Under Premier League rules clubs are not allowed to talk to players under contract with another team unless they have permission.
Tottenham are aware of the situation but are still hopeful a deal can be concluded.
Gibbs-White joined Forest from Wolves in a move worth up to £42.5m in August 2022, on a five-year deal. He has made 118 appearances in three years at Forest, scoring 18 goals and providing 28 assists.
He made his England debut as a substitute in the Nations League win over the Republic of Ireland in September under interim manager Lee Carsley, with his most recent appearance coming off the bench in the 3-1 friendly defeat by Senegal at the City Ground under new boss Thomas Tuchel.
Tottenham have already signed Mohammed Kudus from West Ham for £55m this week.
Gibbs-White's team-mate Anthony Elanga is close to joining Newcastle for £55m.

How are Spurs funding spending spree - and where would signings fit in?,Tottenham look set to spend £115m on deals for Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibb-White. BBC Sport looks at where the funding is coming from and how the signings would fit.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8e4g51g892o,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:25:39","Sami Mokbel, Noel Sliney and Matt Hobbs",['Tottenham Hotspur'],"The last 48 hours or so have seemed very un-Tottenham like.
Preparing to commit £115m on Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White isn't behaviour you'd necessarily associate with Spurs in the Daniel Levy era.
The general feeling around Tottenham and their transfer market spending in recent years has been one of frugality – although those at Spurs would be quick to point out they did spend £55m on Dominic Solanke last season, in a deal that could eventually become a club-record £65m.
Yet you can't escape the sense that the previous couple of days represents a change in narrative.
If Gibbs-White's £60m signing from Nottingham Forest goes through - after some late legal issues - it will be the biggest initial fee paid by the club.
Tottenham remain hopeful the deal will be completed despite Forest looking at whether a confidentiality agreement in the player's contract had been breached. It is also understood the club are claiming Spurs haven't asked permission to speak to the player.
Heading into the summer transfer window, well-placed sources indicated the club would be limited in the amount they would be able to spend.
But the capture of Kudus for £55m and the potential arrival of Gibbs-White for £60m flies in the face of any such restrictions.
So what has changed?
It is no secret Tottenham chairman Levy has been canvassing for external investment into the club in recent months.
However, BBC Sport understands the current spending on transfers is more likely to be the result of an injection of cash from owners Enic, who are understood to have kept a closer eye on club operations in recent months, rather than any external investment.
There has been talk of overseas investment – particularly from the Middle East.
For fans, of course, the source of the finances is neither here nor there.
All they really care about is the assembling of a team that can eventually challenge for the title and qualify consistently for the Champions League.
In Kudus and Gibbs-White, they would have two players capable of helping fulfil supporters' wishes.
Both are flair players that live up to Tottenham's attacking traditions and crucially are players who have Premier League experience.
Indeed, that was the remit for the club's recruitment team this summer.
The squad is already packed full of exciting young potential, but experience is what new boss Thomas Frank believes it needs.
While Kudus and Gibbs-White are relatively young - 24 and 25, respectively - they are well-versed in the rigours of England's top-flight.
Kudus has two full seasons for West Ham under his belt, making 80 appearances across all competitions, while Gibbs-White has played in the last three Premier League campaigns for Forest and had prior experience while a teenager at Wolves.
Spurs' interest in Brentford duo Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo is further illustration of Tottenham's recruitment remit.
Unusual big-money deals or continuing a trend?
The Gibbs-White deal - if it goes through - would take Tottenham's summer spending to £170m in initial fees, including the permanent signings of Mathys Tel and Kevin Danso after loan spells last season.
That kind of outlay may feel atypical to some supporters but it actually continues a recent trend of heavy spending by the club.
They were among the Premier League's top five highest spenders in each of the previous three summers, including a £219m splurge on eight players in 2023 shortly after Ange Postecoglou was appointed head coach. That figure was partially offset by Harry Kane's £86.5m move to Bayern Munich.
It's true to say, though, Spurs don't often spend as much on any individual player as they are hoping to this week. Gibbs-White would be only the fifth £50m-plus signing in their history, just a day or so after Kudus became the fourth.
The sums being spent now are certainly a far cry from 2018, when the club become the first in Premier League history not to sign a single player during a summer transfer window.
Plenty of attacking options - but how will it work?
Gibbs-White's creativity is not in doubt - just ask Nottingham Forest.
Thriving in the No.10 role for his club under Nuno Espirito Santo, he made his England debut last September and contributed seven top-flight goals and eight assists as Forest improved by 10 places on their finishing position in 2024.
He is the club's only player to reach double figures for combined goals and assists in three consecutive Premier League seasons.
Last season, the 25-year-old was involved in 148 attacks that led to an attempt on goal in the Premier League, either through him taking the shot, creating the chance or being involved in the build-up. None of his team-mates came close to matching that tally.
New Spurs head coach Frank will have an abundance of options to play as the central attacking midfielder, with Kudus' preferred position also as a No.10 - despite typically playing out wide for West Ham.
Tottenham, of course, already had James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski in the building for that role, although all four players are versatile.
Across their Premier League careers, it's Maddison who fares best per 90 minutes in terms of goals, assists, shots on target, chances created, through-balls and passes played into the opposition penalty area.
Swede Kulusevski ranks highest for chances created from open play, and also after he's carried the ball a distance of at least five metres.
In short, it remains to be seen how much of an upgrade, if at all, Tottenham's two latest signings would prove to be if given the opportunity in that position.
Are defensive reinforcements still needed?
Spurs' current squad is stacked in attack with Kudus, Maddison, Kulusevski, Wilson Odobert, Manor Solomon and Brennan Johnson.
But Frank's reported interest in Christian Norgaard, before he signed for Arsenal from Brentford, suggests they are also looking for defensive reinforcements in midfield.
They may well be needed. Only the three relegated teams conceded a higher tally of expected goals than Spurs last season, while they also ranked fourth overall for errors leading to shots (41).

Liverpool to commemorate Jota at Preston friendly,Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva will be commemorated with a number of tributes at Liverpool's friendly at Preston North End on Sunday.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn0zegd32nwo,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 11:33:16",Paul Battison,['Liverpool'],"Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva will be commemorated with a number of tributes at Liverpool's friendly at Preston North End on Sunday.
Portugal forward Jota and Silva died in a car crash last week in the Spanish province of Zamora.
Liverpool's match at Deepdale is their first since Jota's passing, which the club described as an ""unimaginable loss"".
There will be a rendition of Liverpool's anthem You'll Never Walk Alone, while Preston captain Ben Whiteman will lay a wreath in front of the away fans.
The Lillywhites will pay pre-match tributes and have created a commemorative edition of the matchday programme.
A minute's silence will be observed alongside televised tributes, with both sets of players wearing black armbands.
The game, which kicks off at 15:00 BST, will also be broadcast live on ITV and LFCTV.
Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for Liverpool, helping them win the FA Cup and League Cup in 2022 and the Premier League title last season.
He played his final match for Portugal as they beat Spain in the final of the Nations League on 8 June. He scored 14 goals in 49 internationals.
The Guardia Civil told BBC Sport that Jota and his brother died after their car, a Lamborghini, left the road due to a tyre blowout while overtaking another vehicle.
The brothers had been heading to the Spanish port of Santander so Jota could return to Liverpool for pre-season training.
Their funeral took place in their hometown of Gondomar, near Porto at the weekend.

Beever-Jones relishing chance to put herself in the picture with Lionesses,Young Chelsea striker is mixing first experience of tournament football with photography hobby and family time in effort to stay focused,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/beever-jones-relishing-chance-to-put-herself-in-the-picture-with-lionesses,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 07:00:05",Suzanne Wrack,['Chelsea'],"Aggie Beever-Jones doesn’t have much tournament experience. The England striker missed out on the 2020 under-17 Euros owing to Covid cancellations and featured at only the under-19s Euros in 2022, where she scored twice in the group stage against Norway, before arriving at Euro 2025.
By the time a player breaks into the senior side they usually have several tournaments under their belt but Covid means Beever-Jones is a part of the generation of young players coming through that lost out.
“I was unfortunate in that sense when I was growing up,” she says. “I’ve never really experienced tournament football and being away from family. It was a crazy time in the world; I think everyone was a bit unsure what was going on. We were lucky enough that football was able to carry on.
“That’s why I think it makes it a bit more special this time round. It is my first proper tournament and at the highest level. It’s exactly where I want to be. I feel comfortable enough to push for my place as well as getting pushed every day to become a better person and player. So I’m really, really enjoying it. Hopefully we can make our mark and keep going.”
The 21-year-old made her senior tournament debut on Wednesday night, coming on in place of Alessia Russo in the 84th minute of England’s 4-0 defeat of the Netherlands, and hopes to play a part on Sunday against Wales. The Chelsea forward’s former manager Emma Hayes spoke of the impact Beever-Jones could have on the international stage at the end of her tenure at the club, saying: “Aggie Beever-Jones. Don’t forget that name. She’s going to be a legend not just for Chelsea but for England.”
Beever-Jones says she feels “extremely lucky” to have achieved her goal of getting to these Euros and reflects on Hayes’ assessment by saying: “For Emma to say those words about me, that probably is one of the best compliments I’ve ever had, and from such an incredible person. I’m just looking to help where I can and enjoy it. I’ve always said I play my best football when I’m enjoying it.”
Making sure you enjoy it off the pitch matters too at a tournament. Taking photos is one of Beever-Jones’s means of distraction. “There’s a few of us,” she says. “I know Alex [Greenwood] bought a camera recently. It’s just nice to find some hobbies outside of football sometimes. The prints are in my journal – got a few Polaroids stuck in there … it’s finding the beauty in the little things and just being able to explore a beautiful city and enjoy it.”
Stepping out of the team bubble to hang out with family and friends also helps. “It’s refreshing to come out of that bubble sometimes and take a step back to spend time with your family and not talk about football,” says Beever-Jones. “My sister’s not a football-head at all so I just talk to her about everything but football. She’s a midwife; I talk a lot to her about her work. She has her boyfriend here who’s equally one of my best friends and it’s just nice to have that relationship. And equally with my mum and dad as well, just spending time and having a general family catchup. It’s a great balance of: you come here, you switch on, we have the bubble, and, equally, you can go out and have a coffee and enjoy time with your family and switch off from football.”
Beever-Jones waits for the chance to make her mark on this tournament and announce herself on the world stage like Alessia Russo and Ella Toone did as England’s super subs in 2022.
“That would be the dream,” she says. “For me, it’s about trusting Sarina [Wiegman] and trusting the process. We have a squad full of incredible players. I just have to take my opportunity when it comes. I was grateful to come on the other day and show a little bit of what I can do. Hopefully I get some more opportunities to do that.”
Was it disheartening not to feature in the opening defeat by France, with Michelle Agyemang the player who came on? “Me and Sarina had a conversation and ultimately I have to respect her decision,” she says. “She did say it was a tough game and she looked elsewhere to bring other people on and I just have to respect that. I know my strengths and I have done it for two years coming off the bench for Chelsea and hopefully making an impact.
“Sarina is well aware of that and I respected that decision. She knows I’ll be ready no matter what, whenever the time comes. I’m just delighted we were able to turn it around the other night. It doesn’t mean anything if we don’t go and beat Wales.”

Liverpool’s mourning players prepare to honour Diogo Jota back on the pitch,Arne Slot’s squad face an emotional afternoon at Preston on Sunday but believe it is better to start again at Deepdale than on tour in Hong Kong,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/liverpools-mourning-players-prepare-to-honour-diogo-jota-back-on-the-pitch,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 07:00:05",Andy Hunter,['Liverpool'],"Outside Anfield, the red sea of tributes to Diogo Jota and André Silva has continued to grow this week along with questions over whether Liverpool could play at Preston on Sunday, their first game since the brothers’ tragic loss. Inside Anfield, and specifically a grieving Liverpool dressing room, there was no major debate over the pre-season friendly. The Premier League champions intend to honour their teammate in the best way they know how.
It will be only 10 days since the deaths of Jota and Silva when Liverpool appear at Deepdale for what is certain to be a hugely emotional occasion, and less than two days since the club retired Jota’s No 20 shirt. There was no pressure on Liverpool to honour a friendly that could have been cancelled easily – unlike their commitment to a tour of Hong Kong and Japan at the end of the month – but at no point was that option relayed to Preston.
Delaying a first appearance since the accident until they play Milan in Hong Kong on 26 July or Yokohama F. Marinos at the Nissan Stadium four days later was not considered a suitable alternative by Liverpool’s players. The consensus was to get out and play, albeit while being acutely aware of how difficult the first stepswill be.
Their reactions to hearing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off on Sunday and seeing tributes to Jota and Silva at Deepdale will be broadcast live. ITV agreed a deal in principle to televise the game last month and finalised the decision days before the brothers were killed in north-western Spain.
Those at Deepdale and watching on television will be witnessing a club in mourning, to use the words of Liverpool’s chief executive, Billy Hogan. The past week, said Hogan, “has been just absolutely devastating”. The club are also having to balance the professional obligations of preparing for a new season with the personal tragedy that has enveloped players, coaches and staff. They have lost a much-loved friend at the age of 28 and someone who was a positive, vocal presence in the dressing room. Jota was a player who managed to enforce standards at Liverpool while lifting the atmosphere.
The new signings Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and Giorgi Mamardashvili were due to report for the usual pre-season tests last Friday, with their teammates starting back from Tuesday onwards, but all football-related activity was placed on hold once the deaths of Jota and Silva were confirmed. Some did report on Tuesday but the full squad were not reunited at the training ground until the end of this week, having been given time to process an unimaginable loss. It is one that some may never process.
Sombre training sessions have been followed by visits to the mass of bouquets and scarves left in tribute to Jota and Silva behind the main stand at Anfield. The whole first team attended the scene on Friday in the company of Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, and parents, Isabel and Joaquim. Andy Robertson, one of Jota’s closest friends at the club, had led the way earlier in the week with his tribute to “MacJota”, so called by the Scotland captain given the striker’s love of darts, horse racing and British life. The former players Steven Gerrard and Adam Lallana were also among the thousands who have paid their respects at Anfield.
Arne Slot and his wife, Mirjam, also left an emotional tribute and took time to read many of the messages on 97 Avenue. “Diogo, we had the same dream and we fulfilled it together. André and yourself will for ever be in our hearts,” read the tribute from the Slot family. Jota’s character, along with his ability as a footballer, were eloquently captured in a message from Michael Edwards, the chief executive of football at Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, who oversaw Jota’s £41m move from Wolves in 2020. “Down to earth, determined, a great finisher and, above all, loved and respected by all who knew him,” Edwards wrote. “He gave everything to the team, with quiet strength and unwavering humility. His impact reached far beyond the pitch.”
Luis Díaz and Alisson returned to pre-season training on Merseyside via Jota’s home city of Gondomar, near Porto. The Liverpool forward and goalkeeper were unable to attend the brothers’ funeral on Saturday because they were in Colombia and Brazil respectively. However, along with some of Jota’s Portugal teammates including Rúben Neves, José Sá and Diogo Costa, and the Penafiel team that Silva played for, they attended a seventh-day mass in memory of the siblings at the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar on Wednesday. Players who had extended international commitments this summer are unlikely to be considered for Sunday’s game.
Liverpool and Preston will pay several tributes to Jota and Silva at Deepdale. The home team will lay a wreath close to the Liverpool fans, there will be a rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone and a minute’s silence before kick-off, and both sets of players will wear black armbands. Fans had called for Liverpool to retire the No 20 shirt and the club did so after consulting his family.
Hogan said after paying his respects outside Anfield on Wednesday: “I think the most important thing in this process is that we want to make sure we are respecting the family … Obviously they have gone through an unimaginable situation over the course of the last several days. We certainly will, obviously, remember both André and Diogo.”

Ambitious Chelsea will not park bus despite challenge of full-throttle PSG,Club World Cup final features two youth-driven teams but Enzo Maresca’s side believe they can hurt favourites,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/ambitious-chelsea-will-not-park-bus-despite-challenge-of-full-throttle-psg,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 07:01:03",Jacob Steinberg,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea', 'Liverpool', 'Manchester City']","Chelsea have already made over £80m from their Club World Cup adventure but they can achieve something priceless against Paris Saint-Germain. This goes beyond gaudy gold badges and money in the bank. The season with no end is almost over, the final of the tournament that nobody asked for is here and while Chelsea have no intention of getting carried away if they triumph in New Jersey on Sunday it is also the case that there would be no better way to demonstrate that they are on to something with their youth-driven project than by beating Luis Enrique’s awesome PSG.
Easier said than done, of course. One school of thought is that Chelsea will have done well if they leave the MetLife Stadium with their dignity intact. Premier League opponents hold no fears for PSG, whose path to Champions League glory was paved by wins over Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal, while they were in terrifying form against Real Madrid on Wednesday. It finished 4-0, but it could have been 10; PSG really were that good and the reality is there will only be one outcome if they hit those heights again.
A free hit for Chelsea, then? They have made plenty of cash from the tournament, boosting their profitability and sustainability position. They have answered questions about their mentality by coming through a series of challenges. Clear evidence of progress means Chelsea face the European champions able to resist the temptation to judge themselves on one big game.
Chelsea aim to be sustainable. That means maintaining a steady temperament no matter what happens against PSG. It is worth going back to the club finishing 12th in their first season under the ownership of Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. The criticism was fierce and sustained. The perception was of a chaotic institution.
Yet Chelsea stuck with the strategy implemented in January 2023 and continued to buy more young players. They know that they have made mistakes along the way – there is no appetite for any more mid-season managerial changes – but there is satisfaction with how they have not deviated from their chosen path.
Replacing Mauricio Pochettino, whose approach did not suit the squad, with the more technical but more inexperienced Enzo Maresca last summer? “It’s much more about tactics,” Malo Gusto, the Chelsea right-back, said of the change from Maresca to Pochettino. “That’s why we are in the final – it’s because of him.”
Chelsea laugh at the narrative about needing older players. They won the Conference League last season and are back in the Champions League. They appear to have bought well this summer and are pleased with the recruitment team of Paul Winstanley, Laurence Stewart, Sam Jewell and Joe Shields.
It was noted before the tournament that results will follow if you put the right strategies in place and build patiently. Chelsea have invested in data and scouting. It cannot be a coincidence that they are the second-youngest team at the Club World Cup. The youngest? PSG. A source suggests that PSG and Chelsea have given other clubs a model to follow. “Aggressive, fresh teams,” is the observation. Another is that Chelsea were signing young players long before PSG adopted the model.
PSG are further along in their development, though. Having a dash of experience in key areas surely helps while they also have the more established coach.
Chelsea met with Luis Enrique after sacking Graham Potter in April 2023, only to go with Pochettino. Hindsight is a funny thing. It is not easy to know how a foreign coach will adapt to the Premier League. Luis Enrique had just come off a disappointing World Cup with Spain. It is not rewriting history to say his stock was not as high as it is now; that he had dipped since winning the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015.
In any case Chelsea are happy with Maresca’s first year in charge. They are adapting to his positional-based style and play with a clear idea. “Most people expect PSG to win but we don’t think that,” Levi Colwill said on Friday. “When you play for Chelsea you’re not scared to play against anyone. I think they’ll be looking at our forwards and know it’s not going to be easy.”
The centre-back acknowledged that dealing with the ferocity and immediacy of PSG’s press will not be easy. Do Chelsea play out of the back regardless? “You have to respect how they press but we’re not going to change our whole way to play them,” Colwill said. “We’ve got this far playing our football so why are we going to change that now?”
Everyone has a plan until Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué and Kvara Kvaratskhelia run at them, though. The feeling is that Maresca has no intention of parking the bus; that betraying his identity for one game would be folly. Still, though, Chelsea have to box clever. Do Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo need an extra body in midfield to deal with João Neves, Vitinha and Fabián Ruiz? Can Chelsea beat the press if Roméo Lavia is out? How to contain Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes’s surges from full-back? Colwill noted the heat in New Jersey, saying it cannot become a basketball game.
But Chelsea have their weapons. They have Cole Palmer and the counterattacking threat of Pedro Neto and Liam Delap. João Pedro scored two stunners against Fluminense; Fernández and Caicedo are in sparkling form.
Speaking at a Fifa technical briefing on Thursday, Roberto Martínez noted that the best way to play PSG is to go man to man, to hit the triggers required to exploit the high line. Bayern Munich caused them problems in the quarter-final. They still lost, though. The issue is that the press has to be perfect. PSG can rip through at will.
Chelsea know they are facing the best team in the world. PSG were supreme against Inter in the Champions League final. Logic suggests this one should only go one way. Chelsea have other ideas. Imagine how they would feel going into next season as world champions. Chelsea have no plans to change course but beating PSG would give the project immense validation.
Chelsea will be underdogs against PSG and will be without Noni Madueke, who has left the camp to complete a £52m move to Arsenal. Bournemouth have agreed a £25m deal to sign the Serbian goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic and Milan are interested in Nicolas Jackson but are unlikely to be able to afford the striker.
“Noni is in contact with a new club,” Maresca said. “I said in one of the last press conferences that if players want to leave it’s difficult for the club and for the manager. Noni decided to leave. Nobody told Noni he had to leave. If he is happy, we are happy.”
Lavia was absent from training on Friday and it remains to be seen if Caicedo has shaken off an ankle injury. “ Moisés is such an important player for us,” Maresca said.“This morning he trained but he couldn’t take part in the session fully. We hope he can play on Sunday.”
Maresca bristled at the idea that Chelsea will have to suffer and endure long spells without the ball.
“Who said that?” the Italian said. “We’ll see in two days. For sure they are a top team, the best team in the world. Every game is different. We are going to try our best for a good game.”

Luis Enrique shrugs off praise for PSG’s season with Club World Cup final to come,Paris Saint-Germain coach cautious of difficult game against Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/12/luis-enrique-shrugs-off-praise-for-psgs-season-with-club-world-cup-final-to-come,"Sat, 12 Jul 2025 01:14:40",Sid Lowe,"['Chelsea', 'Manchester City']","There is just one game left in the season in which Paris Saint-Germain finally won the first Champions League in their history to complete a historic treble and that game is the Club World Cup final, but Luis Enrique says it has not been his best. He was better, he claims, when he lost. Besides, the PSG coach said, Manchester City remain the best team around and his side must face a Chelsea team he likened to his own which can still deny them the perfect campaign and have a manager he “loves”.
“The Champions League was our first and it was very important: that was our main objective when we came to Paris last year,” Enrique said. “And on Sunday we have the chance, with the last game of the season, to win another one, with the Club World Cup. But it is important that we are conscious of the difficulty of the game. [Enzo] Maresca is a coach I love. I love the way he has of playing with the ball. They have a lot of good individual platers but they also have a real sense of duty. They are a bit like our team. They are physically strong too. It will be a very even game and a very difficult one.
“Chelsea won the Conference League, they finished fourth in the league, they are growing a lot. They have great players, technical players, and a great coach who I like a lot because of how they try to play from deep, always press, always want to attack. They are a very complete team that has produced a sensational season. This is no easy team and it is not a formality or anything like it. We will approach it 100% focused to try to round off a historic season.
“Was it our best season? Maybe, but we have to win to complete it. Anyway, you go a final and there is a loser and there is a winner too, but that doesn’t mean the loser has done badly. We will give 100% and see which prize we get.
“A team is 11 stars, that’s football,” the PSG coach continued. “We don’t want one, we want 11, or 13, 14, 15 … that is what we want. We are looking for the real star to be the entire team. It’s like the fans: there is not one star, it is the whole of the Parc des Princes. I think the path is clear for everyone. We want stars, but at the service of the team.”
It was then put to him that the star was him, and that he was the favourite to win the Ballon d’Or coach’s award.
“I don’t believe in individual awards in general and still less for a coach,” he replied. “The team is always above the individual and that is something we try to transmit at PSG. Ousmane [Dembélé] is the best for what he has done individually, for the goals and assists, but above the goals and the assists it is because his work has meant that PSG won all the trophies. And that should be the only criteria by which a player is rewarded individually. That’s my opinion, and I am sure there are others.
“There is nothing star about me. There wasn’t as a player and there isn’t as a coach. I like the work I do. I enjoyed my career as a player and I am enjoying it as a coach – especially the hard moments. That’s when I feel most happy. It is nice when things go well because in our job you can make a lot of people happy, and I have learned to appreciate that as the years passed.
“But I know how this ‘show’ works: I know that people think you are good or bad based on your results. The praise comes because you win. The best team over the last decade was Manchester City. They lose 10 games and everyone kills them. They still have the best coach, they’re still the best team. It’s incredible.
“I accept that. But I have been better when I lost. I don’t mind; I like being criticised more than being praised. I think I have got it right much more when I didn’t win and everyone killed me with criticism. You all think that because we’re winning, I am getting everything right now. No. I got it right much more, I did much better, when I lost. But in terms of efficiency it has been an extraordinary year and now we have to finish it off.”

Morgan Gibbs-White move to Spurs on hold as Nottingham Forest consider legal action,Forest also preparing complaint to Premier League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/11/morgan-gibbs-white-spurs-move-on-hold-nottingham-forest-consider-legal-action-alleged-illegal-approach,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 12:59:33",Ben Fisher,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Morgan Gibbs-White’s expected £60m move to Tottenham is on hold because Nottingham Forest are considering legal action over an alleged illegal approach for the player.
Forest are also preparing a complaint to the Premier League, arguing that Spurs’ conduct surrounding the proposed transfer has been inappropriate. It had been expected that Gibbs-White would have a medical on Friday before completing the move.
Forest are consulting lawyers about possible legal action because they believe they have not granted Spurs permission to speak with Gibbs-White and also feel there has been a breach in confidentiality regarding the release clause in the England midfielder’s contract.
Spurs, who signed Mohammed Kudus from West Ham on Thursday, still plan to proceed with the deal as they look to boost Thomas Frank’s squad. This summer they have also tracked the Crystal Palace and England midfielder Eberechi Eze, who is wanted by their rivals Arsenal, Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo and Southampton’s Tyler Dibling. Forest and Tottenham declined to comment when contacted. Forest consider the deal to be off but their anger may delay and not prevent the move.

Jordan Henderson will sign for Brentford next week after Ajax exit,England international will join on a two-year deal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/11/jordan-henderson-poised-to-bolster-brentford-midfield-after-ajax-exit,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:50:02",Nick Ames,['Arsenal'],"Jordan Henderson’s return to the Premier League with Brentford will be confirmed next week after the England midfielder agreed a two-year contract with the Bees.
The 35-year-old, who ended a sometimes turbulent spell at Ajax this month, will fill the void left by Christian Nørgaard in a much-changed Brentford setup. Nørgaard, who had been the club’s captain, joined Arsenal this week and the expectation is that Henderson’s experience will be critical to the revamped engine room.
It means Henderson will add to his 431 top-flight appearances two years after leaving Liverpool and joining the Saudi club Al-Ettifaq. That transfer sparked controversy owing to a perceived clash with his high-profile support of LGBTQ+ rights. His spell there lasted only six months, an early contract termination allowing him to join Ajax in January 2024.
Magpies swoop for Elanga
Anthony Elanga has finally completed his move to Newcastle after the Magpies refused to give up their dogged pursuit.
The 23-year-old Sweden international has signed a long-term deal after the Tyneside club agreed an undisclosed fee with Nottingham Forest to secure the winger’s services.
Elanga, who was a target for Eddie Howe last summer, will join international teammate Alexander Isak at St James’ Park as his new employers prepare for a season which will include a return to Champions League football.
The Newcastle manager Howe told the club's website: “I’m delighted to welcome Anthony to Newcastle. He has been a key target for us so I’m delighted to secure him at this early part of pre-season.
“He is an exciting talent with attributes that make him a unique attacking threat. His pace, energy and ability to create and score goals will strengthen us and complement the way we want to play.
“Anthony is hungry to develop even further with us and to achieve success here and we’re all looking forward to working with him.”
Elanga, who began his career at Manchester United, has prospered since his £15m switch to Forest during the summer of 2023.
Elanga said: “I’m excited, I’m really happy but most importantly I’m ready. I’m ready to put on this black and white top to really fight for this team and give everything for the passionate fanbase that lives and breathes football.""

Henderson captained Ajax but they dramatically missed out on last season’s Eredivisie title and he received criticism early this year after claims he was seeking a move to Monaco. Although contracted to the Amsterdam club until next summer, they agreed to release him and facilitate his move back to England.
He is the latest player to join Brentford in a summer of change that has seen Keith Andrews step up to replace the Spurs-bound Thomas Frank as head coach. The goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who joined in June, will be a familiar face from Henderson’s Liverpool days. There is considerable doubt over whether Bryan Mbeumo, a long-term target of Manchester United, will remain among his teammates when next season begins.
Henderson may hope that renewed Premier League exposure enhances his chances of a call-up to next summer’s World Cup squad. He has won 84 caps for England and, after missing out on Euro 2024, was recalled by Thomas Tuchel for the March qualifiers against Albania and Latvia. Those appearances from the bench were followed by a start in last month’s narrow win over Andorra.
Last week Henderson was among the many friends and teammates to pay emotional tributes outside Anfield to Diogo Jota, the Liverpool forward who was tragically killed in a car accident in Spain.

Athletic Bilbao’s Álvarez blames hair loss medicine for provisional doping suspension,Footballer revealed details in social media post,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/11/athletic-bilbao-yeray-alvarez-blames-hair-loss-medicine-doping-test-suspension,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 09:37:30",Athletic Bilbao,['Manchester United'],"Athletic Bilbao’s Yeray Álvarez has been provisionally suspended because of a failed doping test after a Europa League game against Manchester United, with the defender saying he unintentionally ingested a banned substance in medicine used to treat hair loss.
Álvarez said he had tested positive after Bilbao’s 3-0 home defeat in the semi-finals of Uefa’s second-tier club competition in May. The Spanish side also lost the return leg 4-1.
The 30-year-old centre-back was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2016 and said he had been taking the medicine as part of his treatment for alopecia.
“After studying the case, we have established that I tested positive because I unintentionally took a hair loss prevention medicine containing a banned substance,” Álvarez said in a social media post on Thursday.
“The disciplinary procedure is currently under investigation and subject to confidentiality, so I am provisionally suspended and am not authorised to make any further public statements.
“I would like to say to all of you that I very much regret this situation but, with the support of the club, I am working on my defence in the belief that I will be able to return to the field of play as soon as possible.”
Uefa said it would not comment on the case until a final disciplinary decision had been made.
Bilbao threw their full support behind Álvarez, who came through the club’s youth academy and has made 257 appearances in all competitions for the senior team.

Sign up now!,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/11/arsene-wenger-club-world-cup-chelsea-psg-football-daily-newsletter,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:29:07",Niall McVeigh,"['Arsenal', 'Chelsea', 'Liverpool']","ARSÈNE KNOWS?
The inaugural Copa Gianni jamboree reaches its end game on Sunday as Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, two lavishly-backed super clubs based a short Eurostar trip apart, battle to be kings of the global game. PSG have undermined their rivals’ complaints about packed schedules and player fatigue by flying in after Bigger Cup final and destroying better-rested teams. Chelsea, meanwhile, have benefited from a tournament that allows you to simply buy more players as you go – including those on opposing teams – in order to freshen things up. Whatever happens, football will be the winner, but has Copa Gianni been any good?
Asked at the end of June, Jürgen Klopp was unequivocal in his criticism, calling it the worst idea ever implemented in football (and it has some serious competition – Football Daily Ed). Almost two weeks later, Arsène Wenger has bitten back. “I am going to give a very boring answer to a very interesting question,” Wenger told salivating hacks. “Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I don’t share the view of Klopp at all.” With a full fortnight to prepare his riposte, we were expecting a Bielsa-esque PowerPoint takedown, but instead got the kind of unsubstantiated guff that may have earned Wenger the gig as Fifa’s chief of global football development. “If you make enquiries to all the clubs who were here, 100% [would say] they would want to do it again.”
If by clubs, Wenger means the boardroom bean-counters and PSR plate-spinners who oversee things, he may be right. But what about managers, so often the public face of the team? We would ask Botafogo’s Renato Paiva and Porto’s Martín Anselmi what they thought, but they were both sacked for their Copa Gianni failures (which, in Paiva’s case, included beating PSG). How did Pep Guardiola enjoy Manchester City’s daring run to the last 16? “Maybe [in winter] it will be a disaster, we are exhausted and [Copa Gianni] has destroyed us,” trilled Guardiola. Well, at least his players enjoyed it, right? “My teammates are not exactly overjoyed about the tournament,” said Manuel Akanji, who joined the rest of City’s back line in downing tools against Al-Hilal.
Wenger also took on the issue of low fan turnout, saying “we believe the attendances were projected as low and in reality were much higher,” while squinting up at an empty stand as invisible to him as a contentious decision in Arsenal’s favour. “We shouldn’t underestimate the quality of the permanent pitches,” he added, rubbing a scorched blade of grass between forefinger and thumb. “The grass is a bit harsher here. The pitches were flat. But once we watered the grass, everyone was happy.” Apart from PSG’s Luis Enrique, of course, who complained of playing surfaces “full of holes” that made the ball “jump around like a rabbit”.
And what about the heat, which made it “almost impossible to train,” according to Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca? Well, it turns out he was doing the training wrong. “I asked our analysts to analyse the impact of the heat,” Wenger added, while stuffing party packs of ice cubes inside his extra-long puffer jacket. “We found heat of over 35C had an impact on high-speed running, so sprints, not distances.” So, it’s simple – to succeed in this tournament, or next year’s Stay Away World Cup, players need to stop running. After all it’s not like this is an elite competitive sport, right? Wenger’s verdict may be good news for Cole Palmer, but it also proves the Copa Gianni – recently described as a “wake-up call” for player welfare – is a marathon, not a sprint.

Football transfer rumours: Bayern to sign Luis Díaz after new bid?,Today’s guff has attacking flair,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/11/football-transfer-rumours-bayern-munich-liverpool-newcastle-nottingham-forest,"Fri, 11 Jul 2025 08:31:53",David Tindall,['Liverpool'],"Bayern Munich clearly had the hump when Florian Wirtz was lured to Liverpool rather than Bavaria. So after missing out on the former Bayer Leverkusen playmaker, are they trying to exact a spot of revenge by snatching Luis Díaz from the Reds? Latest reports from Germany suggest Bayern have upped their efforts with a £52m offer for the 28-year-old, and that new talks have taken place between Díaz’s representatives and Bayern Munich’s director of sport, Max Eberl.
Liverpool aren’t having any of it, hinting they would consider letting the Colombian go only if a significant offer arrived; £52m doesn’t fall into that category. The player himself has suggested he is open to an “exciting offer” but that may just be to improve his contract at Anfield. And that’s rather a sticking point: scroll down the list of Liverpool players’ wages and he’s surprisingly low but there appears to be no sign of an increase on the table.
While Darwin Núñez (on more than double Díaz’s wages) continues to be linked with a move to Italian champions Napoli, the big fish for Liverpool’s transfer rod is still Alexander Isak. And maybe Arne Slot’s champions have received some encouragement for a raid on the striker with news from the transfer guru Fabrizio Romano that Newcastle have joined the race to sign the Eintracht Frankfurt frontman Hugo Ekitike.
The 23-year-old, rated at about £85m, has attracted interest from the Saudi Pro League and various Premier League clubs, including Liverpool (this thing goes in never-ending circles, doesn’t it) and Chelsea. But the belief is that he wants to stay in Europe and Newcastle would certainly have the wonga if they sold Isak to Liverpool – even if it would go down like a piece of Ikea furniture with a vital screw missing if they sold the Swede to a Premier League rival.
It’s all happening at Nottingham Forest and not in a good way in many respects. With the winger Anthony Elanga lined up to join Newcastle and the chief string-puller, Morgan Gibbs-White, set for a medical at Tottenham, Forest are in danger of seeing their squad pulled apart after an excellent 2024-25 campaign in which they flirted heavily with a Champions League place before finally finishing seventh.
But news of incomings will boost spirits and one well-known Premier League frontman being heavily linked again is Brentford’s Yoane Wissa. Forest are believed to have had a £25m bid rejected out of hand last winter. Brentford want double that and perhaps the budget is there now for Nuno Espírito Santo to bring in the Congolese international.
The Wissa deal – Spurs have also shown interest – is complicated by the saga of Bryan Mbeumo’s proposed switch to Manchester United. It’s a saga being played out in public and so slow moving that Rio Ferdinand has claimed on his Youtube channel that if it doesn’t come off “it would be a custard, egg on your face situation”. And it doesn’t get any worse than that. Brentford don’t want to lose both players so this may take a fair while to be resolved yet.
Back to Forest and they’re reportedly trying to fill their Gibbs-White-shaped hole with Manchester City midfielder James McAtee. The 22-year-old has just captained England Under-21s to Euros glory, which might have put a few quid on his transfer fee. That, by the way, is a bone of contention. Forest are believed to be offering £25m but City want something north of £40m. West Ham are also sniffing, having just sold Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham.
And finally, talking of Spurs, Thomas Frank seems to be piecing together a new squad rather nicely and there could be a fresh arrival in defence too. Attracting attention is the Belgian centre-back Koni De Winter. The Genoa defender enjoyed an excellent season in Serie A and could be prized away for £25m-£30m. Inevitably, Inter and other Italian clubs are also monitoring the situation.
