Are Chelsea Premier League title contenders?,"Chelsea qualified for the Champions League, won the Conference League and became Club World Cup champions in Enzo Maresca's first season in charge.",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13396589/are-chelsea-premier-league-title-contenders-enzo-marescas-side-thriving-after-club-world-cup-success,"Sat, 16 Aug 2025 18:16:00",,['Chelsea'],"Chelsea qualified for the Champions League, won the Conference League and became Club World Cup champions in Enzo Maresca's first season in charge.
Can they now launch a Premier League title challenge?
Sky Sports' Paul Merson reckons Maresca's young squad won't have the consistency.
""It was an amazing achievement for Chelsea to win the Club World Cup. I didn't see it happening. They were outstanding in that final against Paris Saint-Germain,"" he said.
""It's silverware, which you cannot turn your nose up at, plus there are financial benefits which have helped in the transfer market. However, you can't get carried away.
""Winning the Premier League is a totally different ball game to winning the Club World Cup. It will be difficult for Chelsea to challenge for the Premier League title this season.
""Winning that summer tournament doesn't particularly change anything for me. You need unreal consistency to go all the way in the league and with Chelsea's young squad, I don't see them having that this year. There are no easy games in the Premier League and you have to bring your best week in, week out.
""Champions League qualification again, and potentially another cup win, has to be the target.""
But there are reasons to be hopeful...
Chelsea fans turned against Maresca at half-time of their fixture at Fulham in April.
Having won only once in their previous four games, their Champions League hopes were fading until Tyrique George and Pedro Neto produced a dramatic late turnaround. It proved to be the turning point of their season.
Chelsea won 13 of their final 15 matches with Maresca tweaking his system and also experimenting at the Club World Cup by using every outfield player.
Reece James has played alongside Moises Caicedo in midfield, allowing Enzo Fernandez to thrive further forward.
Full-backs Marc Cucurella and Malo Gusto stayed wide at the Club World Cup rather than coming into the middle and Cole Palmer shone playing on the right wing rather than behind the striker.
It was also noticeable how often Chelsea played longer against PSG, bypassing their trademark press, and using their pace and power to get up the pitch.
Maresca's possession style has turned exciting.
Chelsea came unstuck when Nicolas Jackson injured his hamstring midway through last season. Christopher Nkunku was unable to fill the void and winger Pedro Neto had to play as a striker. Palmer's drastic drop in form coincided with their sticky run too.
They won't have the same forward issues next season. The additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap have shown a statement of intent that the club wants to compete on all fronts.
The trio scored 32 goals between them in the Premier League last season. The bigger issue will be keeping them both happy with regular playing time.
Robert Sanchez was jeered by Chelsea fans at times last season when he had the ball at his feet. His five errors leading to goals, the joint-most in the Premier League, didn't cost Chelsea a Champions League spot but left most thinking he needed to be replaced.
""I can't see someone winning the Premier League with that goalkeeper and without a standout centre-back,"" said Jamie Carragher in December. He followed it up a month later by saying Sanchez is a goalkeeper for a ""bottom-half"" club.
Chelsea walked away from signing AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan before the Club World Cup, which appeared to lift Sanchez ahead of the tournament.
The 27-year-old kept four clean sheets, shining in the final with six saves to earn the Golden Glove and his accurate long kicking troubled PSG on the counter-attack. This could be a turning point in his Chelsea career, but Merson isn't so sure.
""He's a great shot stopper. It's very rare you talk about him letting one through him,"" said Merson. ""He's superb at that aspect of the game, it's just his decision-making that lets him down sometimes.
""That will be the problem over the course of the season.""
Todd Boehly now has something to show for his £1.5bn spending at Chelsea.
A Champions League place, a Conference League trophy and a Club World Cup triumph have laid Gary Neville's iconic line to rest.
Chelsea are looking the real deal with a young squad that has quickly inherited the club's trophy-winning mentality.
The estimated £111m in Club World Cup prize money will help to balance the books too.
More work is needed in the transfer window with Merson reckoning an experienced centre-back is a priority.
""They need that experience to go with the good options they have,"" said Merson. ""It's not a lot that Chelsea really needs, but that there is the most important parts in a football team, especially when you are talking about winning leagues.""
The fixture computer has handed Chelsea a favourable start to the season, beginning at home to Crystal Palace on August 17, live on Sky Sports.
West Ham, Fulham and Brentford follow before they head out of London for the first time when they visit Manchester United.
Chelsea also have the second-best set of fixtures following mid-week European matches of the nine Premier League sides involved.
They'll play away from home just twice, against Manchester United and Crystal Palace, travelling only 341 miles after playing in the Champions League.
But how will they recover from a 64-game season that finally ended in July? They impressed in their two pre-season games, beating Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan, but will just three weeks of training be enough?

Will Man City regret letting another academy star go in McAtee?,"""I need him. That's why I want to keep him.""",https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13384539/james-mcatee-manchester-city-may-regret-letting-academy-product-leave-after-cole-palmer-and-morgan-rogers-mistakes,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 08:00:00",Sam Blitz,['Manchester City'],"""I need him. That's why I want to keep him.""
Pep Guardiola promised a big season - and a big future - for James McAtee when he started him in Manchester City's Community Shield last August. A year later, he is no longer in the City picture.
The 22-year-old academy graduate has left to join Nottingham Forest in a deal worth around £30m. Big money for a big talent who just could not find a spot in the squad.
City have been here before, though. They had a youngster by the name of Cole Palmer - who had roughly the same number of Premier League minutes in his final City season before leaving for Chelsea. In that similar amount of time, you could even say McAtee's attacking output was better.
Like Palmer, McAtee did well to find the net in his brief City cameos but was never backed consistently on the biggest stage. The parallels go even further - Palmer was a key player at England's U21 European Championship-winning team in his final summer as a City player. This year, McAtee was captain of Lee Carsley's champions at the same tournament - just two years later.
Given how Palmer rose to fame at Chelsea, winning the Premier League Young Player of the Season award in his debut campaign at Stamford Bridge, Guardiola may feel uncomfortable letting another similar type of play go - especially considering what he said about him last summer.
""I said to Txiki Begiristain [City's former sporting director] in the beginning of the season, I don't want to loan him or sell him,"" added Guardiola after that Community Shield start.
""When you find a player in small spaces that attack the final third, have a sense of goal, it's difficult to find players of this quality.""
That feeling on McAtee is shared by those who developed him. ""Pep always references how good he is in pockets,"" Brian Barry-Murphy, Manchester City's former youth coach and now Cardiff City's new boss, tells Sky Sports.
""What's the most significant thing about James McAtee? The tighter the spaces, the more at home and comfortable he is. He's a very specific player in that role.""
As City's Elite Development Squad head coach, Barry-Murphy grouped Palmer, McAtee and Oscar Bobb together as three players who could ""do things with the ball that I've never seen before"". Yet the three of them feel or felt like the bridesmaids of Guardiola's affections, rather than the main attraction.
Bobb was tipped for a breakout season in the one just gone before a long-term ankle injury kept him out for nearly the entire campaign. He is back in the fold now but even then, City invested in Savinho for Bobb's right-wing role, highlighting the challenge of trying to break through when the club can just sign the world’s best young players for that area.
That is the main issue for City's youngsters. Despite having one of the best academies in the world, they are also blessed with financially strong owners ready to flood the first team with Europe's best talent.
McAtee found that out before his departure. Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki were signed in the attacking midfield position this summer for a combined £80m, while even teenage midfielder Sverre Nypan has been invested in that position for a further £12.5m.
For City youngsters like Palmer and McAtee, it has created a sink-or-swim surroundings that very few - Phil Foden and Rico Lewis being the only academy examples - have managed to thrive in when it comes to City’s first team.
""Because this City team is so dominant and so good, even if it seems like a big step up, you can do well and survive there and do well for a period,"" adds Barry-Murphy.
""But then you either come back out or you stay in there and become established. That's the challenge of how actually good you are.""
But Palmer has proved he is good enough, only elsewhere. He is not the only City academy product to do that.
City let Morgan Rogers depart for Middlesbrough for just £1m - then watched him move to Aston Villa, who could have taken City's Champions League spot off them. Rogers even scored the winning goal against City at Villa Park last season.
City also allowed Liam Delap to join Ipswich for £20m last summer; he is now linking up with Palmer at Chelsea. Both of them helped City beat Chelsea to the Club World Cup trophy this summer.
The Delap case was a more understandable one. He was never going to outmuscle Erling Haaland out of a City starting spot during his prime years.
But the cases of Palmer, Rogers and now McAtee require more justification - especially given how the club will likely have been planning for how to succeed Kevin de Bruyne as soon as the Belgian hit his 30s three years ago.
Some will justifiably point out that City's academy has been a good resource for doing exactly that: buying the best players in the world.
Last summer, academy sales hit the £500m total since Guardiola's arrival in Manchester - not just due to selling the likes of Palmer and Co, but also installing substantial sell-on clauses so City would benefit from their next move. City cannot justify signing the best without selling their best.
But City's boy infamously became Chelsea's man with Palmer. Delap can do the same next season, adding to what Rogers has already done.
There can be huge advantages to having a solid academy, but if enough of them aren't trusted, City have proved that enough of them will come back to haunt you. Time will tell if McAtee is one of those players.

Why Arsenal are ready to win the league as stakes rise for Arteta,The additions of midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres show Arsenal's ambition in what will be Mikel Arteta's most important season as manager.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd7y29lzj1lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 06:43:51",Alex Howell,['Arsenal'],"This season is set to be the most important in Mikel Arteta's five and a half years in charge of Arsenal.
They have revamped their squad with £190m worth of signings as they look to win the Premier League for the first time in 21 years.
The Gunners have finished second for the past three seasons in a row but have now made a big push over the summer to end that drought.
Arsenal have added two important cogs to the spine of their team with the signing of midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres.
Here, BBC Sport looks at why Arsenal - who begin their campaign away to Manchester United on Sunday (kick-off 16:30 BST) - believe they are now ready to win the league this season.
How have Arsenal strengthened over the summer?
Speaking before the first summer match in Singapore, Arteta said he ""sees the right balance"" and that ""all the ingredients are there"" for Arsenal to win this season.
The addition of six new players and the potential of another has given fans a lift, but also raised expectations.
The added depth in the squad has given Arteta a real boost and the possibility of lots of variations in his team as he looks to break down stubborn defences.
Declan Rice looks to have been permanently released into the more advanced midfield role he excelled in so much last season, thanks to the arrival of Zubimendi from Real Sociedad.
Arteta has also got rid of the 'tier system' so there is no drop off in the team. Tier One players were expected starters but the new signings have been brought in to make sure that there is not a huge dip in performance if any of the starting XI are unavailable.
There has been a big emphasis on increasing the goal threat from every position this summer - using runs in behind and getting shots off - and on how to get the best out of Gykores' key attributes after the striker scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for Portuguese side Sporting.
Arteta said if you leave Gyokeres ""with the space one against one, he's going to destroy you"" earlier this summer.
He added: ""He's going to create a lot of space as well for us and there is the moment that, in any situation, there is a player there that can score a goal.""
What happens if they don't win?
It will not be a shock to Arteta that fans are expecting trophies at Emirates Stadium this season.
During crunch matches during the last campaign you could feel the desperation from the crowd to see success.
The Arsenal boss has had his fair share of critics, who have questioned his ability to win trophies given he has only won the FA Cup and that was in his first season as manager.
There were even messages of 'Arteta out' sprayed on walls near the stadium after the signing of Noni Madueke, which shows that some supporters may not have as much patience as most in the stadium.
Whatever happens, Arteta has given himself a squad with more quality and with players at the right age who are ready to make the next step - but pressure could come from within if Arsenal don't get over the line after their summer spending.
What have we seen in pre-season?
Arsenal know they are expected to compete in multiple competitions this season and the players and staff are not scared of saying they need to win a trophy.
Different versions of the phrase 'getting to a new level' were used by Arteta and others throughout pre-season, with signs mentioning similar at the team's kit launch on a rooftop in Singapore.
Arteta does not like the word friendlies and sees the games they have played before the start of the Premier League season as ""tests"".
The intensity and sharpness was noted by opponents and the evolution of the Arsenal side could be seen from the first game against AC Milan.
Arsenal started with Ethan Nwaneri in a central role which seems to be the strongest area of Arsenal's squad this season with Rice, Zubimendi, Christian Norgaard, Martin Odegaard and Mikel Merino also options.
Madueke has been signed from Chelsea to play on the wings, a position where Nwaneri broke into the side, but he is a natural midfielder and his pathway into the team seems to be there.
One of the key takeaways from Arsenal from their five summer matches is a more direct approach.
The Gunners scored 17 fewer goals than Liverpool last season and finished 10 points behind the champions in second place. Arsenal have looked to address that with their recruitment and attempts to increase the goal threat from all positions.
Goalkeeper David Raya is frequently kicking the ball long and goals from Kai Havertz and chances created for Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli have come when Arsenal have played the ball into space behind the opposition defence.
The arrival of new set-piece coach Nicolas Jover is expected to ensure the Gunners are again a huge threat in this area.
A new faster-paced attacking style has been evident through summer, especially when Odegaard, Zubimendi and Rice started together.
While Myles Lewis-Skelly impressed by drifting into midfield from left-back during his breakthrough season, there has been more emphasis on him fulfilling traditional full-back duties in this system.
Arteta hopes the changes will benefit Gyokeres and his imposing physical style along with his ability to burst through centre-backs.
What do Arsenal need to do differently to win?
Over last season's 38 league games, Liverpool had in excess of 100 more shots and scored 17 more goals than Arsenal.
Seven of those were penalties but that still leaves a gap of 95 non-penalty shots, 2.5 more shots every game.
If the Gunners had taken the same number of non-penalty shots as the champions and continued scoring at the rate that they did (12.3%) then they would've scored an additional 12 goals, showing that Arsenal's main problem last season was that you can't score the chances you don't make.
Arsenal were decimated by injuries to key players last season, leaving them without key components of their attack.
And that led to performances where Arsenal were kept at bay by sides who defended deep.
They tended to build up slowly with the ball with lots of passes, allowing the defensive team time to regroup, and then resorted to crosses and hoping to win a header.
The 'peak' squad make up
Zubimendi and Gyokeres - aged 26 and 27 respectively - are at or about to hit their peak, and have been brought into the team to win things now.
And the majority of the Arsenal team - and the squad in general - are either at or approaching what we'd consider the peak age of a player's career.
Eight of the '1st XI' last season are aged between 23 and 27, with only Raya who is still at the club older than that.
The connections of Zubimendi and Merino, former team-mates at Real Sociedad, alongside the experience of Odegaard, is another example of what Arsenal are trying to build.
Club coaches have been impressed with the character of their signings as they looked to bring in leaders who are ready to deal with the pressure that will come this season.
Arsenal do have younger players for the future like Lewis-Skelly and Nwaneri (both just 18) while Saka and Califiori are still only 23, but this is a team Arteta believes is ready to win now.
With other summer signings Norgaard, 31 and Kepa Arrizabalada, 30, they have increased the wider squad experience too.

'Top signing for coming years' - all-action Reijnders stars for Man City,"Pep Guardiola describes Tijjani Reijnders as a ""lovely guy"" and ""top signing"" as the Dutchman shines on his Premier League debut for Manchester City.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgr91p4vvg4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 16 Aug 2025 20:03:29",Shamoon Hafez,['Manchester City'],"Remember Kevin de Bruyne?
The Belgian departed Manchester City in the summer and his contributions will never be forgotten, but their fans have a new hero to adore in the shape of Tijjani Reijnders.
The 27-year-old Dutchman delivered an all-action performance, contributing a goal and an assist, as City showed they mean business by thrashing Wolves at Molineux.
Reijnders is only the second City player to both score and provide a goal on his Premier League debut, after Sergio Aguero, and if he achieves even half of what the Argentina striker did, he will be a sure-fire hit for the club.
""It's a great start,"" Reijnders told BBC Match of the Day. ""Very happy with an assist and a goal and a very good win. It is a great start and we have to keep going now.""
Boss Pep Guardiola said of the performance: ""Really good. Lovely guy and has made an impact from day one. His pace, he can help with the holding midfield.
""He can make runs inside the pockets and the spaces that sometimes we allow defenders to create.
""At Milan he was exceptional and with the national team. We knew he is a top signing for the coming years for City.""
Former England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: ""He was sensational, it was almost the perfect midfield performance. It was incredible. He controlled the game at his pace.
""He is an absolute nightmare to play against because he is always on the move.
""The way he ran was a key part for Man City, he just kept going and going and Wolves didn't have the answer. He was brilliant at it, they couldn't cope with him.""
Who is Reijnders?
A powerful box-to-box midfielder, Reijnders made his senior debut for Dutch side PEC Zwolle in 2017 before joining fellow Eredivisie club AZ Alkmaar in early 2018.
After a loan spell with RKC Waalwijk in 2019-20, he went on to establish himself in Alkmaar's first team, his tally of 13 goals and 15 assists in 128 appearances earning him a move to Milan in 2023.
Reijnders ended last season with 10 goals and four assists for the Rossoneri, with only one player in his position, Napoli's Scott McTominay (16), registering more goal involvements.
His fine displays were one of the few positives in a frustrating campaign for Milan, who finished eighth in Serie A and missed out on European qualification altogether.
Reijnders' four assists is perhaps an unfair reflection on his influence in the final third. He was ranked ninth for forward passes in Italy's top flight last term, and was fifth for through balls and carrying the ball.
He also ranked seventh for carries of more than 10 metres in Serie A last season, an asset that could prove crucial in Guardiola's transitional play.
The same goes for his ability to bring out the best in attacking players around him: last season, he was involved in an unrivalled 205 passages of play that ended in a shot being attempted.
Reijnders also ranked second of all Serie A players for secondary chances created (49) - in other words, getting the right players into the best positions to create a chance for a team-mate.
Reijnders has won 23 Netherlands caps, starting all six games for his country at Euro 2024 in Germany last year.
Reijnders 'the star man'
Boss Guardiola has maintained last season's disappointment was down to the number of injuries his side suffered, particularly losing Ballon d'Or winner Rodri to a serious knee injury for most of the campaign.
The Spaniard's absence left a gaping hole and the centre of the park lacked real energy, with Nico Gonzalez signed for £50m from Porto in January and Reijnders added from AC Milan for £42.5m in the summer.
The Dutchman showed glimpses of his capabilities at the Club World Cup but gave fans in England a real taste of what to expect in the Premier League.
Reijnders said: ""I saw the intensity and it is pretty hard, but it is nice to play in the Premier League and to score on my debut is always nice.
""I'm always trying to find space in the box and work to give assists. My type of game is to be a box-to-box player and help the team with goals and assists.""
Reijnders' footwork and chipped pass for the opening goal was sublime, while there was nothing Jose Sa could do for his first-half goal which was clipped across goal and into the bottom corner.
There were also early signs of an understanding building up with star striker Erling Haaland as his disguised pass allowed the Norwegian to net his second goal.
As well as his goal contributions, Reijnders' dominant performance is highlighted by the fact he had 82 touches of the ball and completed 52 of his 57 passes.
Reijnders also completed 22 passes in the final third - the second most in the City team behind Gonzalez (24).
With neither Rodri nor Phil Foden available as they return to full fitness, City's midfield will be a force to be reckoned with once the duo make a comeback.
""Tijjani Reijnders is the star man for me,"" former England full-back Chris Powell said on BBC Radio 5 Live.
""You will see a new-look Man City midfield and you still have Phil Foden and Rodri to come back - they have laid a small marker down.
""For City, it was a disappointing season for them last year, so they have got a lot to play for this year.""
Guardiola has 'no info' on Ederson
James Trafford was another debutant to stand out, keeping a clean sheet following his return from Burnley in the summer.
The 22-year-old Englishman started in goal after Ederson missed the game because of illness and made a total of three saves in an assured performance.
The Brazilian has entered the final year of his contract at Etihad Stadium and has been heavily linked with a move to Turkish giants Galatasaray.
""I don't have info,"" Guardiola said of Ederson's future. ""Yesterday I saw his illness, gastroenteritis, and after I didn't speak to the club.
""If the player wants to leave he has to leave, but on the conditions of the club.
""There is no sense if he is not happy here but the final decision and the way to make the deal belongs 100% to the club, so I don't know what will happen in the next two weeks.""
Guardiola did admit though his main priority was now on thinning his squad.
He said: ""(It's) too much - too many people. I like a deep squad to compete in all competitions but I don't want to leave players at home. It's not healthy. You cannot create a good vibe or atmosphere to compete.
""Everyone has to feel they can play and help. The club has known it since last season, it's not news, but the situation is what it is.
""In the next two weeks, people will talk with players and agents to find a solution.""

'I'm always under pressure' - how Man Utd plan to restore 'good days',"Manchester United have to be significantly better this season. Before their Premier League opener against Arsenal, Simon Stone looks at the task ahead of Ruben Amorim.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8x5d107p0lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 17 Aug 2025 05:48:38",Simon Stone,"['Arsenal', 'Manchester United']","Ruben Amorim used the previous Premier League game at Old Trafford to deliver the most difficult post-season address at Manchester United since Sir Alex Ferguson reflected on 'the most traumatic seven days in the history of the modern club' in 1992.
Then, Ferguson was looking back on a shocking week, when his side lost three successive games to effectively hand what seemed certain to be a first league title in 25 years to Leeds with a game to spare.
Ferguson had a sizeable straw to clutch at given his side had won silverware in three successive campaigns. As it turned out, the long wait to be champions was extended by just 12 months.
There was no safe island that offered Amorim similar refuge on 25 May.
""I want to apologise for this season,"" he said. ""Now, we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past. We either fight each other or we stick together and move forward.
""Today after this disaster season I want to tell you: 'The good days are coming'.""
Amorim has said he will be more cautious with his public statements over the coming months than he has been so far as United's head coach.
It will be a shame if he sticks to this pledge because he speaks with refreshing openness and honesty, which is fabulous for journalists, and also engenders a hope for success from those who appreciate his direct approach.
However, the problem applying spin about a brighter future when addressing a dreadful present is that the future eventually becomes the present, which is where Amorim is now.
How Amorim has adjusted to life at Man Utd
There are few clubs more scrutinised  in world football than Manchester United.
""I am always under pressure to perform,"" said Amorim, as he looked ahead to the Arsenal game. ""It is impossible to be here and not feel the pressure every day.""
Amorim has been United manager for nine months. In that time, he was won 15 games and lost 16, including the most important one, to Tottenham in Bilbao in the Europa League final.
He has also been to Malaysia, where his team were booed off, Hong Kong and the United States. Tens of thousands of fans turned up to watch his side in each of these places.
For every game of the double header in the Premier League Summer Series, an initially sparse crowd for match one turned into an attendance of about 50,000 for the second. That is the reality of life at United. The demands and the numbers of those doing the demanding - fans, sponsors, broadcasters - are enormous.
Amorim now understands this and has made subtle tweaks to reduce the impact.
He has put together a six-player leadership group - Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Noussair Mazraoui, Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot - to run the dressing room so he doesn't have to.
A conscious decision has been taken to reduce his media commitments - both internal and external - to allow him to spend more time 'on the grass'. Even the new media room at United's Carrington training ground has been strategically placed to minimise the distance from his office and the coaches' room close by.
Amorim is by nature a jovial figure. A smile is never far from his face. This summer, that has transmitted itself to the training pitch.
The word from the pre-season training camp in Chicago has been one of positivity. Players are encouraged to take responsibility rather than adhere to the prescriptive discipline of Erik ten Hag's time. Amorim does not have the same stern demeanour as the Dutchman, either when speaking with his players or his coaches.
He is very much a modern man, engaging with fans and happy to take numerous selfies as he routinely stops to meet them at Old Trafford, sometimes two hours after a game has finished.
Yet a code of conduct has been laid out covering a range of subjects, with timekeeping amongst them. Failure to adhere to group standards will not be overlooked.
It was in Chicago where he made the startling admission he travelled to games last term fearing for what was going to happen.
Asked for his current assessment on Friday, his response was measured: ""Confident.
""I know in some moments we will struggle because it is a game against Arsenal [on Sunday]. But we are more prepared, I think.
""I feel we have more players who can help us to change the momentum of the game. We have more options. If things are not working well, we can change things. That gives me more confidence in every game.""
What impact will summer rebuild have?
Amorim could be excused for thinking someone is having a cruel joke at his expense when he assesses an opening that starts with Arsenal at Old Trafford, includes a trip to Manchester City and home game with Chelsea in United's first five games, and then Liverpool at Anfield in match eight on 18 October.
By that point, it will almost be 12 months since the dismissal of Ten Hag and assessments will be being made about what has changed.
And that is the rub.
United, led by chief executive Omar Berrada, went for an imaginative choice rather than the safe options - which included Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Graham Potter - suggested by then sporting director Dan Ashworth as Ten Hag's replacement.
Amorim came to prominence at Sporting by delivering outstanding results with a specific formation. Three central defenders, wing-backs and two inside forwards behind a number nine. The immediate collateral damage in shaping a United squad to fit that system was the discarding of five players - four of whom are senior internationals who prefer to play wide.
The full extent of the additional impact Amorim has made by bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, at a combined cost in the region of £200m, to fill the attacking roles remains to be seen.
However, the intention is for skipper Fernandes to play deeper in one of the two midfield slots. How much meaningful time on the pitch is afforded to England duo Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo, whose contract stand-off remains unresolved, is open to question.
At the back, team selections in five unbeaten games in three countries across pre-season, suggest Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt are battling for a single slot as the middle defender, while Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez, when fit, are vying to be first choice on the left of the three.
De Ligt has proved adept at moving into midfield when United's keeper has the ball. This, Amorim reasons, clears the space for his side to get possession into the areas of the field where they can cause more damage. Fernandes' task, in Amorim's ideal world, is to get on the ball as often as possible, and then make the right decisions.
It's all very technical. In theory, it also provides support in midfield, which tended to be completely overrun during Ten Hag's time because the Dutchman wanted to stretch the space in that area of the field, something Casemiro was not able to do, while none of those asked to partner him made a particular success of either.
Casemiro's game intelligence, his ability to read situations and the Brazilian's calmness under pressure brought him back into favour under Amorim towards the end of last season.
The 33-year-old does not have limitless energy but he was preferred to Christian Eriksen, who was about to leave the club, and, more significantly, Manuel Ugarte, who cost £50.8m to sign from PSG less than 12 months ago, for the Europa League final against Tottenham in May, which United lost.
It seems Amorim regards finding an upgrade in this area of the pitch to be more of a priority than replacing goalkeeper Andre Onana.
That Amorim talks a good game is not in question. Now his team have to deliver.
The target is clear. Amorim has said European qualification is the aim. His players have said the same. More importantly, a financial outlook provided for the club by an external agency spoke about delivering a place in the Europa League at the end of this season as a stepping stone to a return to the Champions League in 2027-28.
It would be unfair to judge United's season on one game, or even eight looking at that fixture list. But, as Amorim has previously said, he used up a lot of goodwill from the stands last season.
He promised this season will be better. It has to be.

Rejuvenated Richarlison helps Frank to 'dream start',A convincing three-goal home win in their opener against Burnley seemed the perfect start to Thomas Frank's Premier League reign at Tottenham - but one factor disappointed the Dane.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn72kpy3rkko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 16 Aug 2025 18:04:16",Michael Emons,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"A convincing three-goal home win in their opener against Burnley seemed the perfect start to Thomas Frank's Premier League reign at Tottenham - but one factor disappointed the Dane.
Such was the beauty of Spurs' second goal, with Richarlison scoring a sensational scissor kick from Mohammed Kudus' cross after a wonderful passing move that swept up the pitch, manager Frank fears nothing will top it this season.
""For the second goal we had 17 passes and every player in the team touched the ball and then an exceptional finish. I'm a bit disappointed as so early on we've had the goal of the season,"" joked Frank.
He had every reason to be in a jovial mood as Spurs and Richarlison were in excellent form for Frank's first home game since he replaced the sacked Ange Postecoglou, who was dismissed 16 days after guiding the club to Europa League glory.
Spurs only needed 10 minutes to grab their first league goal of the season as Richarlison swept home on the turn with a fine finish after good work from Kudus, who has made a promising start following his £55m move from West Ham.
After Richarlison's acrobatics for goal number two, he was then involved in the build-up to the third, before Pape Matar Sarr released Brennan Johnson whose clinical finish made it 3-0 and sealed Frank's winning start.
When the Brazil striker was replaced after 71 minutes, with England striker Dominic Solanke coming on, Richarlison was afforded a standing ovation.
'You have to massage his ego'
Richarlison cost Tottenham £60m when they bought him from Everton three years ago, but only scored four times in the league last season in an injury-hit campaign that included him missing 17 games with a hamstring injury and then a further 10 with a calf injury less than a month later.
""The medical team have done a top job to build him and that's something we need to do throughout the season,"" added Frank.
""The first goal was easier to score without it being easy. To have a striker that takes those two chances helps us win the game. He was very good against PSG [in the midweek Super Cup defeat] and again today with his work-rate, driving the team, linking up the play, hold-up play, just demanding the ball and then the two finishes.
""I've always liked Richarlison and I always thought he was a good player when he played for Everton. When he came to Tottenham he struggled with injuries so we're aware we need to protect and build him. The first signs are good.""
It was not just Frank who was impressed with the striker.
Record Premier League goalscorer Alan Shearer told BBC Sport: ""Richarlison was very impressive this afternoon and his second goal was a phenomenal finish.
""First of all it's great wing play from Mohammed Kudus - just as it was for his first goal.
""Richarlison's going away from goal. You've got to readjust almost every part of your body to get the connection. It's such a difficult technique.""
Ex-England striker Dion Dublin, speaking on Final Score, was another to praise Richarlison, who has played 50 times for Brazil, scoring 20 goals.
""Richarlison has everything he needs to score the goals but he just needs a bit of managing on and off the field,"" said Dublin.
""I believe he is one of these players where you have to massage his ego and say 'You're great, go and play, you're playing every week'. Do that and I think you'll get the rewards.""
Silencing the critics and protestors
Although Tottenham's 2024-25 season ended in glory with their first trophy in 17 years and their first European silverware since 1984, their woeful league performances left them 17th, in their worst position in English football since one campaign in the old Second Division in the late 1970s.
Fan protests were a regular part of last season, although a planned protest on Saturday failed to materialise, apart from a handful of fans outside the stadium holding one banner criticising chairman Daniel Levy, which read: Built a business, killed a football club.
Some supporters have expressed their disappointment at the club's business in the transfer window as Kudus, along with midfielder Joao Palhinha who has joined on a season-long loan from Bayern Munich, have been the only major additions.
Hugely popular club captain Son Heung-min was sold to Los Angeles FC for £18m, while Spurs failed in an attempt to sign England's Morgan Gibbs-White with the midfielder since agreeing a new deal with Nottingham Forest.
But the club are making progress to sign Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze with talks expected to progress in the next 48 hours, while Manchester City winger Savinho remains a target.
The best way for Tottenham and Frank to stop fans protesting is with their performances.
This result, and their showing in the Uefa Super Cup on Wednesday - when they gave European champions Paris St-Germain a huge fright before conceding a 94th-minute equaliser to draw 2-2 and then lose on penalties - has been a good start.
Tottenham have remained as entertaining as they were under Postecoglou, but the early signs under Frank are that the team will be able to do that without the all-out attack and defensively vulnerable nature often displayed under the Australian.
Frank summed it up by saying: ""It was a perfect start, our dream start, but we all know we need to follow on it.
""But today I will just enjoy it, and I hope the players, the club and the fans enjoyed it.""

Spurs to accelerate move for 'natural fit' Eze,Tottenham will accelerate their move to sign Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze with talks expected to progress in the next 48 hours.,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cgjynz9550qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 16 Aug 2025 16:57:42",Sami Mokbel,['Tottenham Hotspur'],"Tottenham will accelerate their move to sign Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze with talks expected to progress in the next 48 hours.
The two Premier League clubs have been in discussions over a move for Eze, 27, since the start of the week.
Multiple sources have told BBC Sport that talks are progressing positively amid growing hope at Tottenham that a deal is now within reach.
Palace face Chelsea on Sunday and there is emerging doubt over Eze's inclusion in the squad, which would provide an indication as to how close the clubs are to reaching an agreement.
The England international has an expired release clause in his contract which was worth an initial £60m, plus a further £8m in add-ons.
It is understood Tottenham are negotiating an offer slightly below the total release figure.
Palace are also in talks over selling captain Marc Guehi to Liverpool.
If Guehi and Eze are sold, the money will be reinvested into the squad with Leicester attacker Bilal El Khannouss among the players Palace are interested in.
Spurs boss Thomas Frank is looking to bolster his options in the final third after attacking midfielder James Maddison was ruled out for the majority of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.
South Korea forward Son Heung-min left the club after 10 years earlier this month, having scored 173 goals in 454 appearances, while midfielder Dejan Kulusevski is still out after knee surgery.
Eze, whose contract at Selhurst Park is due to expire in the summer of 2027, scored 14 goals across all competitions for Palace last season, including in their 1-0 win against Manchester City in the FA Cup final.
He joined Palace from Queens Park Rangers in a deal worth £19.5m in 2020 and has scored 40 goals in 168 appearances.
Eze would be 'well-reasoned' buy - analysis
For Crystal Palace, Eze has found himself playing on the left of the centre forward. Not a typical winger, his role has been akin to a roaming attacking midfielder and, with this freedom, he rewarded Oliver Glasner's side with eight goals and eight assists in the Premier League last season.
This roaming nature would provide Frank with a positionally versatile player that can play in numerous systems. At Palace, Eze has played as one of the two players behind Jean-Philippe Mateta in a 5-2-2-1.
Frank has often opted to play with a counter-attacking 5-3-2 or 5-2-2-1 against more dominant opponents, such as in the Super Cup against Paris St-Germain, mirroring the conditions Eze has thrived in.
His ball-carrying from deep areas in a counter-attacking set-up is incredibly impressive, helping his team get up the pitch with ease. He attracts opponents but his burst, ability to resist contact and accurate passing while running at full speed ensure he reliably dominates the big spaces.
Against weaker sides, Frank's sides are not afraid to dominate the ball while still incorporating direct long balls into their forwards. Pape Matar Sarr impressively picked up the knockdown from the striker in the build-up to two of Spurs' goals against Burnley on Saturday and it is easy to imagine Eze being the recipient here, based on his relationship with Mateta at Palace.
Eze therefore becomes an option as one of the midfield three or as a left winger in Frank's 4-3-3.
Off the ball, he makes these brilliant out-to-in runs from the left flank. This allows him to get into goalscoring positions behind the opponent's right centre-back, a space that Brennan Johnson found himself scoring from against Burnley too. Stylistically, it's an extremely natural fit.
His age profile, experience in the league, tactical fit and positional versatility make this a well-reasoned buy for a Spurs side that have recruited sensibly this window.

Football family stood together on racist abuse - Semenyo,"Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo says the response to the alleged racist abuse he suffered at Liverpool on Friday showed football's ""best side when it mattered most"".",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cewyjj9xnp1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sat, 16 Aug 2025 14:55:33",Tom Mallows,['Liverpool'],"Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo says the response to the alleged racist abuse he suffered at Liverpool on Friday showed football's ""best side when it mattered most"".
Merseyside Police said a 47-year-old man from Liverpool was identified and removed from Anfield before being arrested on Saturday on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and taken into custody for questioning.
Ghana international Semenyo took to Instagram after the game to show more racist abuse he had received, with the caption: ""When will it stop?""
In a further post on Instagram on Saturday, the 25-year-old, who scored twice in Bournemouth's 4-2 defeat, said: ""Last night at Anfield will stay with me forever - not because of one person's words, but because of how the entire football family stood together.
""To my Bournemouth team-mates who supported me in that moment, to the Liverpool players and fans who showed their true character, to the Premier League officials who handled it professionally - thank you. Football showed its best side when it mattered most.
""Scoring those two goals felt like speaking the only language that truly matters on the pitch. This is why I play - for moments like these, for my team-mates, for everyone who believes in what this beautiful game can be.
""The overwhelming messages of support from across the football world remind me why I love this sport. We keep moving forward, together.""
Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk called the incident ""a disgrace"", and said anti-racism campaigns need to do more to eradicate it from the game.
""The only thing we can do is deal with it by dealing with him personally and try to educate the next generation,"" he said. ""That is the only way to try and kick it out, in my opinion.
""I can't believe it. These things shouldn't happen but unfortunately it does and it is an absolute disgrace in my eyes.""
Premier League chief executive Richard Masters says anyone guilty of racist abuse will be banned from stadiums and could face prosecution.
""No Premier League footballer should ever have to, in their workplace or online, suffer that sort of abuse. It is important that we keep saying that,"" Masters told BBC Sport.
""It is a problem for society. It leaks into football, and it shouldn't happen in a football stadium. It shouldn't happen online.
""It makes people like me and other football people in charge of the game think twice about what else we can do to ensure that these things don't happen in the future.
""If you are found to be using discriminatory language inside a football ground you will be ejected, second you will be banned, and third you may face criminal charges.""
The Premier League says it is investigating the incident and has offered its support to Semenyo and both clubs.
Instagram's owner Meta said it is investigating and will take action against any offending comments and accounts.
'Are we shocked?' - Scott
The incident comes just days after Mathys Tel received online abuse following his penalty miss in Tottenham's Super Cup defeat by Paris St-Germain.
Last month England defender Jess Carter revealed she had been the target of racist abuse during Euro 2025.
In response, the Lionesses stopped the anti-racism gesture of taking the knee before matches as they argued it was ""clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism"".
The Premier League has confirmed all players will be asked to take the knee before two games in October to highlight their anti-discrimination commitments.
On Tuesday, Carter said she feared her England team-mate Lauren James would suffer ""astronomical"" racist abuse if she had been the only player to have missed a penalty in their Euros quarter-final shootout win against Sweden.
Former Lionesses defender Alex Scott said she was not shocked by the news of Semenyo's abuse.
""If you look over the course of the summer - Jess Carter, Lauren James. The Lionesses refuse to take the knee as it doesn't mean anything,"" she told Football Focus.
""Look at the [Tottenham] game midweek. Racial slurs happening. The abuse players are getting and the first [Premier League] game of the season it happens again. Are we shocked?
""It is frustrating I have to sit in this chair and talk about it. No doubt coming off this show I will get racially abused because I am speaking about it, once again.""
Speaking on Football Focus, former England striker Dion Dublin said: ""How long has it been going on for? It is too long. If I could swear right now - I would.
""It is just wrong. For the players to go on the pitch thinking this could happen. It is so annoying that nothing has been done.
""I don't want football to keep getting the blame for this. This is society. We have got it wrong somewhere.""
